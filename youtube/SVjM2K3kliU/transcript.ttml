<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">sorry that we had to miss last month but</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.080" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">in some ways the world ended so you guys</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">know what what was happening but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:23.100" style="s2">reconfiguring the world right now and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">I&#39;m in a different place but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.100" end="00:00:28.380" style="s2">do the Q&amp;A nevertheless so let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">we&#39;ll work our way down and see we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.380" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">a bit of time to take questions from</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:39.420" style="s2">people that are online chat so the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.120" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">question is from Clinton who&#39;s a patron</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.420" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">so thank you for your support Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">it&#39;s another long question so I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:46.410" style="s2">and read it very carefully at the lean a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">little bit there because the way the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.410" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">screens are guys so it&#39;s all improvised</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">and adduct okay could you address more</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">the bad trip aspects of the spiritual or</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">revelatory experience which might lead</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">to trauma paranoia</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">megalomania delusion I am worrying it us</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">into the sort of discussion you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">that there is somewhat of a row extent</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">of the experience of engagement in</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:09.860" style="s2">dialog with deeper truths can an</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">authentic experience of the sort lack</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.860" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">confrontation with the ills and evils of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:17.450" style="s2">and immense sorrow fear disgust</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">mortality and temptation towards power</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.450" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">so that&#39;s an excellent question Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:24.689" style="s2">I would point you to one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">talks I gave I think is the very thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.689" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">that gave I think it was a I think was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">mindmatters talk on altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">consciousness and one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">was trying to argue and I do argue is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">that because these states put us in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">situation in which our salience</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">landscape is being transformed and being</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">altered they do make us tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">liable vulnerable to bullshitting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">self-deception and so I&#39;ve always argued</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">I will continue to argue that it is I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">think wrong both epistemic Lee and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">morally to pursue these higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">consciousness these kinds of what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:13.060" style="s2">termed revelatory experiences in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:15.130" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.060" end="00:02:16.569" style="s2">handed from the cultivation of wisdom I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.130" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">think that&#39;s a deep mistake</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.569" end="00:02:22.120" style="s2">I think we have to independently</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">cultivate skills and virtues for seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:26.020" style="s2">through self-deception through the ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:29.290" style="s2">in which we ourselves and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.020" end="00:02:32.110" style="s2">tracking with good reason and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.290" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">the real patterns in the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.110" end="00:02:36.340" style="s2">that has to be integrated with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:38.500" style="s2">cultivation of higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.340" end="00:02:41.950" style="s2">consciousness transformative experiences</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.500" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">I think the artistry by which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.950" end="00:02:46.450" style="s2">reformulating our sensibility in these</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:50.470" style="s2">higher cognitive state higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.450" end="00:02:53.860" style="s2">higher consciousness always needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.470" end="00:02:57.549" style="s2">wedded to the the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.860" end="00:03:01.180" style="s2">argumentation and reflection and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.549" end="00:03:05.170" style="s2">the discernment of the sage and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.180" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">think I&#39;m going to take this as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.170" end="00:03:14.170" style="s2">opportunity of saying that I challenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:16.150" style="s2">the I think romantic interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.170" end="00:03:18.760" style="s2">these states or the use of substances</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.150" end="00:03:20.260" style="s2">that engender these states in which the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.760" end="00:03:23.140" style="s2">point is just to have an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.260" end="00:03:26.829" style="s2">experience that somehow expresses our</p>

<p begin="00:03:26.829" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">think the attempt to demonize or deify</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">psyche is a deep mistake and that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.260" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">very prone to self-deception in such</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">higher states of consciousness but that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not valuable</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:49.959" style="s2">the higher states of consciousness have</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">optimized in many ways compositionally a</p>

<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">nevertheless we need to bring in</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.110" end="00:04:39.039" style="s2">Connor how would you compare and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.970" end="00:04:41.289" style="s2">contrast belief versus making something</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.039" end="00:04:44.099" style="s2">viable for oneself related to escaping</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.289" end="00:04:48.190" style="s2">existential inertia and self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.099" end="00:04:50.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s actually good so existential</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.190" end="00:04:57.849" style="s2">inertia is when we&#39;re trapped within a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.440" end="00:04:59.470" style="s2">particular worldview and we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.849" end="00:05:02.590" style="s2">know how to get out of it very often</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.470" end="00:05:04.449" style="s2">people go into therapy because and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.590" end="00:05:06.310" style="s2">is where the answer to Connors question</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.449" end="00:05:09.099" style="s2">can begin because they often have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.310" end="00:05:10.569" style="s2">correct beliefs they might believe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.099" end="00:05:13.060" style="s2">they might believe that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.569" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">too avoided they have a proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.060" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">even might be well evidenced justify</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:23.770" style="s2">that they assent to but it is inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:25.870" style="s2">for them being able to become the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.770" end="00:05:27.849" style="s2">of person they want to be that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.870" end="00:05:30.219" style="s2">they go into therapy people very rarely</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.849" end="00:05:32.380" style="s2">go into therapy without some beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.219" end="00:05:35.349" style="s2">Ettrick says that something is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:38.409" style="s2">they can usually state what is wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.349" end="00:05:41.380" style="s2">stating what is wrong is very different</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.409" end="00:05:44.590" style="s2">from knowing how to aspire how to engage</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.380" end="00:05:47.169" style="s2">in transformation how to reconfigure</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.590" end="00:05:50.169" style="s2">your salience landscape how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.169" end="00:05:52.539" style="s2">configure the agent arena relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.169" end="00:05:57.279" style="s2">how to find out how to find different</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.539" end="00:05:58.840" style="s2">ways of being right that will afford you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.279" end="00:06:00.729" style="s2">getting out of the place where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.840" end="00:06:03.430" style="s2">locked or stuff that&#39;s what I mean about</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.729" end="00:06:05.409" style="s2">making something viable for something to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.430" end="00:06:08.050" style="s2">be viable is precisely when you get a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.409" end="00:06:10.870" style="s2">stacking as my friend Jordan Hall says</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.050" end="00:06:14.199" style="s2">of the four kinds of knowing when the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.870" end="00:06:16.840" style="s2">propositional knowing is afforded by and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.199" end="00:06:19.539" style="s2">in concert with your skills being</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.840" end="00:06:21.580" style="s2">powerful and those skills are afforded</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.539" end="00:06:24.520" style="s2">by are afforded by you in concert with</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.580" end="00:06:27.389" style="s2">your perspective of knowing giving you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.520" end="00:06:30.460" style="s2">good reliable situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.389" end="00:06:33.099" style="s2">which is concert with your participatory</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.460" end="00:06:35.770" style="s2">knowing which is ways adopting</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.099" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">existential modes forms of life as</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.770" end="00:06:39.370" style="s2">vicarage might say that properly Co</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:40.869" style="s2">shaped you in the environment and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.370" end="00:06:42.879" style="s2">know whether these are work</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.869" end="00:06:44.830" style="s2">and you know what it&#39;s not working like</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.879" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">when you go to another culture or where</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.830" end="00:06:48.009" style="s2">you&#39;re in solitary confinement and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:50.139" style="s2">things become unglued in that fashion</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.009" end="00:06:51.849" style="s2">so viability for me means that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.139" end="00:06:55.270" style="s2">getting a stacking of the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.849" end="00:06:57.129" style="s2">knowing such that you&#39;re getting all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.270" end="00:07:01.300" style="s2">the ways you&#39;re getting all of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.820" end="00:11:24.140" style="s2">it seems that if I&#39;m doing it wrong it</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.190" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">and integrated questioning and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.930" end="00:12:07.310" style="s2">part of my answer there is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:09.530" style="s2">really in the meditation per se that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.310" end="00:12:12.200" style="s2">will tell you if you&#39;re doing it right I</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.130" end="00:12:19.280" style="s2">different from what you&#39;re asking you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.280" end="00:12:25.190" style="s2">justifies this being the right way so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.730" end="00:12:26.990" style="s2">use the example often that in meditating</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.190" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">you&#39;re stepping back and looking at your</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.990" end="00:12:30.950" style="s2">mind rather than automatically looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:33.860" style="s2">through it but happen because you might</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.950" end="00:12:37.100" style="s2">notice distortions in on the lenses</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.860" end="00:12:39.500" style="s2">distortion distorting patterns right of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.100" end="00:12:41.960" style="s2">processing in your mind but how do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.500" end="00:12:43.130" style="s2">know that that was a distortion there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.960" end="00:12:44.630" style="s2">something on the lens but how do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.130" end="00:12:46.310" style="s2">know well this is what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.630" end="00:12:48.440" style="s2">you also have to practice putting on</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.310" end="00:12:52.670" style="s2">your glasses and looking out and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.440" end="00:12:55.100" style="s2">if you see things new the meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.670" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">working if not you&#39;re getting you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.100" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">insight so much in the meditation but if</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:01.910" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to have moments of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:04.610" style="s2">connectedness realization insight in</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.610" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">right that reduce conflict that afford a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.210" end="00:13:12.080" style="s2">sense of connectedness to yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:15.740" style="s2">others but more important than your</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.729" end="00:14:35.669" style="s2">well I&#39;m doing this because I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.129" end="00:14:45.389" style="s2">to sort of take that provisionally</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.319" end="00:14:47.489" style="s2">because this is your it&#39;s going to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.389" end="00:14:49.379" style="s2">better it&#39;s like when you&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.309" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">hand you draw it really properly right</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.799" end="00:14:59.909" style="s2">and then you look at real circles and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:01.739" style="s2">you go back and forth but then you start</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.909" end="00:15:02.759" style="s2">to also feel from the inside oh I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.739" end="00:15:04.559" style="s2">sort of feel the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.759" end="00:15:06.659" style="s2">drawing a good circle and a bad circle</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.559" end="00:15:08.069" style="s2">and then oh and now I notice things</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.659" end="00:15:09.989" style="s2">about real circles that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.069" end="00:15:14.539" style="s2">noticing before and you do it until you</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.539" end="00:15:19.859" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s what I meant it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.909" end="00:15:22.739" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it correctly but that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.859" end="00:15:27.769" style="s2">correctly is always a self-correcting</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.739" end="00:15:31.559" style="s2">process within that loop okay so</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:16:02.710" style="s2">it&#39;s I would put it more than its its</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.430" end="00:16:03.970" style="s2">yeah that language is maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.710" end="00:16:06.010" style="s2">stronger than I would like I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.970" end="00:16:08.530" style="s2">it&#39;s more like loosening up the process</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.010" end="00:16:11.470" style="s2">of Co identification the process by</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.530" end="00:16:13.780" style="s2">which I&#39;m us assuming an identity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.470" end="00:16:15.310" style="s2">assigning identities and what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.780" end="00:16:17.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t want that to be happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.310" end="00:16:19.180" style="s2">unconsciously mindlessly and reactively</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.500" end="00:16:21.610" style="s2">I want to be able to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.180" end="00:16:22.810" style="s2">awareness in in it because if I bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.610" end="00:16:25.480" style="s2">awareness then there&#39;s the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.810" end="00:16:29.200" style="s2">of discernment there&#39;s the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.480" end="00:16:32.770" style="s2">of remembering not just in thought but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.200" end="00:16:34.900" style="s2">in being sati remembering I am more and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.770" end="00:16:38.170" style="s2">other than this identity I&#39;ve assumed</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.900" end="00:16:40.930" style="s2">and in a resonant fashion that person is</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.170" end="00:16:43.750" style="s2">more and other than the identity I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.930" end="00:16:46.300" style="s2">assigned and perhaps if I engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.750" end="00:16:48.850" style="s2">reciprocal opening I can come to relate</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.300" end="00:16:51.580" style="s2">to that person not a cavern mode but in</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.850" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">the bien mode and / and perhaps not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.580" end="00:16:58.140" style="s2">that person but to Asia or the world and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:17:01.420" style="s2">and perhaps right if I can more reliably</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.140" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">remember to be in the being mode in</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.420" end="00:17:06.010" style="s2">relating to things that I can afford</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:09.430" style="s2">with the being mode of force I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.010" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">afford development and I can then see my</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.430" end="00:17:14.290" style="s2">identity as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:17.350" style="s2">aspirational that I&#39;m developing rather</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.290" end="00:17:20.260" style="s2">than something that I have or possess or</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.350" end="00:17:21.180" style="s2">merely control this is very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.260" end="00:17:24.700" style="s2">Socrates&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.180" end="00:17:26.890" style="s2">proposal to us Christopher Moore in his</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.700" end="00:17:28.690" style="s2">book on Socrates and self-knowledge it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.890" end="00:17:31.500" style="s2">like makes the argument that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.690" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">was offering the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.500" end="00:17:36.580" style="s2">aspirational self in place of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:39.010" style="s2">that sort of common sense or romantic</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.580" end="00:17:42.820" style="s2">sense of the self as what we have within</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.010" end="00:17:44.200" style="s2">us that&#39;s constant and static and sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:49.880" style="s2">of unchanging</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.200" end="00:17:51.860" style="s2">so the next question is from Dan patron</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.880" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">excellent some of the conversations I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.860" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">have with them are sort of mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:18:00.140" style="s2">expanding I really admire the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:03.290" style="s2">flexibility the scope and the dynoed the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.140" end="00:18:05.030" style="s2">dynamic quality of dance thinking his</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.290" end="00:18:06.740" style="s2">question is what role if any do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.030" end="00:18:09.020" style="s2">think that hubris and nemesis are</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.740" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">playing in the present unfolding of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.020" end="00:18:15.020" style="s2">meta-crisis I think it&#39;s important first</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:17.660" style="s2">of all to bring that up and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.020" end="00:18:19.970" style="s2">first and this came up in a really</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.660" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">excellent discussion if it was good back</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.970" end="00:18:26.059" style="s2">and forth between Reed Kelly and I on</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:28.610" style="s2">this about you know that we tended to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.059" end="00:18:30.049" style="s2">take we tended to do a couple thing so</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.610" end="00:18:31.910" style="s2">Zack Stein is making a very good</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.049" end="00:18:34.340" style="s2">argument that in in the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.910" end="00:18:36.440" style="s2">we&#39;re in and Jordan Hollis has talked</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.340" end="00:18:38.540" style="s2">about this and so if I we-we&#39;re tend to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.440" end="00:18:40.760" style="s2">fallen back on mythopoetic ways of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.540" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2">thinking what we followed by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.760" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">mythopoetic because mythopoetic thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.860" end="00:18:49.070" style="s2">is imaginal it&#39;s symbolic its gestural</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:51.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of trying to stop all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.070" end="00:18:53.770" style="s2">kinds of knowing so it has this great</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.140" end="00:18:56.090" style="s2">vertical integration mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.770" end="00:18:58.220" style="s2">patterns are also ones that have</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.090" end="00:19:00.860" style="s2">survived across the most cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.220" end="00:19:03.080" style="s2">context their perennial patterns in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.860" end="00:19:05.390" style="s2">way and so they&#39;re look they&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.080" end="00:19:07.580" style="s2">likely to be transferable to our current</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.390" end="00:19:11.030" style="s2">context so they have great vertical and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.580" end="00:19:12.350" style="s2">horizontal integration but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.030" end="00:19:15.260" style="s2">mean the myth of poetic stuff doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.350" end="00:19:16.940" style="s2">come up with without danger I mean so a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.260" end="00:19:18.919" style="s2">lot of the mythopoetic stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.940" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">coming up for people with the dacovia</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.919" end="00:19:25.750" style="s2">crisis is kind of this weird you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:28.330" style="s2">almost old testament you know biblical</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.750" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">you know deity it&#39;s it&#39;s ubiquitous</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:37.669" style="s2">invisible and it can strike us without</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.030" end="00:19:39.590" style="s2">without notice and it causes us to all</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.669" end="00:19:42.559" style="s2">mistrust each other and it&#39;s demanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.590" end="00:19:44.540" style="s2">tremendous purity codes from us and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.559" end="00:19:47.960" style="s2">can get us into a kind of thinking in</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.960" end="00:19:53.900" style="s2">trying to you know deal with the impure</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:57.400" style="s2">can&#39;t come to mind so the mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.900" end="00:20:00.460" style="s2">stuff comes up and the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.400" end="00:20:04.690" style="s2">has left us into place where we&#39;re sadly</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.140" end="00:20:18.610" style="s2">and so this mythopoetic stuff can come</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.809" end="00:20:21.580" style="s2">up and it can make be incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.610" end="00:20:24.910" style="s2">inflationary for us it can give us a</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.420" end="00:20:46.179" style="s2">reflective rationality to bear on it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.350" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">what does that mean that means that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.179" end="00:20:50.920" style="s2">addition think about and this is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:54.010" style="s2">know that goes back to the point I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.920" end="00:20:56.620" style="s2">making with ray of Kelly our culture has</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.010" end="00:20:59.040" style="s2">become really fascinated with the hero</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.620" end="00:21:01.809" style="s2">and his rave Kelly pointed out I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.040" end="00:21:04.120" style="s2">misunderstood this a bit because he</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.809" end="00:21:06.370" style="s2">thinks the hero archetype you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.120" end="00:21:09.429" style="s2">culture has been reduced to the warrior</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.370" end="00:21:11.470" style="s2">and what we have is all of the yang of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.429" end="00:21:15.550" style="s2">the hero and none of the year none of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.470" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">the receptivity and so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.550" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">there&#39;s that way in which we&#39;re warping</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">it and so and you can think about how</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:28.030" style="s2">the warrior archetype is so in sync with</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">that kind of us versus them and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.030" end="00:21:34.270" style="s2">purity code and conquest and control</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:37.390" style="s2">right so there&#39;s that confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.270" end="00:21:39.130" style="s2">secondly we&#39;ve forgotten that yes the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.390" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">Greeks gave us hero myths</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.130" end="00:21:43.750" style="s2">you know Theseus and Odysseus but for</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:47.110" style="s2">every hero myth they also give us a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.750" end="00:21:49.179" style="s2">hubris myth they give us Icarus and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.110" end="00:21:51.490" style="s2">give us Phaeton and they give us a rack</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.179" end="00:21:53.770" style="s2">net people who tried to conquer the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.490" end="00:21:56.020" style="s2">domain of the gods inflation and were</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.770" end="00:21:58.270" style="s2">smashed because of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.020" end="00:22:01.900" style="s2">and we got to remember the hubris side</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.270" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">of right of our mythological education</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.900" end="00:22:07.150" style="s2">to counterbalance the temptations</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:10.380" style="s2">towards inflation and a almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.150" end="00:22:12.450" style="s2">militaristic response and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.380" end="00:22:14.910" style="s2">worried about the the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.450" end="00:22:17.100" style="s2">this biblical language a days of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.910" end="00:22:19.320" style="s2">judgment it this way of thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.100" end="00:22:21.570" style="s2">and the fact that we&#39;re calling it</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.320" end="00:22:24.030" style="s2">plague right and also this the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.570" end="00:22:25.590" style="s2">militaristic language of reign of war we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.030" end="00:22:27.540" style="s2">have to fight it at conquer and we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.590" end="00:22:29.880" style="s2">to find out and the rise of all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.540" end="00:22:33.780" style="s2">conspiratorial thinking so again we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.880" end="00:22:36.710" style="s2">to be very very careful right with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.780" end="00:22:43.020" style="s2">mythopoetic stuff that comes up and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.710" end="00:22:46.500" style="s2">we have to re-educate ourselves in terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.020" end="00:22:49.560" style="s2">of the that like the ecology of you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.500" end="00:22:52.260" style="s2">the systemic relationship between myths</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.560" end="00:22:55.650" style="s2">and how they try to get it give us a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.260" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">virtual governor the hero myth right it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.650" end="00:23:00.120" style="s2">enables us it encourages us but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">hubris myths there are selective</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.120" end="00:23:04.860" style="s2">constraint limiting us so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:07.220" style="s2">become inflationary we don&#39;t be we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.860" end="00:23:10.620" style="s2">give in to militaristic conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.220" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">purity code narratives so I think all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.620" end="00:23:17.850" style="s2">this is tremendously important and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:21.510" style="s2">fact that many of us write our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.850" end="00:23:23.670" style="s2">religiously illiterate and also we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.510" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">illiterate because the way our culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.670" end="00:23:30.090" style="s2">has functioned about dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:32.100" style="s2">this mythopoetic machinery that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.090" end="00:23:33.960" style="s2">worrying thing and so I&#39;m worried that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.100" end="00:23:36.450" style="s2">what following what&#39;s going to follow on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.960" end="00:23:40.950" style="s2">the heels for example of the co-lead</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.450" end="00:23:42.870" style="s2">crisis is a sort of an accelerated you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.950" end="00:23:44.910" style="s2">know mental health crisis the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.870" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">crisis is being exacerbated in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.910" end="00:23:50.130" style="s2">by this so I think we need to be I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:52.610" style="s2">there was an excellent question by Dan I</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.130" end="00:23:55.920" style="s2">think we need to bring back the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.610" end="00:24:00.270" style="s2">self-organizing ecology of mythology of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.920" end="00:24:02.520" style="s2">entire systems of myth and use that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.270" end="00:24:04.260" style="s2">discussion with our best reflected</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.520" end="00:24:06.690" style="s2">philosophical best philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.260" end="00:24:10.500" style="s2">reflection and scientific understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.690" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">so that we craft a virtual engine in</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.500" end="00:24:15.630" style="s2">which that that mythopoetic way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:18.760" style="s2">thinking and being can come to an</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.630" end="00:24:22.610" style="s2">adaptive expression</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.760" end="00:24:25.280" style="s2">so another question from David sweat</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.610" end="00:24:29.180" style="s2">Lowe a patron and I&#39;m always grateful</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.280" end="00:24:32.410" style="s2">for it for a lot of the commentary and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.180" end="00:24:34.820" style="s2">involvement that David has in my work</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.410" end="00:24:36.680" style="s2">David&#39;s question is the following my</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.820" end="00:24:39.020" style="s2">contemplative work centers on how</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.680" end="00:24:41.570" style="s2">propositional trust differs from</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.020" end="00:24:43.490" style="s2">participatory trust and moves from a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.570" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">thesis of obeying external authority</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.490" end="00:24:47.660" style="s2">through the antithesis of listening to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.790" style="s2">inner Authority towards a synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.660" end="00:24:52.130" style="s2">mutual authority between me and my arena</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.790" end="00:24:54.410" style="s2">in participatory knowing this feels like</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.130" end="00:24:55.970" style="s2">the god that is not a god but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.410" end="00:24:58.670" style="s2">temptation to give in to grandiosity</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.970" end="00:25:00.560" style="s2">becomes intense you have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.670" end="00:25:02.300" style="s2">personal struggle as you strive to be of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.560" end="00:25:04.130" style="s2">service to this effective moment if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.300" end="00:25:08.270" style="s2">talk about that wow that is fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.130" end="00:25:10.340" style="s2">question and it&#39;s fantastic because</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.270" end="00:25:13.940" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s sort of work the way into it</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.340" end="00:25:15.950" style="s2">so David is you know the God that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.940" end="00:25:18.440" style="s2">a god or the god that&#39;s beyond god this</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.950" end="00:25:20.450" style="s2">is teller and Tillich importantly talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.440" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">about these three ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.450" end="00:25:25.880" style="s2">understand the authority with terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:27.830" style="s2">which we understand normativity Tillett</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.880" end="00:25:29.570" style="s2">talked about heteronomous that&#39;s when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.830" end="00:25:32.870" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s an external authority</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.570" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">imposing on us and then what we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.870" end="00:25:36.980" style="s2">largely done from the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.790" end="00:25:40.430" style="s2">onward I mean like the historical period</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.980" end="00:25:43.310" style="s2">is we have resisted arguments of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.430" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">authority that normativity Authority</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.310" end="00:25:51.140" style="s2">arguments at least we do that officially</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:56.750" style="s2">and we have we have instead given our</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.140" end="00:25:59.720" style="s2">allegiance to autonomy the the the so</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.750" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">what matters it is autonomy and virtues</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.720" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">like that like one understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.570" end="00:26:06.770" style="s2">authenticity not the hi to Gary emotion</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.700" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">but a more prevalent common notion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.770" end="00:26:11.780" style="s2">authenticity you know and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:16.490" style="s2">autonomous and a completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.780" end="00:26:18.920" style="s2">self-governing and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.490" end="00:26:23.090" style="s2">important and caught was caught late</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.920" end="00:26:26.540" style="s2">sees three critiques you put a pure</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.090" end="00:26:27.800" style="s2">reason practical reason cetera and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.540" end="00:26:29.100" style="s2">point about this and this is Hubbard</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.800" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">Mouse&#39;s point he</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.100" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">is autonomy right it&#39;s an extent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:37.080" style="s2">part of that Cartesian subjectivity that</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">ultimately I&#39;m the only authority on</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.080" end="00:26:42.390" style="s2">myself and what&#39;s that done for us well</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:45.650" style="s2">that has limited these because what</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.390" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">happens is that reason morality and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.650" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">aesthetics truth goodness and beauty are</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">fragmented and separate they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.390" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">David is talking about that resonance</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.930" end="00:33:46.830" style="s2">to use the distinction from Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.370" end="00:33:49.170" style="s2">Pascal made a distinction between the</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.170" end="00:33:53.070" style="s2">finesse the spirit of geometry is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.020" style="s2">how we have normally experienced time</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.780" end="00:34:05.550" style="s2">spirit of geometry but when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.610" end="00:34:08.370" style="s2">Kairos you have to move to what Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.550" end="00:34:10.950" style="s2">called the spirit of finesse now finesse</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.370" end="00:34:13.350" style="s2">and notice how this makes sense with</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.950" end="00:34:15.540" style="s2">respect to Kairos a finesse the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.350" end="00:34:18.270" style="s2">of finesse is that combination of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.540" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">procedural and perspective I will and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.270" end="00:34:23.490" style="s2">even participatory knowing that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:25.649" style="s2">right that&#39;s about timing and placing</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.490" end="00:34:28.440" style="s2">because when you&#39;re in the car us the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.649" end="00:34:31.560" style="s2">timing and the placing of your actions</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.440" end="00:34:34.710" style="s2">can have huge consequences and so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.560" end="00:34:38.460" style="s2">need to have that cultivated sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.710" end="00:34:41.130" style="s2">finesse and so if you have that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.460" end="00:34:43.470" style="s2">cultivated sense of finesse that puts</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.130" end="00:34:46.919" style="s2">you into a continuity of contact so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">you&#39;re in right relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:51.659" style="s2">course of events and you can write you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">can with your actions you have that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.659" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">discernment the right timing and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:58.860" style="s2">right placement so think about the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:35:03.090" style="s2">an example I sometimes use like if you</p>

<p begin="00:51:06.340" end="00:51:10.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a higher purpose that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.920" end="00:51:15.150" style="s2">we have to really limit it and constrain</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.750" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">it and I think that in moments of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.150" end="00:51:20.200" style="s2">some of the deepest patterns that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:23.980" style="s2">have of connecting to other people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.200" end="00:51:28.300" style="s2">in play right and what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.980" end="00:51:30.370" style="s2">is those people are saying that their</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.300" end="00:51:33.010" style="s2">affinity and their connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.370" end="00:51:35.950" style="s2">logos of the Kairos of how its unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.010" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">itself organizing and making a new way</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.950" end="00:51:42.010" style="s2">of being possible needs to be given</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">priority at this time precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.010" end="00:51:48.070" style="s2">we&#39;re in Kairos and there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">important way in which the field of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.070" end="00:51:54.250" style="s2">human experience and being can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.520" end="00:51:59.050" style="s2">fundamentally expanded and enriched for</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.250" end="00:52:02.470" style="s2">many many people and so when it is clear</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.050" end="00:52:05.560" style="s2">that that&#39;s the case then what should do</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.470" end="00:52:07.750" style="s2">that and so I think what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.560" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">the only time in which you&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.750" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">make that kind of sacrifice is when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:19.390" style="s2">you&#39;re in clear Kairos and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:23.140" style="s2">kind of overwhelming calling by that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.390" end="00:52:27.640" style="s2">Kairos and that is going to afford you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.140" end="00:52:29.860" style="s2">becoming well the Messiah or the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.640" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">and since that&#39;s highly unlikely for</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.860" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">most of us I would say that that calling</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">better be really really powerful and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">better be leading to a progression that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:45.430" style="s2">is reliably being recognized by other</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">people as opening up a new way of being</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.430" end="00:52:51.610" style="s2">that is the appropriate course of action</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:55.770" style="s2">in the Kairos so that&#39;s how I would try</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.610" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">it put some very significant limitations</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.770" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">on trying to adopt the example of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:06.500" style="s2">Siddhartha</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:08.990" style="s2">or Jesus of Nazareth Rollag on us</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.500" end="00:53:11.410" style="s2">if introverts are adapted for social</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.990" end="00:53:14.120" style="s2">condition situations what are introverts</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.410" end="00:53:17.330" style="s2">adapted for us so I think introverts are</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.120" end="00:53:19.850" style="s2">adopted we have you know these two these</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.330" end="00:53:23.360" style="s2">two draws till it talks about the be</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.850" end="00:53:25.990" style="s2">right in individuation and it overlaps</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.360" end="00:53:28.610" style="s2">with Jung&#39;s notion and participation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.990" end="00:53:31.250" style="s2">what is it we&#39;re most trying to do in an</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.610" end="00:53:32.810" style="s2">event individuation it&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.250" end="00:53:34.670" style="s2">the romantic notion of you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.810" end="00:53:36.980" style="s2">realizing our true self that was always</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.670" end="00:53:40.010" style="s2">there or collecting our autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.980" end="00:53:43.790" style="s2">specialness the idea is a</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.790" end="00:53:47.480" style="s2">conflict and affords optimal</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.620" end="00:53:51.710" style="s2">functionality and therefore is in</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.480" end="00:53:55.460" style="s2">service of the other drive to drive to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.710" end="00:53:57.950" style="s2">participate the drive to be connected to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.460" end="00:54:00.770" style="s2">reality but the drive to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.950" end="00:54:03.920" style="s2">reality should be internal izybelle</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.770" end="00:54:05.870" style="s2">and give and afford us that better at</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:08.030" style="s2">complexification getting the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.870" end="00:54:09.950" style="s2">functions that reduce into conflict</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.030" end="00:54:13.010" style="s2">so if extroverts are great at</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.950" end="00:54:15.380" style="s2">participation introverts are directed</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.010" end="00:54:17.930" style="s2">towards the the add activity of trying</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.380" end="00:54:20.420" style="s2">to realize inner peace of course what we</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.930" end="00:54:22.370" style="s2">want is an optimal relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.420" end="00:54:24.410" style="s2">them which is why probably in</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.370" end="00:54:26.090" style="s2">evolutionary terms we tend to get a</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.410" end="00:54:28.430" style="s2">distribution of our population between</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.090" end="00:54:32.870" style="s2">introverts and extroverts so that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.430" end="00:54:35.120" style="s2">have lived reminders of the importance</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.870" end="00:54:37.700" style="s2">of the connectedness to the world and to</p>
