<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:49.860" style="s2">career I would say that everybody crafts</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:51.719" style="s2">their personality for the medium so if</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.860" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">I&#39;m writing a blog post I&#39;m a slightly</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">my interview personality and slightly</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">different from my periscope personnel so</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">yes I do craft them but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">they&#39;re all me I mean none of them are</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">none of them are I would consider them</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">inauthentic because they&#39;re they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">just an aspect of me that I either</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">emphasize or de-emphasize yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting part about Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">in that people still have this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">Twitter is like your personal Canon or</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">like the ultimate statement of who you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">are and your ideas and your beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">your morals and such but and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">understand that in order to have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">sort of Twitter momentum or success it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">has to be some element of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">performance and it&#39;s not inauthentic as</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">you say but it is it is exaggerated</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t know some areas are over</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">emphasized or others and some things are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:53.899" style="s2">just meant to be done on a meta Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">level that aren&#39;t reflective of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.899" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">personality or your I&#39;m sorry of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:01:59.790" style="s2">your true inner beliefs or how you would</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">deal with your wife if she was sitting</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">right there or whatever and do yous do</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:06.470" style="s2">you see is that something that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.860" end="00:02:09.460" style="s2">are ever gonna understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.470" end="00:02:12.290" style="s2">or well meet the Bible forever or what</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.460" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">your best example of this multiple</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.290" end="00:02:17.060" style="s2">personality stuff is President Trump</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">because he has a Twitter personality</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:21.020" style="s2">that&#39;s different from his meeting a head</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:23.330" style="s2">of state which is different from his you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.020" end="00:02:24.980" style="s2">know every other context and what people</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.330" end="00:02:28.220" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is that when he&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.980" end="00:02:29.900" style="s2">Twitter he goes into Twitter personality</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:32.870" style="s2">yeah which it which is far more</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.900" end="00:02:35.060" style="s2">troll-like you know it&#39;s it&#39;s the Wild</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.870" end="00:02:37.820" style="s2">West and when he when he enters that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.060" end="00:02:40.010" style="s2">frame and becomes the the Twitter using</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.820" end="00:02:41.900" style="s2">guy he does it better than anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.010" end="00:02:44.120" style="s2">ever done it yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.900" end="00:02:46.010" style="s2">that requires almost you know a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.120" end="00:02:48.260" style="s2">wrestling kind of you know big</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.010" end="00:02:49.940" style="s2">personality and then when he&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.260" end="00:02:52.820" style="s2">different context he has to meet you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.940" end="00:02:55.220" style="s2">know President Xi or something he just</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.820" end="00:02:57.260" style="s2">goes into a different mode and if and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.220" end="00:03:00.440" style="s2">people look at the the tweets and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.260" end="00:03:01.850" style="s2">say hey the guy who sent that tweet we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.440" end="00:03:03.530" style="s2">don&#39;t want him meeting with the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.850" end="00:03:06.260" style="s2">leader because look at that craziness</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.530" end="00:03:10.220" style="s2">and they still haven&#39;t gotten that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.260" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">can easily shift from you know shifts</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.220" end="00:03:14.330" style="s2">his modes he just just into whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.550" style="s2">mode the situation requires yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.330" end="00:03:18.709" style="s2">a I think code-switching is another way</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.550" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">of saying that it&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.709" end="00:03:23.239" style="s2">specific to linguistics and and just</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">your your overall communication style</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.239" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is by for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">working in my schools were 99%</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:33.860" style="s2">african-american and so in the classes</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:35.989" style="s2">there you&#39;ve got the kids speaking sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.860" end="00:03:37.700" style="s2">of colloquial you know I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.989" end="00:03:39.140" style="s2">Ebonics isn&#39;t the right word I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.700" end="00:03:40.970" style="s2">even know what they call it black black</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.140" end="00:03:43.160" style="s2">English or something but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.970" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">colloquial version and so actually the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.160" end="00:03:46.130" style="s2">teacher specifically say listen when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:48.290" style="s2">when you&#39;re in school or with your</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.130" end="00:03:49.430" style="s2">friends you can speak like this but when</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.290" end="00:03:51.110" style="s2">you give a presentation you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.430" end="00:03:52.310" style="s2">speak like this and when you go and meet</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.110" end="00:03:53.570" style="s2">somebody professionally you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.310" end="00:03:56.630" style="s2">speak like this so they&#39;re very well</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.570" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">versed in this code-switching idea so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.630" end="00:04:01.190" style="s2">remember when aoc cortez she went and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:02.989" style="s2">spoke at like an all black congregation</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.190" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">or something and like dipped into some</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.989" end="00:04:06.590" style="s2">colloquial sort of african american</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:09.650" style="s2">style communication and she just got</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.590" end="00:04:11.030" style="s2">completely slammed for that and to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.650" end="00:04:13.250" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking no that&#39;s perfectly natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.030" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">you meet and match and miR the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.250" end="00:04:17.630" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking to so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:20.260" style="s2">gain credibility and persuasiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.630" end="00:04:22.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not an in-out and off</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.260" end="00:04:24.220" style="s2">big thing to do so this ties all</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.600" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">together with an another question which</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:28.210" style="s2">is I have learned and studied all of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:30.520" style="s2">know see all Dini and all the persuasion</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.210" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">stuff and Dan Kennedy and copywriting</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.520" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">and everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:38.230" style="s2">am I being inauthentic when I utilize</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">those techniques is it just me is there</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.230" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">a shadiness to them is there is there</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:45.370" style="s2">are these weapons that can be used in</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:48.310" style="s2">the wrong hands is there nefariousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.370" end="00:04:51.220" style="s2">can good people use persuasion morally</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.310" end="00:04:53.170" style="s2">and ethically well the first thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.220" end="00:04:54.640" style="s2">say is that we&#39;re all persuading all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.170" end="00:04:57.010" style="s2">time it&#39;s just that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.640" end="00:04:59.320" style="s2">necessarily good at it so when you dress</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.010" end="00:05:01.750" style="s2">a certain way you know hold your posture</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.320" end="00:05:03.790" style="s2">a certain way use certain words with</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.750" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">people everybody is trying to persuade</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.790" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">even if all they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">persuade people that they&#39;re cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.250" style="s2">persuade people that they&#39;re covenant to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:13.810" style="s2">persuade people that they&#39;re capable so</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.250" end="00:05:15.910" style="s2">we&#39;re persuading all the time it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.810" end="00:05:18.220" style="s2">some people are better at it so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.910" end="00:05:20.680" style="s2">know if if there&#39;s any kind of moral</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.220" end="00:05:22.600" style="s2">line we&#39;re simply being good at what</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.680" end="00:05:23.920" style="s2">everybody&#39;s doing and everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.600" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it there&#39;s no it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:31.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t see that as being ethically or</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.750" end="00:05:32.770" style="s2">morally inappropriate to be better at</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.240" end="00:05:37.920" style="s2">the thing that everybody&#39;s doing and</p>
