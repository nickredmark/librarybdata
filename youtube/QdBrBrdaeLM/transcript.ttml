<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:22.439" style="s2">to my family doctor when I googled the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.029" style="s2">symptoms in my laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">it said brain tumor and it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.029" end="00:00:26.970" style="s2">might have a brain tumor and I went to</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">to the emergency room and basically made</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">them give me a cat scan they acted like</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.840" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">knife having my actual surgery which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">like a 12-hour process it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">profound experience getting diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">with brain tumors</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">both because of the community support</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">the amount of like my friends in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">laboratory and in school and my old</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:35.790" style="s2">and came to visit me in the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.869" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">after it and invited me out to do things</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.790" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">and I was more likely to say yes and go</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">out and do things cuz I didn&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.070" style="s2">mean when you&#39;re 25 to hear you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">having brain surgery you think death or</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.070" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">permanent dismemberment and like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">worst thing I could think of was losing</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">my hair and not being able to smile and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">having half my face not work which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">one of the common symptoms having had</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">this surgery it&#39;s an acoustic neuroma</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">and so then coming out of the surgery I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">was deaf in one ear my double vision</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">redirected itself the other way so I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:14.129" style="s2">worse television after but my</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">brain was relearning how to fill in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.129" end="00:02:19.769" style="s2">those holes so it wasn&#39;t gonna stay that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:21.209" style="s2">way I had to relearn balance but it got</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.769" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">worse because my brain as well they took</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.209" end="00:02:25.709" style="s2">me off of steroids and I ended up acting</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">like a two-year-old which becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.709" end="00:02:29.340" style="s2">parent gave me a lot of insight but at</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">the time it really was hard it was hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.340" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">to feel like the world is attacking me</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">with light and sound and yet I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:38.310" style="s2">even communicate my needs and people</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">needing meeting communicate my needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.310" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">repeatedly the doctors both that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:44.730" style="s2">took me off the steroids when they</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">weren&#39;t supposed to even though it made</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.730" end="00:02:50.130" style="s2">sense medically but also going to my</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:51.660" style="s2">family doctor in a state of my brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.130" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">swell you know her not recognizing it</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.069" end="00:04:36.849" style="s2">getting surgery which is like 12 hours</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.900" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">long or I could get radiation and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.849" end="00:04:41.979" style="s2">really didn&#39;t want to have radiation but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:44.440" style="s2">it was the only option and as much as</p>
