<p begin="00:00:04.569" end="00:00:08.690" style="s2">I&#39;m really looking forward to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.439" end="00:00:10.100" style="s2">conversation just thought I&#39;d give a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.690" end="00:00:12.530" style="s2">little bit of background and maybe play</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.100" end="00:00:15.470" style="s2">a little clip from an interview I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.530" end="00:00:17.650" style="s2">we did Jonathan over a year ago now</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.470" end="00:00:20.330" style="s2">where we were talking about the initial</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.650" end="00:00:21.800" style="s2">Jordan Peterson sam harris debate and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.330" end="00:00:24.500" style="s2">you made a really fascinating point</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.800" end="00:00:26.869" style="s2">about the phenomenology of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.500" end="00:00:29.119" style="s2">and I think I talked to Jordan about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.869" end="00:00:31.340" style="s2">very soon afterwards and we like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.119" end="00:00:33.710" style="s2">seed was sown back then about maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.340" end="00:00:37.609" style="s2">having a dialogue around this this wider</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.710" end="00:00:39.260" style="s2">topic of consciousness and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.609" end="00:00:41.569" style="s2">place that Jordan Peterson and Sam</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.260" end="00:00:43.879" style="s2">Harris got stuck that could be the place</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.569" end="00:00:46.429" style="s2">with its most fruitful to explore so</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.879" end="00:00:47.749" style="s2">I&#39;ll just play that quick clip now if I</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.429" end="00:00:49.999" style="s2">had a discussion with Sam Harris I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.749" end="00:00:52.309" style="s2">just say okay look I know you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.999" end="00:00:53.539" style="s2">religion I&#39;m religious that&#39;s fine let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.309" end="00:00:55.339" style="s2">not talk about that cuz gonna be a dead</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.539" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">end let&#39;s talk about consciousness let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.339" end="00:01:00.199" style="s2">talk about that and let&#39;s lay it out</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:03.019" style="s2">okay what does a world in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.199" end="00:01:06.020" style="s2">consciousness is central how does it lay</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.019" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">itself out how does attention lay itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.020" end="00:01:09.980" style="s2">out right it lays itself out in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:11.690" style="s2">hierarchies terms of hierarchies you</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.980" end="00:01:14.090" style="s2">have a point of attention and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.690" end="00:01:16.130" style="s2">around that point lay the world kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.090" end="00:01:18.770" style="s2">flows out into chaos which is on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.130" end="00:01:20.450" style="s2">edge even in your visual frame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.770" end="00:01:22.310" style="s2">how it works right so you have points of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.450" end="00:01:24.200" style="s2">attention and then on the edges you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.310" end="00:01:26.480" style="s2">this chaotic space which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.200" end="00:01:29.450" style="s2">kind of gray and not totally there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.480" end="00:01:31.220" style="s2">so you say okay so now let&#39;s take that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.450" end="00:01:33.470" style="s2">experience of consciousness and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.220" end="00:01:34.730" style="s2">say that that&#39;s the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.470" end="00:01:36.350" style="s2">reality that&#39;s what he says he says</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.730" end="00:01:39.430" style="s2">that&#39;s the foundation of reality well is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.350" end="00:01:42.380" style="s2">there an analog to that in a community</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.430" end="00:01:43.790" style="s2">what does that look like what does a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.380" end="00:01:45.650" style="s2">commute what does the analog of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.790" end="00:01:49.130" style="s2">consciousness in a community look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.650" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">it looks like it looks like gathering</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.130" end="00:01:53.390" style="s2">together around a point</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:56.150" style="s2">looks like turning around appointed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.390" end="00:01:58.970" style="s2">it&#39;s circumambulation it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.150" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a hierarchy of social of structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.970" end="00:02:03.170" style="s2">and it ends up looking like a religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:06.350" style="s2">ritual that&#39;s what it looks like right</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.170" end="00:02:08.119" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s religious rituals</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.350" end="00:02:09.829" style="s2">are have the same structure as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.119" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">structure of consciousness so I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.829" end="00:02:13.459" style="s2">that that and then how does what does</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:14.750" style="s2">that look like in time what does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.459" end="00:02:16.460" style="s2">experience of consciousness to look</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">like if you see it with the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.460" end="00:02:23.240" style="s2">time and what it looks like is a story</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:25.100" style="s2">do you guys feel this like that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.240" end="00:02:27.020" style="s2">point the phenomenology of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.100" end="00:02:27.980" style="s2">like what the consciousness looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.020" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">story is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.980" end="00:02:32.360" style="s2">mase that could unstick this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">conversation or how do you want to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.360" end="00:02:37.970" style="s2">the what I mean not to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:39.380" style="s2">instantaneously hyper meta but the very</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.970" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">first thing that happens is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.380" end="00:02:42.170" style="s2">that we&#39;re even conscious of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:45.080" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about epistemology as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.170" end="00:02:46.520" style="s2">a thing I think that&#39;s already a piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.080" end="00:02:48.920" style="s2">of bone sticking the conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.520" end="00:02:50.930" style="s2">actually having awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.920" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">underlying basis that gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.930" end="00:02:54.890" style="s2">constructs that we happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:57.050" style="s2">operating in and just being willing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.890" end="00:03:00.650" style="s2">go down that stack as far as need to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.050" end="00:03:03.980" style="s2">so so that we don&#39;t get stuck on things</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">that at least now in the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.980" end="00:03:07.670" style="s2">world we didn&#39;t used to have in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:11.420" style="s2">principle the capacity to have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.670" end="00:03:14.209" style="s2">facility with so that was my the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.420" end="00:03:16.010" style="s2">that got that I actually felt stalked by</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.209" end="00:03:18.290" style="s2">almost like choking on a bone when</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.010" end="00:03:22.040" style="s2">listening to that conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.290" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">Jordan and Sam was the fact of kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.040" end="00:03:26.030" style="s2">system illogical is just zooming past</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">each other right and the inability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.030" end="00:03:30.709" style="s2">look at and say oh wait a minute we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:35.989" style="s2">actually instantiating orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.709" end="00:03:37.970" style="s2">epistemologies and there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.989" end="00:03:41.900" style="s2">basis to actually establish one as being</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.970" end="00:03:43.160" style="s2">the dominant epistemology so that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.900" end="00:03:45.079" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of done there&#39;s no not off</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.160" end="00:03:46.040" style="s2">you can see like what do you do in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.079" end="00:03:47.299" style="s2">context that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:49.910" style="s2">conversation what didn&#39;t doing her in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.299" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">that situation and exploring it but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.910" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">felt like there there wasn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.350" style="s2">the ability kind of step one level</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.390" style="s2">higher or deeper Tiffany in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.350" end="00:03:58.970" style="s2">preferred metaphor and have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.390" end="00:04:00.739" style="s2">conversation one of the things that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.970" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">terms of sam harris we&#39;re going to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.739" end="00:04:07.630" style="s2">with that conversation that i find</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">fascinating is that to certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.630" end="00:04:11.420" style="s2">jordan Peterson talks about</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">consciousness talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.420" end="00:04:15.799" style="s2">phenomenology of consciousness quite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:19.609" style="s2">bit and Sam talks about it as well in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.799" end="00:04:21.650" style="s2">terms of in terms of the basis of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.609" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">world that is he really has this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.650" end="00:04:26.180" style="s2">meditative practice he has this</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">connection to Eastern practices and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.180" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">he has had mystical</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:31.430" style="s2">it seems at least it&#39;s what he said he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:32.600" style="s2">he seems to say that he has had some</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.430" end="00:04:35.000" style="s2">mystical experiences where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.600" end="00:04:37.790" style="s2">experienced his the bareness of his</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.000" end="00:04:39.650" style="s2">consciousness as this point kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.790" end="00:04:42.590" style="s2">point of origin out of which the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.650" end="00:04:46.070" style="s2">kind of lays itself out or comes comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.590" end="00:04:48.260" style="s2">towards we could say and so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.070" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">fascinates me is that he has that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.260" end="00:04:53.450" style="s2">experience he has that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:55.820" style="s2">let&#39;s say of the basic of the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.450" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">all our experience of being this first</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.820" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">person looking around and experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:05.660" style="s2">the world but he then jumps from that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">point to science and so he says here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.660" end="00:05:10.100" style="s2">the basis of existence that is this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">the only thing almost that we can say is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.100" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">real and then he goes from there to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">analytic mode which is that which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">actually an alienated mode where you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:20.900" style="s2">have to make the effort of alienating</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:22.940" style="s2">yourself from your first-person</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.900" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">perspective and looking at the world in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.940" end="00:05:28.220" style="s2">this flat way whereas if to meet you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:31.130" style="s2">with five finest ranges that you if he</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.220" end="00:05:33.669" style="s2">was able to understand how taking that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.130" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">point of consciousness as the origin if</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.669" end="00:05:38.480" style="s2">you follow the steps and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:42.050" style="s2">understand that these consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.480" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say come together and stack up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.050" end="00:05:47.270" style="s2">that&#39;s how you build families that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:48.830" style="s2">you build larger units or you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.270" end="00:05:50.180" style="s2">you build these distributed</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.830" end="00:05:52.690" style="s2">consciousness is whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.180" end="00:05:55.640" style="s2">call it you know cities countries</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.690" end="00:05:58.030" style="s2">identities that are larger than person</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.640" end="00:06:00.530" style="s2">and that the way that within yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.030" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">you function the way you have parts and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.530" end="00:06:04.760" style="s2">that those parts interact is the same as</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:06.770" style="s2">how that happens at higher scale and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.760" end="00:06:09.140" style="s2">that that&#39;s the same thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.770" end="00:06:12.919" style="s2">in a story that&#39;s how we create images</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.140" end="00:06:15.950" style="s2">all of these human all of the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.919" end="00:06:18.620" style="s2">human culture and human wisdom is there</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.950" end="00:06:20.330" style="s2">and religion is part of it so if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.620" end="00:06:23.150" style="s2">look at religious practice you would see</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.330" end="00:06:24.590" style="s2">that procession processing having sacred</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.150" end="00:06:27.950" style="s2">spaces where everybody gathers together</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.590" end="00:06:31.130" style="s2">and acts in the same manner speaks the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.950" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">same words or sometimes it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.130" end="00:06:35.630" style="s2">rhythm in that speaking there can be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.830" end="00:06:38.660" style="s2">back and forth between two sides and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.630" end="00:06:42.050" style="s2">there can be a processing all of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.660" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">actions make a lot more sense if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.050" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">standing through the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.550" end="00:06:47.750" style="s2">consciousness but if you then jump to an</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">analytic mode where you analyze</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.750" end="00:06:51.349" style="s2">everything flat in terms of its atoms</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">and its molecules and everything then</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.349" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">you look at the phenomena of religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:59.330" style="s2">and you think it&#39;s it&#39;s idiotic because</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:01.789" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t fit it doesn&#39;t fit that way</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.330" end="00:07:03.620" style="s2">it fits through the through that other</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.789" end="00:07:06.110" style="s2">side so I don&#39;t understand how he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.620" end="00:07:09.110" style="s2">able to like there&#39;s a weird blindness</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.110" end="00:07:10.430" style="s2">in his in his approach to reality where</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.110" end="00:07:12.710" style="s2">he jumps from one to the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.430" end="00:07:14.840" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t he&#39;s not able to make the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.710" end="00:07:18.139" style="s2">it&#39;s not able to draw the line in order</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">to to get there I don&#39;t understand to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.139" end="00:07:21.590" style="s2">interject here before you start Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:22.849" style="s2">just because I&#39;m what I&#39;m hearing when</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.590" end="00:07:25.909" style="s2">Jonathan says that and I&#39;d not thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.849" end="00:07:27.259" style="s2">about this before is coherence like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.909" end="00:07:29.960" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about like speaking the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.259" end="00:07:32.360" style="s2">same words in a ritual together is feels</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.960" end="00:07:34.129" style="s2">like coat like coherence being primary</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.360" end="00:07:36.139" style="s2">in terms of consciousness and then a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.129" end="00:07:38.599" style="s2">shared experience of consciousness being</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.139" end="00:07:39.949" style="s2">somehow primary which just I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:41.300" style="s2">throwing that in because that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.949" end="00:07:43.669" style="s2">something we&#39;ve been talking about quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.300" end="00:07:45.500" style="s2">a bit right I get the I get the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.669" end="00:07:47.509" style="s2">like that would be in like bring that up</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.500" end="00:07:49.159" style="s2">later I feel like - like feeling it now</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.509" end="00:07:51.050" style="s2">sitting it now is great and it can</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.159" end="00:07:53.029" style="s2">percolate I think it&#39;s actually gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.050" end="00:07:55.310" style="s2">a moment I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna do this</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.029" end="00:08:03.860" style="s2">watch you ready 37 minutes from now</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.310" end="00:08:05.690" style="s2">where it&#39;ll actually be alright so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:07.729" style="s2">thing that I was noticing that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.690" end="00:08:10.819" style="s2">actually kind of peeking my curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.729" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">and felt like maybe most helpful most</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.819" end="00:08:14.690" style="s2">useful is actually should inquire into</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">into that that notion of how is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.690" end="00:08:18.590" style="s2">happening because it&#39;s it raises the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.979" style="s2">question the bait the general question</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.590" end="00:08:25.909" style="s2">is how does how does the the mode or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.979" end="00:08:28.159" style="s2">way that a given mind and by the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.909" end="00:08:34.449" style="s2">making a distinction here mine the way a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.159" end="00:08:37.909" style="s2">given mind grasps or approaches the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.449" end="00:08:40.339" style="s2">questions that that arise for it</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.909" end="00:08:41.810" style="s2">so in this case where we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.339" end="00:08:43.820" style="s2">about sam harris or at least the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.810" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">particular caricature of sam harris that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.820" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">we&#39;re playing with the sandbox and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.140" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">harris the will we now be poking at as</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:51.770" style="s2">having this interesting certainly from</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:54.459" style="s2">our perspective and by the way I share</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.770" end="00:08:54.459" style="s2">this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.550" end="00:09:00.410" style="s2">odd - characteristic of starting at</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.860" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">first person but then as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.410" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">thinking begins it immediately flips to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:07.700" style="s2">an obligate third-person perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.709" style="s2">i recomment specifically obligate third</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.700" end="00:09:11.300" style="s2">person which is to say without a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.709" end="00:09:13.130" style="s2">conscious choice like it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.300" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">unconscious almost like a structural</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:18.140" style="s2">characteristic that forces the entire</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:21.110" style="s2">awareness capacity the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.140" end="00:09:25.339" style="s2">perceive what is real into that obligate</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.110" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">point of view such that it even because</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.339" end="00:09:29.870" style="s2">of that the ability to actually be aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:32.570" style="s2">of or notice the the curiousness the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.870" end="00:09:35.390" style="s2">almost to the feeling I have a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.570" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">of like the disorienting feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.390" end="00:09:41.570" style="s2">moving from first person to third person</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:42.950" style="s2">without any step in between so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.570" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">bunch of stuff there right is about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.950" end="00:09:46.850" style="s2">notion of like the distinct which in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:49.700" style="s2">consciousness in mind the notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.850" end="00:09:52.040" style="s2">mind is and how it actually emerges how</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.700" end="00:09:53.899" style="s2">one might go about having this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.040" end="00:09:55.190" style="s2">having an obligate perspective and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.899" end="00:09:58.370" style="s2">that would happen and why it might</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.190" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">happen and even possibly thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.370" end="00:10:01.940" style="s2">it in terms of given where we are now</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:03.709" style="s2">like who we are as humans in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.940" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">the cultures that we&#39;re in and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.709" end="00:10:08.570" style="s2">things that we&#39;re facing is there a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:11.510" style="s2">for us to actually be conscious of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.570" end="00:10:15.290" style="s2">we design mind so that the mind that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.510" end="00:10:16.550" style="s2">are using to apprehend world is most</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.290" end="00:10:20.300" style="s2">suitable to the world we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.550" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">in hmm when you say design mind I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.300" end="00:10:23.899" style="s2">sure what you mean you mean by design</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">your own mind or design people&#39;s mind or</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.899" end="00:10:27.649" style="s2">design in artificial intelligence what</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:28.790" style="s2">do you mean by design mind well</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.649" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">interesting I did not think about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.790" end="00:10:31.100" style="s2">third but that definitely comes up</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.140" end="00:10:33.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.100" end="00:10:36.380" style="s2">I was initially thinking about the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.770" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2">and then as you were you know bringing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.380" end="00:10:42.130" style="s2">me to into more inquiry the question of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.500" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">parenting becomes almost immediate so</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.130" end="00:10:48.020" style="s2">one might assume that most minds are</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.850" style="s2">developmental they they are developed in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.020" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">the process of the coming in to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.850" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">becoming of a person and so whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:57.019" style="s2">we&#39;re being intentional about it or not</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:59.089" style="s2">we are contributing meaningfully to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.019" end="00:11:01.640" style="s2">mind that a given child that we happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.089" end="00:11:03.350" style="s2">to be parenting has yeah so I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.640" end="00:11:05.029" style="s2">the first and first and second feel very</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.350" end="00:11:06.589" style="s2">nice to me the third frankly is a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.029" end="00:11:07.730" style="s2">bit scary for me and I&#39;m kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.589" end="00:11:10.410" style="s2">that far</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.730" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">well in terms of in terms of a child I</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.410" end="00:11:17.550" style="s2">think that the the how can I say it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:21.290" style="s2">the best way to train a mind I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.550" end="00:11:26.610" style="s2">is loved it it&#39;s sorry to use that word</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.290" end="00:11:28.350" style="s2">everybody fine but the the idea of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.610" end="00:11:29.459" style="s2">is this is related to what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.350" end="00:11:32.910" style="s2">about in terms of the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.459" end="00:11:34.649" style="s2">consciousness stacks up or that person</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.910" end="00:11:39.089" style="s2">stacked come together in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.649" end="00:11:40.680" style="s2">communion and so the the idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.089" end="00:11:43.260" style="s2">communion is the way to train a mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.680" end="00:11:45.570" style="s2">that being in a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:50.899" style="s2">someone that&#39;s the real way to train to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.570" end="00:11:54.630" style="s2">mind that by attending you know by</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.899" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">paying attention to something by you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.630" end="00:11:59.130" style="s2">know treating them treating something</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:01.260" style="s2">feigning a child is important and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.130" end="00:12:04.529" style="s2">when you do that then you have two sides</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.260" end="00:12:07.380" style="s2">which will appear right away one is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.529" end="00:12:10.860" style="s2">side which is to encourage what is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.380" end="00:12:12.420" style="s2">is what encourages the communion and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.860" end="00:12:14.670" style="s2">then the other would be to discourage</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.420" end="00:12:16.050" style="s2">you know a right and a left hand right</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.670" end="00:12:17.940" style="s2">hand to bring closer and the left hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.050" end="00:12:22.290" style="s2">to move away and that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.940" end="00:12:23.610" style="s2">training the mind in how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:24.600" style="s2">interact with the world that is when we</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.050" end="00:12:34.589" style="s2">the one and perceiving the many when</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">you&#39;re raising up a child that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.589" end="00:12:39.560" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly doing in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:42.510" style="s2">child you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.560" end="00:12:44.550" style="s2">showing the child what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.510" end="00:12:46.200" style="s2">straight and what is crooked you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.550" end="00:12:47.640" style="s2">say and the child will have to explore</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.200" end="00:12:49.800" style="s2">what is crooked as well they&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:51.270" style="s2">you know it&#39;s part of doing it but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.800" end="00:12:53.160" style="s2">they&#39;ll also see the consequences of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.270" end="00:12:55.050" style="s2">crooked and the consequences of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.160" end="00:12:57.540" style="s2">straight all this and so to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.050" end="00:12:59.339" style="s2">how you that&#39;s how you you train a mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.540" end="00:13:01.890" style="s2">and it comes back to this idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.339" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">RIA the first reality of human people is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.890" end="00:13:07.649" style="s2">is people like we we the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.670" end="00:13:10.380" style="s2">care about is other minds other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.649" end="00:13:12.870" style="s2">that&#39;s good we care about first I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.380" end="00:13:14.820" style="s2">that make sense well there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.870" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">things that come up I mean what I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.820" end="00:13:20.370" style="s2">say is the part of my my preferred way</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:20.760" style="s2">to be in dialogue is to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.370" end="00:13:23.070" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.760" end="00:13:25.079" style="s2">so did agree to which there&#39;s a material</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.070" end="00:13:26.730" style="s2">for sense-making in front of us I feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.079" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">called the step that like step in with</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.730" end="00:13:30.420" style="s2">my I guess you&#39;re a sculptor right well</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:32.040" style="s2">for whatever reason I had a metalworking</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.420" end="00:13:34.350" style="s2">metaphor come to me so I&#39;ve got a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.040" end="00:13:35.790" style="s2">banging on the on the metal I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.350" end="00:13:38.910" style="s2">if those two don&#39;t go to whether you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.790" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">gather well what cup popped in my head</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.910" end="00:13:45.990" style="s2">was this really nice plan words which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:47.810" style="s2">attending rather than pretending because</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.990" end="00:13:51.260" style="s2">what I&#39;ve noticed is that many parents</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.810" end="00:13:55.620" style="s2">and I have meaningful experience in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.260" end="00:13:56.730" style="s2">pretend to attend and that is really</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.620" end="00:13:58.170" style="s2">problematic and this I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.730" end="00:13:59.970" style="s2">characteristic of a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.170" end="00:14:01.410" style="s2">mind so we now have an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.970" end="00:14:03.540" style="s2">feedback loop which is that first</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.410" end="00:14:06.089" style="s2">question how do you actually shift your</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.540" end="00:14:08.040" style="s2">own mind so that a habit of pretending</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.089" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">is actually able to be replaced by an</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.040" end="00:14:12.570" style="s2">actual lived attending which then gives</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:14.190" style="s2">rise to the possibility of then that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.570" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">relationship with your child that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.190" end="00:14:20.190" style="s2">identified as perhaps being the way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:22.230" style="s2">help them develop their mind yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.190" end="00:14:25.260" style="s2">and I think I think that&#39;s when you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.230" end="00:14:27.750" style="s2">practice is like practicing attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.260" end="00:14:30.329" style="s2">itself in in the in the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.750" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">mystical tradition you have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.329" end="00:14:35.779" style="s2">that there&#39;s a tension and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">memory you always have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.779" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">remember yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:41.910" style="s2">the idea is remembering God and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:43.889" style="s2">remembering death you could say</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.910" end="00:14:45.620" style="s2">remembering the two extremes and when</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.889" end="00:14:48.449" style="s2">you do that then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.620" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">it&#39;s dip it&#39;s you don&#39;t get distracted</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.449" end="00:14:53.459" style="s2">you&#39;re well we end up it happens anyways</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:55.529" style="s2">but it&#39;s like if you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.459" end="00:14:58.440" style="s2">keeping attention and keeping memory in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.529" end="00:15:00.540" style="s2">the sense of remembering not remembering</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.440" end="00:15:01.740" style="s2">the things in the past but remembering</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.540" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">the sense of staying connected to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.740" end="00:15:05.970" style="s2">staying connected to some three memory</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.490" style="s2">yeah exactly so it&#39;s like you you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.970" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">this state of attention in memory and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.490" end="00:15:15.300" style="s2">then you it&#39;s more difficult but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:17.459" style="s2">then you won&#39;t pretend or if you do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.300" end="00:15:19.410" style="s2">it&#39;ll be malicious if you do it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.459" end="00:15:21.029" style="s2">again won&#39;t it will be even worse see if</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.410" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">you if you if you pretend when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.029" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">attending because it&#39;ll almost be</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:28.740" style="s2">immoral because you you&#39;ll be doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:30.630" style="s2">out of yeah yes I would say be profane</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.740" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">yeah because when if you well usually</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.630" end="00:15:34.200" style="s2">we&#39;re distracted that&#39;s why we pretend</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:36.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why we don&#39;t attend to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.200" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">children because it&#39;s like we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.120" end="00:15:38.700" style="s2">with our children but we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:41.100" style="s2">about our job we think about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.700" end="00:15:43.200" style="s2">other problem some stupid thing someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.100" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">said on Facebook or whatever and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.200" end="00:15:49.800" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not there and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:52.410" style="s2">but I do think that being there like</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.800" end="00:15:54.570" style="s2">giving a child attention for like 10</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.410" end="00:15:57.720" style="s2">minutes like actual real attention I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.570" end="00:16:00.660" style="s2">mean you can feed a child yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.720" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">child like actual real attention I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.660" end="00:16:04.860" style="s2">noticed that if I can do that with my</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:06.630" style="s2">kids like 10 minutes a day they&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.860" end="00:16:07.950" style="s2">then after that it&#39;s like everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.630" end="00:16:11.160" style="s2">kinda is together but if I can just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.950" end="00:16:14.280" style="s2">focus for 10 minutes then real real</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.160" end="00:16:15.540" style="s2">attention then they know that that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.280" end="00:16:20.610" style="s2">care and they know that they&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.540" end="00:16:25.050" style="s2">this family well here I flag violating</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.610" end="00:16:26.850" style="s2">my own principal coherence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.050" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">something there so just to kind of make</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.850" end="00:16:33.480" style="s2">the the ding or the sound of the tone in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:35.640" style="s2">the in the the ether it was something</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.480" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">that there&#39;s a few things oh I was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.640" end="00:16:41.780" style="s2">reading with my wife rereading Dan</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:44.610" style="s2">Siegel&#39;s book on the whole brainchild</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.780" end="00:16:45.630" style="s2">one of our we have a 11 month old mother</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.610" end="00:16:47.010" style="s2">now yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.630" end="00:16:49.110" style="s2">and one of the commitments that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.010" end="00:16:51.270" style="s2">made we actually went through a program</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.110" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">called parenting a spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.270" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">twice that&#39;s produced by some some</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:16:59.730" style="s2">Canadians and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:01.260" style="s2">came out of that was an introduction of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.730" end="00:17:03.450" style="s2">Dance Eagles working with you know made</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.260" end="00:17:05.310" style="s2">a commitment to reread that periodically</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.450" end="00:17:06.930" style="s2">just to kind of keep the his good</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.310" end="00:17:09.060" style="s2">heuristics don&#39;t you know his work but</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.930" end="00:17:12.329" style="s2">they&#39;re very good concrete like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.060" end="00:17:13.260" style="s2">ways to deal with being in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.329" end="00:17:15.089" style="s2">with the child&#39;s mind and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.260" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">distinctions he makes is between</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.089" end="00:17:21.150" style="s2">implicit and explicit memory and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:22.500" style="s2">that was a there was an interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:23.880" style="s2">not a it&#39;s not a mapping I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.500" end="00:17:27.900" style="s2">actually implying that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.880" end="00:17:29.370" style="s2">you were saying between a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.900" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">remember there&#39;s like remembering things</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.370" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">that are in the past and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.690" end="00:17:35.810" style="s2">remember that was a coming together but</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:39.900" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting connection like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.810" end="00:17:42.840" style="s2">like a tonal resonance between implicit</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.900" end="00:17:43.680" style="s2">and explicit so explicit memory is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.840" end="00:17:44.700" style="s2">you were talking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.680" end="00:17:45.930" style="s2">remembering things in the past so</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.700" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">remember a few minutes ago when David</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.930" end="00:17:49.500" style="s2">said that thing that&#39;s exclusive memory</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:51.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting to even feel what</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.500" end="00:17:52.710" style="s2">it feels like to be in that mode of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.000" end="00:17:55.470" style="s2">explicit memory looks like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.710" end="00:17:58.290" style="s2">the theatres of mine metaphor implicit</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.470" end="00:18:00.390" style="s2">memory is the thing like you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.290" end="00:18:02.310" style="s2">you ride a bike there&#39;s a process you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.390" end="00:18:04.620" style="s2">learned how to ride a bike and you built</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.310" end="00:18:06.540" style="s2">it into your body you embodied the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.620" end="00:18:08.790" style="s2">capacity to ride a bike and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.540" end="00:18:11.610" style="s2">there&#39;s something very consonant between</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.790" end="00:18:15.090" style="s2">that the two to embody the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.610" end="00:18:17.070" style="s2">live in continuity with life is I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:18.690" style="s2">very close to what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.070" end="00:18:20.490" style="s2">so yeah whoo the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.690" end="00:18:22.860" style="s2">have been healthy you&#39;ve actually become</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.490" end="00:18:25.740" style="s2">whole in yourself so there&#39;s nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.860" end="00:18:28.560" style="s2">you this between you and and the life</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.740" end="00:18:30.210" style="s2">that you&#39;re in relationship with then to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.560" end="00:18:33.240" style="s2">be remembered would be to bring yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.210" end="00:18:34.770" style="s2">back to bring your implicit memory yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.240" end="00:18:36.180" style="s2">to tune your implicit memories so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.770" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">your implicit memory makes it not</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.180" end="00:18:39.680" style="s2">possible for you to be present to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.570" style="s2">moment fully</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.680" end="00:18:44.580" style="s2">I think that in terms of tons of kids</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.570" end="00:18:47.250" style="s2">you can see I can see it because we did</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.580" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">we homeschooled our kids and now my</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.250" end="00:18:52.650" style="s2">daughter she decided to go to school</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:54.600" style="s2">she&#39;s 12 and we&#39;re really nervous at</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.650" end="00:18:55.650" style="s2">first because obviously a home school is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.600" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">different you know just the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:18:59.820" style="s2">approach and it&#39;s more holistic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:02.520" style="s2">more about people and relationships you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.820" end="00:19:05.490" style="s2">know and giving the giving the kid time</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.520" end="00:19:07.080" style="s2">to be really bored you know so that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.490" end="00:19:08.550" style="s2">thinking about stuff and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.080" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">my son picked up the pianos cause he was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.550" end="00:19:11.910" style="s2">so bored and he started playing three</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">hours a day and we&#39;re like you know it</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.910" end="00:19:17.370" style="s2">works but we were a little afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:19.710" style="s2">academic part because you know we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.370" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">hammer on that as much and so our</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.710" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2">daughter went to school and she did</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:24.570" style="s2">totally fine</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.740" end="00:19:26.460" style="s2">like she&#39;s completely fine you know she</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.570" end="00:19:28.650" style="s2">has she has she has good grades she</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.460" end="00:19:29.970" style="s2">she&#39;s doing well and what I realized is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.650" end="00:19:32.040" style="s2">it has something to do with what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.970" end="00:19:34.680" style="s2">were talking about in terms of I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.040" end="00:19:36.540" style="s2">that what we gave her in homeschool was</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.680" end="00:19:39.300" style="s2">not so much a bunch of stuff to learn</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.540" end="00:19:42.450" style="s2">but rather a way of being and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.300" end="00:19:44.070" style="s2">learning that that&#39;s so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.450" end="00:19:46.800" style="s2">implicit parts like she knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.070" end="00:19:48.030" style="s2">learn she knows how to be and so put her</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.800" end="00:19:50.580" style="s2">in any circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.030" end="00:19:52.440" style="s2">she&#39;ll be fine like she she might not</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.580" end="00:19:54.810" style="s2">even if she doesn&#39;t know something she</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.440" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">knows how to to be quiet and to listen</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.810" end="00:20:00.540" style="s2">and to catch the right pattern and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:01.500" style="s2">to to to quickly catch up because she</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.540" end="00:20:03.510" style="s2">can learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.500" end="00:20:05.130" style="s2">and I was like oh okay so that I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.510" end="00:20:08.040" style="s2">like okay now I know why we homeschool</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.130" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">you know like I understand what the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.040" end="00:20:12.540" style="s2">advantage was it was really giving them</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.850" style="s2">teaching them to your person first and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.540" end="00:20:15.840" style="s2">then you know after that you can slit</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.850" end="00:20:18.180" style="s2">them loose and they&#39;ll do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:20.280" style="s2">they&#39;ll be fine you know yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.180" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of cool things that like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.280" end="00:20:25.770" style="s2">branches that are popping off as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:27.720" style="s2">conversation is opening up the one that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.770" end="00:20:29.190" style="s2">I think has the most it feels to me like</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.720" end="00:20:32.490" style="s2">grit right now has the most relevance</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.190" end="00:20:35.040" style="s2">was going back to the moment where the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.490" end="00:20:37.170" style="s2">parent is attending the child and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.040" end="00:20:39.300" style="s2">way that the child has a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.170" end="00:20:40.590" style="s2">with with another person in this case</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.300" end="00:20:43.740" style="s2">that would me even in book with another</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.590" end="00:20:44.790" style="s2">consciousness and then thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.740" end="00:20:46.950" style="s2">because you actually made a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.790" end="00:20:51.030" style="s2">specific reference and I&#39;d like to to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.950" end="00:20:53.820" style="s2">bring it out to the or what&#39;s Eminem I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.030" end="00:20:56.370" style="s2">gonna do a twist so as inside so outside</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.820" end="00:20:58.650" style="s2">or as outside so inside there the notion</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.370" end="00:21:00.270" style="s2">of the the first thing the child is in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.650" end="00:21:03.150" style="s2">relationship with is their own interior</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.270" end="00:21:04.680" style="s2">there&#39;s there the quality of the the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.150" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">that they themselves are showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.680" end="00:21:09.390" style="s2">life of course as a child at the end</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:11.820" style="s2">unit for newborn the distinction is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.390" end="00:21:13.950" style="s2">a distinction so even the process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.820" end="00:21:16.590" style="s2">actually being able to sense the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.950" end="00:21:20.060" style="s2">difference between what is them and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.590" end="00:21:23.850" style="s2">is mom for example it is the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.060" end="00:21:25.770" style="s2">and so in a very lived way one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.850" end="00:21:27.090" style="s2">very first practices that we were that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.770" end="00:21:29.970" style="s2">we practiced my wife and I with our</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.090" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">infant this came from the that program</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.970" end="00:21:38.280" style="s2">that I mentioned was before we would</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:41.130" style="s2">pick her up or before we would give</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.280" end="00:21:43.140" style="s2">allow anyone else to hold her we would</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.130" end="00:21:45.960" style="s2">just you know create a structure like</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.140" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">this your hands open and then give her</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.960" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">the time which has a I&#39;m not a newborn</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:53.490" style="s2">but within two or three weeks it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">actually began to land to sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.490" end="00:21:56.820" style="s2">something was that there was a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:21:59.480" style="s2">possibility of relationship and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.820" end="00:22:01.560" style="s2">gets to be held and then to signal</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.480" end="00:22:04.440" style="s2">whether or not that possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.560" end="00:22:06.990" style="s2">relationship was consented to because</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.440" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a yes and the point there is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.990" end="00:22:12.840" style="s2">actually create a feeling of in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:14.310" style="s2">interior of the child the experience the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.840" end="00:22:14.800" style="s2">implicit experience but nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.310" end="00:22:16.030" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.800" end="00:22:19.660" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious that we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.030" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">one-month-old but the implicit like how</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.660" end="00:22:23.290" style="s2">do I say this without a well that&#39;ll of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:25.960" style="s2">noise do a lot of clarity of signal of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.290" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">what does it feel like in me when</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.960" end="00:22:31.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a feeling of yes to something</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:32.770" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve noticed that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.330" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">been part of a stack that there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.770" end="00:22:38.520" style="s2">building at that that because she has an</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:44.200" style="s2">ability to sense in herself when she is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.520" end="00:22:46.300" style="s2">would you say closer to or the you had</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.200" end="00:22:49.000" style="s2">some terms like the many in this and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.300" end="00:22:51.130" style="s2">single yeah one of the many and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.000" end="00:22:53.230" style="s2">straight and the crooked right yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.130" end="00:22:55.510" style="s2">actually in herself like okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.230" end="00:22:56.860" style="s2">a six that ah okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:23:00.370" style="s2">it&#39;s that first person third person</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.860" end="00:23:02.590" style="s2">distinction you know not that&#39;s crooked</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.370" end="00:23:04.540" style="s2">that straight third person top-down</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.590" end="00:23:07.000" style="s2">visual can you tell the pattern but</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.540" end="00:23:08.650" style="s2">rather as you&#39;re looking at straight and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.000" end="00:23:10.060" style="s2">crooked are you always able to feel in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.650" end="00:23:11.500" style="s2">yourself what yourself is actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.060" end="00:23:14.050" style="s2">telling you how to make that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.500" end="00:23:15.730" style="s2">what&#39;s that distinction feel like in you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.050" end="00:23:18.610" style="s2">so that when you come across it in any</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.730" end="00:23:22.030" style="s2">context now without having to do this</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.610" end="00:23:23.080" style="s2">sort of weird semantic mapping you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.030" end="00:23:24.940" style="s2">actually will just look at and go oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.080" end="00:23:26.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve never experienced this before my</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.940" end="00:23:28.420" style="s2">life but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.380" end="00:23:29.830" style="s2">direction of straightness yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.420" end="00:23:33.220" style="s2">you don&#39;t even think it it just happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.830" end="00:23:36.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it that&#39;s why it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:37.990" style="s2">so interesting that I love so much of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.160" end="00:23:40.900" style="s2">what we are is just about being with</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.990" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">other people and it&#39;s just about and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.900" end="00:23:43.900" style="s2">mean and I say that I&#39;m on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:45.580" style="s2">I&#39;m talking and I&#39;m explaining stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.900" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">people you know so it&#39;s I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:51.580" style="s2">there&#39;s anything wrong with that but so</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:53.980" style="s2">much of what we are is just this like</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.580" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">we&#39;re communal beings when we&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.980" end="00:23:57.400" style="s2">to be together and we learn from each</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:01.480" style="s2">other and so you can kind of understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.400" end="00:24:03.850" style="s2">the idea you know of a saint or of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.480" end="00:24:06.310" style="s2">star at you know like a spiritual guide</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:08.490" style="s2">or something this notion that even just</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.310" end="00:24:10.810" style="s2">being in with someone who has attained a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.490" end="00:24:14.440" style="s2">certain more level or a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.810" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">spiritual level that can transform you</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.440" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">they can it can change you just by being</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">in contact with somebody because a lot</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.470" end="00:24:25.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not so much it&#39;s not just the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.500" end="00:24:28.750" style="s2">of getting a teaching from somebody but</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.540" end="00:24:30.760" style="s2">it is a it is somewhat how like an by me</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.750" end="00:24:32.110" style="s2">they&#39;re being and so then once you kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.760" end="00:24:33.910" style="s2">of get that you can understand why</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.110" end="00:24:36.970" style="s2">people want to go to rock concerts why</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.910" end="00:24:38.650" style="s2">people want to meet you know stars and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.970" end="00:24:40.150" style="s2">all this stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s a caricature in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.650" end="00:24:42.520" style="s2">a way it&#39;s not a caricature it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.150" end="00:24:44.590" style="s2">actual thing but it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.520" end="00:24:46.450" style="s2">little bit debased version of the desire</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.590" end="00:24:48.700" style="s2">to be with holy people or to be with</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.380" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">this person is there&#39;s there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.800" end="00:24:58.360" style="s2">just I mean I would say that I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:00.280" style="s2">that seeing would have ended when</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.360" end="00:25:02.110" style="s2">Peterson to me I saw something of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.280" end="00:25:03.550" style="s2">where it was it was like because he</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.110" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really sometimes he wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.550" end="00:25:07.000" style="s2">saying much like or he keeps repeating</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:08.830" style="s2">the same things obviously you know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.000" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">mean I sure you&#39;ve done a thousand shows</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.830" end="00:25:12.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you&#39;re obviously repeating</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:13.930" style="s2">you have to repeat yourself you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.370" end="00:25:16.510" style="s2">just be always saying new things and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.930" end="00:25:19.480" style="s2">and then people just want to be there in</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.510" end="00:25:21.790" style="s2">the room and be in the room where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.480" end="00:25:23.220" style="s2">saying the same thing that he said you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.790" end="00:25:26.260" style="s2">know ten times on his YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.220" end="00:25:29.650" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like that&#39;s when you realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:31.390" style="s2">just how much so much of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.650" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">so much of who we are is just about</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.390" end="00:25:36.070" style="s2">that&#39;s why I use the word love because</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:37.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about this actual connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.070" end="00:25:40.990" style="s2">with somebody it&#39;s it&#39;s more than just</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.770" end="00:25:43.150" style="s2">propositional oh nice you invoked it I</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.990" end="00:25:46.500" style="s2">was that wondering like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:49.330" style="s2">propositional down to participatory yak</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.500" end="00:25:50.770" style="s2">that uh and by the way I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.330" end="00:25:51.940" style="s2">keep calling him Johnny because I hope</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.770" end="00:25:55.020" style="s2">that it enters into the common</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.940" end="00:25:55.020" style="s2">vernacular right</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">the journey be brought like I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:01.720" style="s2">have that those concepts before I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:04.180" style="s2">watched his stuff and I feel like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.720" end="00:26:05.800" style="s2">just a really nice concrete but</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.180" end="00:26:06.940" style="s2">fundamental way of just helping</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.800" end="00:26:10.840" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s just such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.940" end="00:26:12.520" style="s2">distinction yeah and and yeah I myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.840" end="00:26:15.970" style="s2">have personally had the experience many</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.520" end="00:26:20.230" style="s2">times just have been biting another</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.970" end="00:26:21.400" style="s2">person and noticing by the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.230" end="00:26:22.900" style="s2">know if you&#39;re in a particular moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.400" end="00:26:25.090" style="s2">and you&#39;re having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.900" end="00:26:26.710" style="s2">someone the thing that is happening at</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.090" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">the propositional level while it may or</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.710" end="00:26:30.460" style="s2">may not be the intention like right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:32.860" style="s2">like the conversation that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.460" end="00:26:34.870" style="s2">explicitly at the propositional level is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.860" end="00:26:37.210" style="s2">almost certainly the least important</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:39.910" style="s2">thing that&#39;s actually happening there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.210" end="00:26:42.530" style="s2">a lot more going on and if and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.910" end="00:26:44.120" style="s2">noticed if I like watch the comments</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.530" end="00:26:46.250" style="s2">by the obviously right everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.120" end="00:26:47.570" style="s2">watching something reading something or</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.250" end="00:26:53.510" style="s2">participating in something is absorbing</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.570" end="00:26:55.280" style="s2">the piece that is most imbibe Abul by</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.510" end="00:26:56.780" style="s2">them its Forge they have the most thirst</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.280" end="00:26:59.510" style="s2">and to which they have the most taste</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.780" end="00:27:02.150" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been watching the John verb</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.510" end="00:27:05.150" style="s2">achy stuff quite a bit so maybe I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.150" end="00:27:06.050" style="s2">liked it to think about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.150" end="00:27:07.190" style="s2">things that he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.050" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">especially if you just talked with them</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.190" end="00:27:11.270" style="s2">I&#39;m probably going to be doing more</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:14.030" style="s2">discussion with him maybe an event even</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.270" end="00:27:15.800" style="s2">here in Canada so it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.030" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about quite a bit I</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.800" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">really appreciate the language that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.620" end="00:27:25.610" style="s2">giving in terms of and I think he really</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:27.260" style="s2">understands a lot of the a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.610" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">problem especially the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.260" end="00:27:31.820" style="s2">progress I don&#39;t know if he sees it that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:33.380" style="s2">way but he understands the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.820" end="00:27:34.820" style="s2">myth he doesn&#39;t understand it but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.380" end="00:27:36.650" style="s2">describing something which can help</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.820" end="00:27:39.710" style="s2">people understand why progress is so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.650" end="00:27:41.060" style="s2">problematic because it&#39;s always like</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.710" end="00:27:43.730" style="s2">you&#39;re gripping and then you&#39;re letting</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.060" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">go and so if you grip too tight then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.730" end="00:27:47.210" style="s2">let go you have to create this optic</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.340" style="s2">y&#39;all that we call this optimal grip or</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.210" end="00:27:51.620" style="s2">whatever and everything is like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.340" end="00:27:52.940" style="s2">where there&#39;s this optimal grip but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.620" end="00:27:54.530" style="s2">always changing and it&#39;s not you always</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.940" end="00:27:56.630" style="s2">have to kind of shift it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.530" end="00:27:58.430" style="s2">move it and so you&#39;ll hear politicians</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.630" end="00:28:00.470" style="s2">say things like you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.430" end="00:28:02.840" style="s2">centralize centralizing is the is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.470" end="00:28:04.730" style="s2">progress and then they&#39;ll centralized in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.840" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">the centralized will exaggerate I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.730" end="00:28:07.190" style="s2">once they&#39;ve centralized so much then</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:09.170" style="s2">they see all the downsides of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.190" end="00:28:11.930" style="s2">centralization lack of particularity</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.170" end="00:28:13.970" style="s2">lack of attention to to to particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.930" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">problem they&#39;re like no no we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.970" end="00:28:17.720" style="s2">decentralized II centralized and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:19.460" style="s2">decentralized everything and so this</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.720" end="00:28:21.290" style="s2">crit and then D centralizing is progress</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.460" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">right D centralizing his progress and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.290" end="00:28:25.820" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand that that the very</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">trade-off that you&#39;re it&#39;s always there</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.820" end="00:28:29.060" style="s2">that trade-off like if you want the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.500" end="00:28:32.150" style="s2">medical system to be completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.060" end="00:28:34.610" style="s2">centralized into one gigantic state-run</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.150" end="00:28:36.350" style="s2">thing then yeah it&#39;s gonna be efficient</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.610" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna do all that and then at some</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.350" end="00:28:39.650" style="s2">point you&#39;re gonna run into all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:42.440" style="s2">problems the particulars if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.650" end="00:28:44.060" style="s2">be centralized it&#39;s going to be dealing</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.440" end="00:28:45.530" style="s2">with everybody&#39;s local problems and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.060" end="00:28:48.230" style="s2">going to be great it&#39;s going to be super</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.530" end="00:28:50.330" style="s2">expensive and then it&#39;s also going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.230" end="00:28:52.430" style="s2">lack cohesive discussion between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.330" end="00:28:55.430" style="s2">experts like you just can&#39;t avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.430" end="00:28:56.519" style="s2">problem it&#39;s just and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.430" end="00:28:59.339" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.519" end="00:29:01.109" style="s2">why hey that&#39;s one of the reason why why</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.339" end="00:29:03.859" style="s2">progress is to me isn&#39;t illusions</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.109" end="00:29:06.239" style="s2">especially like social or moral progress</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.859" end="00:29:08.700" style="s2">it&#39;s always finding that optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.239" end="00:29:10.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a great quote by Rumi which I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.700" end="00:29:12.779" style="s2">really find beautiful he talked about I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.919" end="00:29:15.989" style="s2">won&#39;t quote it directly he talks about</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.099" end="00:29:36.809" style="s2">of existence you can&#39;t just breathe in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:38.249" style="s2">and think that you&#39;re on progressing</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.979" end="00:29:47.820" style="s2">have to breathe out and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.929" end="00:29:49.589" style="s2">that the language of this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:30:02.459" end="00:30:05.700" style="s2">efficient that somehow you think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.200" end="00:30:07.349" style="s2">you&#39;re going to solve the problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.700" end="00:30:09.149" style="s2">like no because as it becomes efficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.349" end="00:30:11.339" style="s2">then you&#39;ll have the problem the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.149" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">problem which is the problem of all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.339" end="00:30:15.690" style="s2">particular questions all the the</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.690" end="00:30:20.969" style="s2">are real and that you have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.649" end="00:30:22.769" style="s2">yeah anyways that&#39;s the stuff I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.969" end="00:30:24.959" style="s2">thinking about just because I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.769" end="00:30:29.249" style="s2">some of his podcast today and yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.959" end="00:30:30.989" style="s2">so I was like well the thing to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.249" end="00:30:33.570" style="s2">turned to there&#39;s a lot of things I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.989" end="00:30:35.070" style="s2">noticing for example I&#39;m not sure of any</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.570" end="00:30:36.690" style="s2">of this I&#39;m about to say is even vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.070" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">interesting useful but in any event it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.690" end="00:30:43.950" style="s2">where we are as you were talking I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:46.349" style="s2">noticing in in my in my mind different</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.950" end="00:30:49.349" style="s2">frameworks that were kind of loading up</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.349" end="00:30:51.329" style="s2">to potentially make sense so for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.349" end="00:30:54.929" style="s2">as you were talking about centralized</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.329" end="00:30:56.369" style="s2">and decentralized healthcare and I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.929" end="00:30:58.919" style="s2">actually I was actually loading up a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.369" end="00:31:01.709" style="s2">paradigm in graph theory and network</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.919" end="00:31:03.509" style="s2">theory that&#39;s actually able to do a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.709" end="00:31:05.190" style="s2">really good job making sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.509" end="00:31:07.289" style="s2">particular thing it&#39;s almost like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.190" end="00:31:10.410" style="s2">know as we&#39;re talking there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.289" end="00:31:13.980" style="s2">like flipping through the toolkits</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.410" end="00:31:15.570" style="s2">looking through the lenses or even maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.980" end="00:31:16.950" style="s2">the tones are the instruments like okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.570" end="00:31:20.120" style="s2">where are we are where are we where are</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.950" end="00:31:22.140" style="s2">we to be present to what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.120" end="00:31:23.190" style="s2">and I was just noticing like as I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.140" end="00:31:27.050" style="s2">sitting there was actually noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.190" end="00:31:29.400" style="s2">was building up inside of me and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.050" end="00:31:31.110" style="s2">the thing that dropped was actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.400" end="00:31:33.810" style="s2">of looping back to this question of our</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:05.160" style="s2">there&#39;s two problems one problem is if</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.540" end="00:32:06.570" style="s2">you&#39;re this all the time that&#39;s problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.160" end="00:32:08.780" style="s2">one problem two is when you&#39;ve actually</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.780" end="00:32:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a so we can&#39;t use as a metaphor now</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.400" end="00:32:14.340" style="s2">we have this funny thing where and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.170" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">have this moment we&#39;re in the very</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:33.630" style="s2">so calm so there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.160" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">there&#39;s something about and we can even</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.630" end="00:32:38.790" style="s2">say well this is sometimes obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:40.350" style="s2">the exact kind of culture that generates</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.790" end="00:32:41.180" style="s2">politicians who operate in this way</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.350" end="00:32:44.070" style="s2">because there&#39;s a co-evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.180" end="00:32:45.690" style="s2">dynamic generates individuals who have</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.070" end="00:32:47.880" style="s2">minds that operate in this way and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.690" end="00:32:48.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of really good rich stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.880" end="00:32:50.280" style="s2">that if we wanted to we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.900" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">double-click on an explore both the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.280" end="00:32:56.790" style="s2">history of how we got here the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:58.950" style="s2">parameters of why we got here in the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.790" end="00:33:01.290" style="s2">that we did and then of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.950" end="00:33:03.030" style="s2">choice that we might what might it mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.290" end="00:33:05.040" style="s2">for us to find a way out of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.030" end="00:33:06.990" style="s2">which I would say is if it stopped like</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.040" end="00:33:08.850" style="s2">the the kind of mind in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.990" end="00:33:12.090" style="s2">culture that shows up in this way has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.850" end="00:33:13.170" style="s2">lot of stuckness because you know if it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.090" end="00:33:14.610" style="s2">turns out somebody&#39;s throwing a baseball</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.170" end="00:33:16.020" style="s2">at you and having a hand that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">close you&#39;re gonna have a very hard time</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.020" end="00:33:20.400" style="s2">catching it yeah well one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">I think one of the problems I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.400" end="00:33:29.700" style="s2">got us stuck is I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:31.320" style="s2">I think that we we have accepted the to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.700" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">me we&#39;ve accepted the revolutionary idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.320" end="00:33:35.850" style="s2">like we&#39;ve accepted that culture is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:38.310" style="s2">opposite let&#39;s say that true culture is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.850" end="00:33:40.410" style="s2">oppositional then you know the artist is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.310" end="00:33:42.510" style="s2">an oppositional figure that all culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.410" end="00:33:45.060" style="s2">is there to oppose and you know the rock</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.510" end="00:33:47.400" style="s2">rock-and-roll punk rock aesthetic all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.060" end="00:33:49.470" style="s2">that is what we&#39;ve accepted and so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.400" end="00:33:51.420" style="s2">all understand the world I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.470" end="00:33:54.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not just it&#39;s not recent you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.420" end="00:33:56.160" style="s2">it&#39;s Marxism it&#39;s it&#39;s even even before</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.180" end="00:33:58.350" style="s2">Marx you know this idea of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.160" end="00:33:59.940" style="s2">radical dialectic we&#39;ve accepted the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.350" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2">idea that the world works through</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:04.760" style="s2">through through opposition and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:08.370" style="s2">because of that what happens is people</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.760" end="00:34:09.510" style="s2">will flip like people can actually flip</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.370" end="00:34:10.890" style="s2">from one to the other they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.510" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">realize that they still are always</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.890" end="00:34:15.120" style="s2">inhabiting this kind of oppositional is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:18.120" style="s2">kind of oppositional mode and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.120" end="00:34:20.160" style="s2">especially and democracy is part of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.120" end="00:34:22.080" style="s2">creates that issue too because you end</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.160" end="00:34:23.910" style="s2">up you inevitably end up having two</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.080" end="00:34:25.650" style="s2">parties and then you have it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.910" end="00:34:27.660" style="s2">u.s. is like such a picture perfect</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.650" end="00:34:30.030" style="s2">image it&#39;s like in this country just</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.660" end="00:34:32.190" style="s2">split 50-50 right down the middle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.030" end="00:34:34.200" style="s2">almost like a like a you could it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.190" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">almost like a cosmic image where if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.200" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">set up two opposites well that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:38.760" style="s2">gonna happen it&#39;s gonna sit up in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:40.380" style="s2">middle and people are gonna take one</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.760" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">side if you&#39;re gonna take the other even</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.380" end="00:34:44.550" style="s2">sometimes the size I don&#39;t even coherent</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.380" style="s2">in in themselves like if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.550" end="00:34:47.430" style="s2">positions that all the Republicans hold</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.380" end="00:34:48.930" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually totally coherent</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.430" end="00:34:50.520" style="s2">and there and the Democrats are not</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.930" end="00:34:52.140" style="s2">totally coherent but they just swallow</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.520" end="00:34:54.060" style="s2">one side and the other and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.140" end="00:34:56.460" style="s2">just it&#39;s just we have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.060" end="00:34:58.950" style="s2">fight with finally coherent is their</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.460" end="00:35:00.810" style="s2">critique of the other side yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.950" end="00:35:03.030" style="s2">actually get it the story they tell</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.810" end="00:35:04.950" style="s2">about the other side&#39;s weaknesses is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.030" end="00:35:08.250" style="s2">most coherent part of their platform</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.950" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">yeah and so I mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.250" end="00:35:13.560" style="s2">very dangerous is definitely a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:14.850" style="s2">dangerous way the ancient way was</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.560" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">dangerous too in a different way because</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.850" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">usually coherence would be on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:21.120" style="s2">and the opposition will be on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:23.220" style="s2">outside so you know you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.120" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">the Roman Empire and if you&#39;re Roman and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.220" end="00:35:26.820" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re if you&#39;re an actual</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:28.590" style="s2">Roman citizen you&#39;re right in the center</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.820" end="00:35:30.090" style="s2">and if you&#39;re kind of periphery</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.590" end="00:35:31.950" style="s2">peripheral to the Roman citizens then</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.090" end="00:35:33.300" style="s2">your little further out and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.950" end="00:35:34.530" style="s2">you know then you have people that are a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.300" end="00:35:36.900" style="s2">little further out and then finally have</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.530" end="00:35:37.560" style="s2">the barbarians that were fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.900" end="00:35:39.840" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.560" end="00:35:41.670" style="s2">fight off and so there&#39;s a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.840" end="00:35:43.770" style="s2">shuts itself up in the hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.670" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">opposition happens towards the outside</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.770" end="00:35:47.790" style="s2">and so that has a very dangerous it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:49.770" style="s2">a day in a dangerous aspect because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.790" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">end up dehumanizing those that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.770" end="00:35:55.710" style="s2">outside but now with that with democracy</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">and a kind of dialectical thinking what</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.710" end="00:36:00.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve end up creating is the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:03.600" style="s2">within it&#39;s so it&#39;s like inside your</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.690" end="00:36:05.880" style="s2">thing you set up an opposition and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.600" end="00:36:08.760" style="s2">then your enemy is your neighbor and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.880" end="00:36:11.310" style="s2">man that is that is a it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.760" end="00:36:13.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a dangerous place to stand</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.310" end="00:36:14.940" style="s2">especially if it ramps up if it you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.350" end="00:36:16.470" style="s2">if it stays at the low level just</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.940" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">discussion it&#39;s not a big deal but as</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.470" end="00:36:21.570" style="s2">we&#39;re watching it ramp up yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:23.430" style="s2">frightening to me I&#39;ve seen some I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.570" end="00:36:24.510" style="s2">seen some very good arguments I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.430" end="00:36:27.690" style="s2">some very good arguments that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.510" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">inevitably ramps up yeah because as you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.690" end="00:36:32.550" style="s2">say it&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:33.750" style="s2">paradigm that popped up for me to kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.550" end="00:36:37.380" style="s2">of make sense of that initially was the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.750" end="00:36:39.930" style="s2">notion of a evolutionary landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.380" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s like a niche a really</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.930" end="00:36:43.260" style="s2">high-quality niche over here in left</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.420" style="s2">space they&#39;re really high-quality needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.260" end="00:36:48.150" style="s2">to be here in right space and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.420" end="00:36:51.450" style="s2">niche construction where if I&#39;m in right</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.150" end="00:36:53.700" style="s2">space the more I moved to the right well</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.450" end="00:36:55.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like a stable but stable place and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.700" end="00:37:00.150" style="s2">right space like I America is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.950" end="00:37:02.100" style="s2">Eisenhower Republicans the the farther a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.150" end="00:37:04.590" style="s2">slightly farther right version of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.100" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2">is ever so slightly more fit as long as</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.590" end="00:37:08.100" style="s2">it&#39;s able to distance itself from that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.450" end="00:37:10.470" style="s2">which is further left and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.100" end="00:37:12.840" style="s2">built-in pressure to select for more and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.470" end="00:37:14.520" style="s2">more polarization yeah it just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.840" end="00:37:19.370" style="s2">that middle which is really the actual</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.520" end="00:37:23.610" style="s2">danger to the to the dyadic structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.370" end="00:37:30.660" style="s2">what I was wondering was if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.610" end="00:37:32.340" style="s2">way to imagine what else Wow I mean real</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.660" end="00:37:39.330" style="s2">time right now guys it besides a king</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.340" end="00:37:43.290" style="s2">David I mean I joke I joke but I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.330" end="00:37:45.390" style="s2">that the idea of having characters or of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.290" end="00:37:47.610" style="s2">having characters that transcend the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.390" end="00:37:49.530" style="s2">political I think that that&#39;s the key so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.610" end="00:37:50.109" style="s2">I say a king or queen yeah it can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.530" end="00:37:51.369" style="s2">that and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.109" end="00:37:54.039" style="s2">has been in the past not that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.369" end="00:37:57.160" style="s2">problematic but it can be Saints - it</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.039" end="00:38:00.549" style="s2">can be holy people that that are that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.160" end="00:38:02.380" style="s2">stand above the fray you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.549" end="00:38:04.299" style="s2">a time for example in the US where</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.380" end="00:38:05.769" style="s2">someone like Billy Graham for all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.299" end="00:38:07.779" style="s2">criticism that I could you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.769" end="00:38:09.279" style="s2">a particular fan of Billy Graham but</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.779" end="00:38:11.230" style="s2">someone like Billy Graham actually stood</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.279" end="00:38:13.180" style="s2">above politics and he would meet with</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.230" end="00:38:14.980" style="s2">with presidents on both sides and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.180" end="00:38:16.869" style="s2">represented a kind of father figure for</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.980" end="00:38:19.019" style="s2">the nation and everybody could agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.869" end="00:38:21.670" style="s2">that Billy Graham&#39;s a good guy you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.019" end="00:38:25.720" style="s2">even if I don&#39;t agree with them and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.670" end="00:38:29.049" style="s2">so it feels like the the current state</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.720" end="00:38:30.609" style="s2">let&#39;s say and and maybe like in America</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.049" end="00:38:32.980" style="s2">maybe one of the things that actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.609" end="00:38:35.950" style="s2">played that role for a little while was</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.980" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">was kind of entertainment I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.950" end="00:38:40.569" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s once again it&#39;s a debase</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:43.420" style="s2">version but uh you know you had these</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.569" end="00:38:45.849" style="s2">let&#39;s say the talk show host of the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.420" end="00:38:47.470" style="s2">Johnny Carson talk show host type where</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.849" end="00:38:50.259" style="s2">he was speaking to everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.470" end="00:38:51.819" style="s2">everybody could tune into Johnny Carson</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.259" end="00:38:54.099" style="s2">and could watch on T Carson and there</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.819" end="00:38:57.880" style="s2">was no politics there was no there was</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.099" end="00:39:00.549" style="s2">no polarization in the in the talk show</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.880" end="00:39:03.279" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that people didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.549" end="00:39:06.099" style="s2">their polarized views but it just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.279" end="00:39:08.920" style="s2">there and so now it&#39;s weird cuz now even</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.099" end="00:39:11.349" style="s2">in entertainment things have polarized</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.920" end="00:39:13.299" style="s2">really strongly in terms of mostly left</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.349" end="00:39:15.730" style="s2">on the left but now we&#39;re seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.299" end="00:39:18.460" style="s2">know with with uh with certain movements</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.730" end="00:39:20.019" style="s2">like alternative media and comics gate</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.460" end="00:39:21.759" style="s2">and all this stuff we&#39;re seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.019" end="00:39:25.150" style="s2">this other side which is which is coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.759" end="00:39:26.519" style="s2">about and his long is is getting it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.150" end="00:39:29.319" style="s2">it&#39;s getting bigger</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.519" end="00:39:31.049" style="s2">yes sir my friend Zack Stein he because</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.319" end="00:39:36.309" style="s2">met Zack at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.049" end="00:39:39.009" style="s2">he&#39;s his his thing is education and meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.309" end="00:39:41.650" style="s2">psychology which is I think very</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.009" end="00:39:44.920" style="s2">consonant with Johnny B&#39;s vision of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.650" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">fourth generation cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.920" end="00:39:50.049" style="s2">as I understand it and one of the quotes</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.880" style="s2">in his recent book actually has to to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.049" end="00:39:57.519" style="s2">precise with this notion that in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.880" end="00:39:59.739" style="s2">states in the US as the the place the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.519" end="00:40:02.799" style="s2">locus and I was in the proper locus for</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.739" end="00:40:04.030" style="s2">the cultivation of meaningfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.799" end="00:40:06.910" style="s2">connectedness which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.030" end="00:40:09.490" style="s2">say the family was most most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.910" end="00:40:14.350" style="s2">and then to the community the lived</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.490" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">community secondarily evaporated there</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.350" end="00:40:20.830" style="s2">was a mapping or a grasping for that in</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:23.160" style="s2">media and school which is a uniquely bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.830" end="00:40:26.830" style="s2">place to locate that particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.160" end="00:40:29.500" style="s2">developmental need and also having grown</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.830" end="00:40:32.410" style="s2">up in America in that context and born</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.500" end="00:40:33.640" style="s2">in 71 I mean I remember the time when</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.410" end="00:40:35.320" style="s2">you would go to school and we would all</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.640" end="00:40:37.360" style="s2">just talk about the TV show that we all</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.320" end="00:40:38.830" style="s2">watched so there was a way to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.360" end="00:40:40.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost like a Roman style</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.830" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">coherence as you say and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.840" end="00:40:43.720" style="s2">notion of okay we&#39;re the in-group</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2">because we all watch this show we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.720" end="00:40:48.910" style="s2">all talk about the same almost like</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:50.860" style="s2">mythopoetic structures we share we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.910" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">keeping up to space up to date on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.860" end="00:40:55.420" style="s2">meta-narrative that is our our culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.140" end="00:40:57.790" style="s2">our poor pitiful commercialized and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.420" end="00:40:59.350" style="s2">poorly written culture starring a David</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.790" end="00:41:02.020" style="s2">Hasselhoff but nonetheless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.350" end="00:41:03.940" style="s2">something it&#39;s something coherent and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.020" end="00:41:05.710" style="s2">then as you end in both at a media level</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.940" end="00:41:08.050" style="s2">because of the the deconstruction of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.710" end="00:41:09.190" style="s2">narrow broadcast channels you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.050" end="00:41:12.130" style="s2">into cable an dimension into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.190" end="00:41:20.370" style="s2">Internet and also at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.130" end="00:41:25.180" style="s2">sort of the continuous metabolism of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.370" end="00:41:27.010" style="s2">meaningfulness into acrimony it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.180" end="00:41:28.540" style="s2">just be built into the heartbeat of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.010" end="00:41:31.240" style="s2">Midway that particular structure of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.540" end="00:41:32.890" style="s2">culture&#39;s design has also done masters</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.240" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">polarized so it&#39;s fragmented and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.890" end="00:41:37.630" style="s2">polarized so even those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:38.980" style="s2">not at all good for holding and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.630" end="00:41:40.570" style="s2">conveying meaningfulness are now also</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.980" end="00:41:42.430" style="s2">absent which i think is a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.570" end="00:41:45.010" style="s2">finger to point in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.430" end="00:41:47.560" style="s2">media crisis yeah and and the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.010" end="00:41:49.870" style="s2">whether you said that I was Iowa I kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.560" end="00:41:54.280" style="s2">of was reminded that one of the places</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.870" end="00:41:56.530" style="s2">that the Romans tried to find that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:41:58.570" style="s2">togetherness was in their entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.530" end="00:42:01.630" style="s2">so I mean the circus for all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.570" end="00:42:03.190" style="s2">horrible that&#39;s was a way a because also</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.630" end="00:42:06.190" style="s2">it was violent entertainment just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.190" end="00:42:09.370" style="s2">our entertainments violent was a way for</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.190" end="00:42:11.620" style="s2">Romans two to be together right it would</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.370" end="00:42:14.770" style="s2">to to to experience the same catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.620" end="00:42:17.500" style="s2">at the same time and so it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.770" end="00:42:20.770" style="s2">as the Romans became less</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.500" end="00:42:22.510" style="s2">Eligius you know especially after after</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.770" end="00:42:25.180" style="s2">Augustus and things started kind of to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.510" end="00:42:27.220" style="s2">fragment there at that at that time it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.180" end="00:42:28.840" style="s2">seems like the circus was a place for</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.830" end="00:42:37.990" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it can last a little while but</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strong enough yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.990" end="00:42:42.610" style="s2">like I like a mapping right now to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:46.180" style="s2">good guy and often him carroll quigley</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.610" end="00:42:47.050" style="s2">he was a historian in the mid century he</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.180" end="00:42:49.060" style="s2">were a really good book called the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.050" end="00:42:50.890" style="s2">evolution of civilizations and one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.060" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2">the things he talked about is that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.890" end="00:42:55.120" style="s2">Golden Age is actually always the death</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.120" end="00:42:58.350" style="s2">happened is is that it&#39;s closed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.740" end="00:43:02.740" style="s2">optimized it&#39;s become progressive and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.350" end="00:43:05.710" style="s2">its vitality is being exchanged for its</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.740" end="00:43:07.810" style="s2">for our hypertrophic ation of the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.710" end="00:43:10.350" style="s2">that it identifies as success so it gets</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.810" end="00:43:14.410" style="s2">a whole lot of you know this case gold</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.350" end="00:43:15.490" style="s2">but it actually is losing vitality</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.410" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">losing meaningfulness losing</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.490" end="00:43:20.440" style="s2">connectedness losing religion in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:21.790" style="s2">deep sense and yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.440" end="00:43:25.330" style="s2">probably there&#39;s a map in there which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.790" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">to say that almost at the at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.330" end="00:43:29.320" style="s2">if you have you shifted if the center of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:31.990" style="s2">the way that your society is maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.320" end="00:43:35.260" style="s2">its integrity as a coherent culture is</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.990" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">living in the domain of media you were</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.260" end="00:43:40.660" style="s2">already dead you may not you the body</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:42.490" style="s2">may not hit the ground for a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.660" end="00:43:44.440" style="s2">while that&#39;s for any how big you are and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.490" end="00:43:48.280" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but death has already</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">set in yeah no I totally agree and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.280" end="00:43:51.700" style="s2">think that you know I mean I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:54.070" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because we probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.700" end="00:43:56.200" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it would been difficult for us</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.070" end="00:43:58.810" style="s2">to perceive it at the dawn of television</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.200" end="00:44:00.670" style="s2">you know we wouldn&#39;t but now it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.810" end="00:44:02.920" style="s2">so obvious and we can see the trace we</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.670" end="00:44:06.040" style="s2">can see the line from television to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.920" end="00:44:08.050" style="s2">Facebook and we can see it breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.040" end="00:44:09.460" style="s2">and now it&#39;s like it&#39;s too late because</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:12.850" style="s2">we&#39;re all on Facebook we&#39;re all on these</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.460" end="00:44:14.590" style="s2">social medias we all when we see how how</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.850" end="00:44:15.820" style="s2">how they&#39;re a caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.590" end="00:44:18.460" style="s2">relationships and now how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.820" end="00:44:22.330" style="s2">alienating to our you know I keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.460" end="00:44:24.850" style="s2">that Facebook is the ultimate version of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.330" end="00:44:26.980" style="s2">the star system that we created with</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.850" end="00:44:29.140" style="s2">media and TV and movies and everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.980" end="00:44:30.910" style="s2">where everybody is a mini star it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.140" end="00:44:32.799" style="s2">you that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.910" end="00:44:34.660" style="s2">you can have a little bit of stardom and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.799" end="00:44:36.819" style="s2">so you&#39;re not actually in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.660" end="00:44:39.190" style="s2">with anybody you&#39;re just exposing</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.819" end="00:44:39.730" style="s2">yourself and then everybody is watching</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.190" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.730" end="00:44:44.020" style="s2">aha they&#39;re not at you and so they can</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:46.450" style="s2">comment on your thing but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.020" end="00:44:49.420" style="s2">have to they you can expose yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.450" end="00:44:52.119" style="s2">and so it&#39;s exposing and voyeurism and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.420" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">it pretends to be actual community but</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.119" end="00:44:58.089" style="s2">it&#39;s acting yeah it&#39;s just a little form</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:45:01.240" style="s2">of stardom and so it&#39;s its front down to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.089" end="00:45:03.339" style="s2">the individual yeah but you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.240" end="00:45:04.839" style="s2">that that has the characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.339" end="00:45:06.210" style="s2">collapsing further and further until</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.839" end="00:45:08.020" style="s2">you&#39;re not even attending to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.210" end="00:45:09.339" style="s2">everything is performative you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.020" end="00:45:10.839" style="s2">performing for yourself you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.339" end="00:45:13.569" style="s2">performing for your friends and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.839" end="00:45:15.970" style="s2">assimilation which another guy who have</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.569" end="00:45:18.520" style="s2">just finally like grasped this guy named</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.970" end="00:45:20.049" style="s2">baudrillard you have about like stages</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.520" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">or levels of simulation and how their</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.049" end="00:45:24.609" style="s2">levels of simulation convert into each</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:26.680" style="s2">other and again we can kind of look back</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.609" end="00:45:28.299" style="s2">and say oh okay weird Stage four I can</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.680" end="00:45:31.329" style="s2">see three two and one now because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.299" end="00:45:32.710" style="s2">got enough perspective on it but then</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.329" end="00:45:35.529" style="s2">you get back to the fact that this nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.710" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">thing at least for the moment and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.529" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">kind of like remembering AI and once</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:47.740" style="s2">again kind of shutting it behind we had</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:49.660" style="s2">38 minutes yet yeah is the return like</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.740" end="00:45:51.309" style="s2">the remembering that you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.660" end="00:45:53.950" style="s2">earlier is that is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.309" end="00:45:56.740" style="s2">always available yeah even though we</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.950" end="00:45:57.190" style="s2">found ourselves alienated in every</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.740" end="00:45:58.660" style="s2">dimension</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.190" end="00:46:00.849" style="s2">you know this the suburbs and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.660" end="00:46:03.880" style="s2">television are part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.849" end="00:46:05.260" style="s2">machinery like you walk around and by</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.880" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">the way where I live you walk down the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.260" end="00:46:09.670" style="s2">street and nobody out what are they</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:11.109" style="s2">doing we&#39;re inside either watching TV or</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.670" end="00:46:13.210" style="s2">staring at the phone and that&#39;s it so</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.109" end="00:46:14.559" style="s2">the capacity for people to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.210" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">context where there&#39;s no human contact</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.559" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">is only facilitated by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.369" style="s2">they can get the scene you lack room</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:22.569" style="s2">with human contact from media but</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.369" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">because they can get the senior actor of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.569" end="00:46:26.559" style="s2">human contact from media super salient</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.119" style="s2">ly like okay Thor is a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.559" end="00:46:29.319" style="s2">interesting than your neighbor yes then</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.119" end="00:46:31.029" style="s2">you don&#39;t go outside and so you get this</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.319" end="00:46:34.299" style="s2">positive for self reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.029" end="00:46:35.980" style="s2">destructive cycle but remembering is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.299" end="00:46:38.020" style="s2">always available and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.980" end="00:46:39.369" style="s2">I sense a renaissance I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.020" end="00:46:41.619" style="s2">again you point to Jordan Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.369" end="00:46:43.869" style="s2">this is what I I identify as being the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.619" end="00:46:44.740" style="s2">most fundamental lesson of that event</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.869" end="00:46:46.260" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.740" end="00:46:48.910" style="s2">the degree to which there was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.260" end="00:46:50.380" style="s2">recognition on the part of a very large</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.910" end="00:46:52.570" style="s2">number of people who were extremely</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.380" end="00:46:56.740" style="s2">thirsty to imbibe something that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.570" end="00:46:58.930" style="s2">real that there was something real and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.740" end="00:47:01.330" style="s2">maybe not for everyone and maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.930" end="00:47:03.010" style="s2">completely real but real and for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.330" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">people who drank it it was a thing they</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.010" end="00:47:09.010" style="s2">needed which kicks something off yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.369" end="00:47:10.240" style="s2">I agree I I mean I agree I in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.010" end="00:47:12.700" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen it myself I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.240" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">people you know I can see it in their</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.700" end="00:47:16.510" style="s2">eyes you can see the change that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:19.780" style="s2">that they have this this like little</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.510" end="00:47:23.350" style="s2">sparkle and so that&#39;s great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.780" end="00:47:25.180" style="s2">wonderful and it but it is it&#39;s varied</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.350" end="00:47:27.730" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult and that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.180" end="00:47:29.860" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.730" end="00:47:31.869" style="s2">with in terms of Jordan and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.860" end="00:47:34.360" style="s2">Bret and in terms of red wine sign and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.869" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">all these people is that maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.360" end="00:47:38.680" style="s2">why also I&#39;m the explicit Christian in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:41.830" style="s2">this whole thing is that I think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.680" end="00:47:44.440" style="s2">see how his things that how this stacks</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.830" end="00:47:47.110" style="s2">up you know and I&#39;m really struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.440" end="00:47:49.150" style="s2">see how it stacks up because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.110" end="00:47:51.940" style="s2">things that let&#39;s say Jordan talks about</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.150" end="00:47:53.830" style="s2">is the individual and I understand he</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.940" end="00:47:55.470" style="s2">says and he doesn&#39;t do it in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.830" end="00:47:57.970" style="s2">individualist sense he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.470" end="00:48:00.670" style="s2">taking responsibility you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.970" end="00:48:02.950" style="s2">big response really for for things and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.670" end="00:48:04.630" style="s2">being an active agent in the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.950" end="00:48:08.080" style="s2">fixing the things around your community</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.630" end="00:48:11.170" style="s2">and everything and but it has to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.080" end="00:48:13.930" style="s2">still has to stack up it has to stack up</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.170" end="00:48:15.820" style="s2">to a higher degree it&#39;s like if you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.930" end="00:48:18.550" style="s2">that let&#39;s say you you fix your family</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.820" end="00:48:20.770" style="s2">and you do that then there those</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.550" end="00:48:22.540" style="s2">families also have to come together and</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.170" style="s2">into our homes and we reproduce that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.040" end="00:49:09.849" style="s2">identity in our families and then we</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.170" end="00:49:12.190" style="s2">reproduce that in ourselves now I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:49:18.940" end="00:49:24.250" style="s2">and I think that so that would that ends</p>

<p begin="00:51:28.380" end="00:51:34.920" style="s2">all that so here I thinking in the word</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:36.810" style="s2">coherence probably as a the way I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.920" end="00:51:39.030" style="s2">describe the thing that replaces</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.810" end="00:51:40.790" style="s2">identity that plays the role that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.030" end="00:51:43.050" style="s2">think is what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.790" end="00:51:46.290" style="s2">and by the way has particular that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.050" end="00:51:50.690" style="s2">characteristic of top-down so it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.290" end="00:51:54.900" style="s2">might call the what is it that enables</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.690" end="00:51:57.480" style="s2">things at the bottom to actually come</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.900" end="00:51:58.980" style="s2">together into things that have and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.480" end="00:52:01.830" style="s2">have an identity meaning a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.980" end="00:52:04.470" style="s2">meaningfulness as a unit a beingness as</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.830" end="00:52:06.180" style="s2">as such that is real like actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.470" end="00:52:08.280" style="s2">effective in world and ma&#39;am it could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.180" end="00:52:10.770" style="s2">very concrete it&#39;s like if one of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.280" end="00:52:12.180" style="s2">gets old and infirm the others stick</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.770" end="00:52:13.590" style="s2">around and support them like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.180" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what it means for that to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.590" end="00:52:20.130" style="s2">real thing yeah and then for that to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:22.230" style="s2">also be able to come together in in in</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.130" end="00:52:23.880" style="s2">higher and higher levels of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.230" end="00:52:26.850" style="s2">frankly just scale as you said you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.880" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">the the the the small family the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.850" end="00:52:31.710" style="s2">distributed family the village the you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:33.000" style="s2">know we might call the the bio region</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.710" end="00:52:36.300" style="s2">whatever it is right some structural</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.000" end="00:52:37.470" style="s2">element that has a vastus and all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.300" end="00:52:41.150" style="s2">way ultimately to the to the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.470" end="00:52:43.950" style="s2">like the whole the whole world which I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.150" end="00:52:45.210" style="s2">think may or may not have been clear in</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.950" end="00:52:47.010" style="s2">the in the video that you watch that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.210" end="00:52:48.840" style="s2">talked about but that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.010" end="00:52:51.210" style="s2">things that I spend a lot of time trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.840" end="00:52:53.550" style="s2">to point out is that that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.210" end="00:52:55.650" style="s2">like where we&#39;re at a moment where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.550" end="00:52:57.090" style="s2">no longer really an option of do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.650" end="00:53:00.090" style="s2">learn how to actually live peaceably</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.090" end="00:53:02.580" style="s2">with all of our neighbors because our</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.090" end="00:53:04.740" style="s2">capacity to destroy things has become</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.580" end="00:53:06.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just getting larger and larger and</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.740" end="00:53:10.530" style="s2">larger every day and so what was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.690" end="00:53:13.650" style="s2">beautiful proposition 2,000 years ago is</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.530" end="00:53:17.340" style="s2">now simply what has to happen this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.650" end="00:53:18.780" style="s2">just very practical so the vivid the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.340" end="00:53:20.520" style="s2">image that came to my mind collage she</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.780" end="00:53:21.870" style="s2">had to one was I&#39;m going back to the</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.870" end="00:53:25.560" style="s2">closing right so one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.790" end="00:53:27.840" style="s2">with identity is when it does that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.560" end="00:53:30.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s an obligate and and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.840" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">forgotten well I am NOT Roman but</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.780" end="00:53:33.960" style="s2">there&#39;s something about Romanist that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:35.250" style="s2">helpful in me being able to have a way</p>

<p begin="00:54:31.560" end="00:54:35.550" style="s2">talking about well to me to think that</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.810" end="00:54:38.100" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about it looks like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.550" end="00:54:40.200" style="s2">it does it looks like a medieval village</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.100" end="00:54:41.220" style="s2">is what it looks like the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.200" end="00:54:42.780" style="s2">it that&#39;s what it looks like to me is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.220" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s something there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.780" end="00:54:47.670" style="s2">transcendent center there&#39;s a center</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:50.010" style="s2">which is actually not of this world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.670" end="00:54:52.440" style="s2">not yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s beyond everything it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.010" end="00:54:53.880" style="s2">ended and that that&#39;s where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.440" end="00:54:55.710" style="s2">meet it&#39;s not there you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.880" end="00:54:57.690" style="s2">there&#39;s signs around it there&#39;s a church</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.710" end="00:54:59.850" style="s2">and there&#39;s a holy there&#39;s an altar and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.690" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a cup and in the cup there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.850" end="00:55:03.750" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s wine and there&#39;s bread</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:05.550" style="s2">but it&#39;s not there it&#39;s all it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.750" end="00:55:07.320" style="s2">the night it&#39;s the seed in the seed and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.550" end="00:55:10.380" style="s2">the seed and seed it&#39;s like it&#39;s hidden</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.320" end="00:55:13.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a hidden reality it&#39;s the you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.380" end="00:55:14.850" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s the the pattern hidden in</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.230" end="00:55:16.710" style="s2">the in the world so that&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.850" end="00:55:19.140" style="s2">transcendent and like you said that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.710" end="00:55:22.230" style="s2">reaches from there all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.140" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">me in being created in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.230" end="00:55:27.660" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like that&#39;s the line and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:31.370" style="s2">then along that line then we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.660" end="00:55:33.660" style="s2">communion communions of love that will</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.370" end="00:55:36.330" style="s2">manifest themselves and so you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.660" end="00:55:37.860" style="s2">and and those will be hierarchical and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.330" end="00:55:39.180" style="s2">in a proper sense in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.860" end="00:55:42.060" style="s2">there are those that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.180" end="00:55:44.280" style="s2">and their their their responsibility is</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.060" end="00:55:45.540" style="s2">to care for those that are below and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.280" end="00:55:48.630" style="s2">those that are below are there to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.540" end="00:55:51.450" style="s2">provide you know that which comes from</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.630" end="00:55:54.330" style="s2">below provide food provide whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.450" end="00:55:57.570" style="s2">needed for the the thing that&#39;s above to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.330" end="00:55:59.700" style="s2">be able to care for you and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.570" end="00:56:01.230" style="s2">just we can I say support because it</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.700" end="00:56:02.940" style="s2">creates a nice symmetry there you go</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.230" end="00:56:04.770" style="s2">somewhere and you get support and here</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.940" end="00:56:07.050" style="s2">you go that&#39;s a that&#39;s a better word</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.770" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a good word and so to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.050" end="00:56:11.460" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what it that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:13.500" style="s2">it looks like that&#39;s the to me that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.460" end="00:56:15.420" style="s2">seems to be the only possible structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.500" end="00:56:17.670" style="s2">for that to to happen like you need</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.420" end="00:56:20.940" style="s2">something you need a tree invisible</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.670" end="00:56:22.830" style="s2">transcendent in the center or else it</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.940" end="00:56:24.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t or else it stops and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.830" end="00:56:27.840" style="s2">the relative becomes nationalism becomes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.870" end="00:56:29.370" style="s2">this and that it becomes you know even</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.840" end="00:56:31.410" style="s2">in terms of religion like if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.370" end="00:56:32.070" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s a mystery you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.410" end="00:56:35.150" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.070" end="00:56:37.380" style="s2">let&#39;s say that God transcends all all</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.150" end="00:56:39.930" style="s2">transcends everything transcends even</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.380" end="00:56:42.420" style="s2">our religious you know even the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.930" end="00:56:44.100" style="s2">religious frame that we have then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.420" end="00:56:45.600" style="s2">also a danger because then we have then</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.100" end="00:56:48.150" style="s2">we have you know the Crusades we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.600" end="00:56:50.600" style="s2">religious wars or whatever yeah but if</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.150" end="00:56:53.220" style="s2">we but if we can fully see that beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.600" end="00:56:55.260" style="s2">even even though let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.220" end="00:56:57.060" style="s2">revelation that we have or the church</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.260" end="00:56:59.820" style="s2">building the tradition we have is true</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.060" end="00:57:01.800" style="s2">that beyond that God is always beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.820" end="00:57:04.440" style="s2">God is always beyond beyond beyond is</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.800" end="00:57:05.220" style="s2">not cannot be contained cannot be cannot</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.440" end="00:57:09.540" style="s2">be framed</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.220" end="00:57:12.510" style="s2">he&#39;s yarn so to me that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.540" end="00:57:14.430" style="s2">for it to to actually work I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.510" end="00:57:16.290" style="s2">another way but maybe maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.430" end="00:57:18.660" style="s2">because I mean maybe that that you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.290" end="00:57:19.770" style="s2">understand by my whole story by why I am</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.660" end="00:57:21.990" style="s2">Who I am why I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.770" end="00:57:24.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like obviously I&#39;ve taken that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.990" end="00:57:26.220" style="s2">drank that kool-aid and so now I my life</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.660" end="00:57:28.410" style="s2">lays itself out that way well I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.220" end="00:57:29.790" style="s2">fortunately for this conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.410" end="00:57:33.750" style="s2">don&#39;t I didn&#39;t drink that kool-aid and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.790" end="00:57:35.370" style="s2">you know I agree so that&#39;s nice I came</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.750" end="00:57:37.080" style="s2">through this to this place through a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.370" end="00:57:38.280" style="s2">very different Road and it&#39;s a road that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.080" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">it looked a lot more like Sam Harris to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.280" end="00:57:43.380" style="s2">be put right so I I can have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:44.900" style="s2">first-person experience that what it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.380" end="00:57:48.750" style="s2">to have it all look at third-person mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.900" end="00:57:49.890" style="s2">and one where my my metaphysics right</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.750" end="00:57:52.740" style="s2">and I&#39;m actually gonna use that to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.890" end="00:57:53.160" style="s2">more foundational than ontology didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.740" end="00:57:56.569" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.160" end="00:57:58.920" style="s2">the transcendence in a meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.569" end="00:58:01.799" style="s2">meaning there was not a way of actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.920" end="00:58:06.359" style="s2">grasping the meaning of transcendence as</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.799" end="00:58:07.770" style="s2">an aspect of the whole thing mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.359" end="00:58:08.730" style="s2">you say reality or world it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.770" end="00:58:12.119" style="s2">bigger than that and that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.730" end="00:58:14.309" style="s2">point and so in this conversation we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.119" end="00:58:15.809" style="s2">actually noticed now three things so if</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.309" end="00:58:17.160" style="s2">I think about and I think this is I</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.809" end="00:58:19.049" style="s2">think I think there&#39;s a very precise</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.160" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">piece here it&#39;s not quite right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.049" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">little bit so we have our sandbox Sam</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:29.970" style="s2">over here who is kind of representing</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">the aspect of the whole thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.970" end="00:58:33.690" style="s2">might call science like I actually I</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:37.890" style="s2">wrote it I wrote an article that</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.690" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">actually had this in it not Sam in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.890" end="00:58:44.369" style="s2">but these distinctions so we might call</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.079" end="00:58:46.619" style="s2">science knowing semantics propositional</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.369" end="00:58:48.510" style="s2">knowledge models of reality those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.619" end="00:58:49.559" style="s2">of things what&#39;s your part like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.510" end="00:58:50.460" style="s2">definitely a part and these are those</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.559" end="00:58:53.220" style="s2">are the frames like you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.460" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">frames creating frames put any things in</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.220" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">frames is very useful and it&#39;s a part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:59:00.270" style="s2">the thing then we have and I hear I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:03.480" style="s2">kind of just forcing the fit but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.270" end="00:59:06.059" style="s2">not terrible it&#39;s we now have I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.480" end="00:59:07.349" style="s2">sandbox Jordan we can do jumping Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.059" end="00:59:09.960" style="s2">no that&#39;s just too hilarious sorry</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.349" end="00:59:13.049" style="s2">sandbox Jordan who&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.960" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">representing living living this like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.049" end="00:59:16.829" style="s2">actual like you said like take</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:20.609" style="s2">responsibility for yourself take</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.829" end="00:59:22.859" style="s2">responsibility for your family live it</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.609" end="00:59:24.630" style="s2">in life does it does actually allow and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.859" end="00:59:26.250" style="s2">support you and thriving then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.630" end="00:59:27.930" style="s2">good choice probably that whole story</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.250" end="00:59:29.789" style="s2">and those are not the same there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.930" end="00:59:30.660" style="s2">distinct and I&#39;m actually by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.789" end="00:59:32.430" style="s2">this is gonna be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.660" end="00:59:33.930" style="s2">challenging but I&#39;m map in my own</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.430" end="00:59:36.150" style="s2">language so this is just semantics so at</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.930" end="00:59:37.650" style="s2">this point I actually mapped with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.150" end="00:59:41.880" style="s2">thing that Jordan Pederson is doing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.650" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">as religion as distinct from science and</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.880" end="00:59:47.039" style="s2">then the third that you&#39;re calling out</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:48.779" style="s2">which I do imagine does seem to me right</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.039" end="00:59:51.690" style="s2">as missing at least explicitly and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.779" end="00:59:53.819" style="s2">have the previous to sandbox people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.690" end="00:59:55.710" style="s2">the transcendent which is analogous</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.819" end="00:59:57.260" style="s2">Tagus mystery and one can one can</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.710" end="00:59:59.849" style="s2">include mystery in religion but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.260" end="01:00:01.890" style="s2">maintain it&#39;s important to hold them</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.849" end="01:00:04.140" style="s2">separately because they are in fact</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.890" end="01:00:05.250" style="s2">different at least that category the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.140" end="01:00:07.020" style="s2">notion of the living &#39;no sand the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.250" end="01:00:08.970" style="s2">rituals and the use of the procession</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.020" end="01:00:11.280" style="s2">and all the the things that we do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.970" end="01:00:13.020" style="s2">enable us to be bound in real bodies</p>

<p begin="01:00:13.020" end="01:00:17.880" style="s2">feeling and the sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.570" end="01:00:20.330" style="s2">to the transcendent all the way up and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.880" end="01:00:23.010" style="s2">down in these different levels is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.330" end="01:00:24.360" style="s2">different quality and you have so those</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.010" end="01:00:26.490" style="s2">are three different things and one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.360" end="01:00:29.540" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve noticed in most</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.490" end="01:00:31.800" style="s2">conversations is that most conversations</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.540" end="01:00:34.800" style="s2">either don&#39;t have all three of those</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.800" end="01:00:38.610" style="s2">things quite often they lack one or two</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.800" end="01:00:39.900" style="s2">of them or the phrase that I used in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.610" end="01:00:43.080" style="s2">article is they cross the streams</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.900" end="01:00:46.370" style="s2">invoking remember our last vestige of</p>

<p begin="01:00:50.460" end="01:00:55.020" style="s2">mystery doing religion you think if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.130" end="01:00:59.040" style="s2">just can hold it and say okay the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.020" end="01:01:00.390" style="s2">transcendent is is you know it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.040" end="01:01:02.430" style="s2">the part of the thing you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.390" end="01:01:05.910" style="s2">the transcendent if you want to do what</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.430" end="01:01:07.770" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do so when you say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.910" end="01:01:09.740" style="s2">curious about when you say that you said</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.770" end="01:01:12.630" style="s2">the transcendent isn&#39;t part of your</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.740" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">metaphysics and so then maybe maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.630" end="01:01:15.450" style="s2">also know that I&#39;m saying the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:16.770" style="s2">transcendent is part of my medical oh it</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.450" end="01:01:18.360" style="s2">is sorry I thought you said what it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.770" end="01:01:20.850" style="s2">sounds like what I noticed is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.360" end="01:01:24.210" style="s2">often absent from the conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.850" end="01:01:25.560" style="s2">exactly yeah no and alternatively to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.210" end="01:01:27.690" style="s2">present and other things are absent</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.560" end="01:01:30.920" style="s2">which is equally problematic yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.690" end="01:01:33.330" style="s2">also because people often they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.920" end="01:01:35.550" style="s2">they I feel like a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.330" end="01:01:38.040" style="s2">especially the modern Christians they</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.550" end="01:01:39.720" style="s2">have this weird two world view of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.040" end="01:01:41.820" style="s2">reality you know it&#39;s like there&#39;s God</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.720" end="01:01:45.150" style="s2">in heaven and there&#39;s there&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.820" end="01:01:46.890" style="s2">here and somehow separate like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.150" end="01:01:48.800" style="s2">I&#39;m Way more of a platanus like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.890" end="01:01:52.350" style="s2">whoever playing this in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.800" end="01:01:54.450" style="s2">you know the transcendent happens at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.350" end="01:01:56.940" style="s2">levels and things transcended all levels</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.450" end="01:01:58.500" style="s2">if they&#39;re in the in holding a cup the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.940" end="01:02:00.990" style="s2">identity of the cup is not in the cup</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.500" end="01:02:02.340" style="s2">you can&#39;t find it it&#39;s if you try it if</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.990" end="01:02:04.500" style="s2">you accumulate the parts of the cup</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.340" end="01:02:07.020" style="s2">you&#39;ll never get to the identity of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.500" end="01:02:09.390" style="s2">cup the identity cup necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.020" end="01:02:11.040" style="s2">transcends the cup and that&#39;s true of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.390" end="01:02:12.540" style="s2">family is true of a country it&#39;s true of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.040" end="01:02:15.300" style="s2">everything and so it&#39;s like if you just</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.540" end="01:02:16.800" style="s2">keep couldn&#39;t if you keep doing that at</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.300" end="01:02:19.500" style="s2">some point it&#39;s like you just keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.800" end="01:02:21.150" style="s2">having things which transcend the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.500" end="01:02:23.310" style="s2">accumulation of predict</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.150" end="01:02:26.460" style="s2">it seems like transcendence is just a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.310" end="01:02:28.080" style="s2">part of a reality people call it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.460" end="01:02:29.970" style="s2">emergence because they don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.080" end="01:02:31.800" style="s2">word transcendence but like I said you</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.970" end="01:02:34.050" style="s2">can see it bottom up if you want but you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.800" end="01:02:36.660" style="s2">can also see it top down to me those two</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.050" end="01:02:38.220" style="s2">are the same it&#39;s just a different just</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.660" end="01:02:40.500" style="s2">you just stand in different ways and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.220" end="01:02:44.250" style="s2">just stand in different places to look</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.500" end="01:02:45.900" style="s2">at it I by the way I&#39;d added the middle</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.250" end="01:02:50.370" style="s2">as well so you can bottom-up top-down</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.900" end="01:02:52.950" style="s2">and right in the middle oh very cool bye</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.370" end="01:02:55.770" style="s2">st. Maximus the Confessor who was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.950" end="01:02:57.570" style="s2">mystic he talks about how he talked</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.770" end="01:02:59.550" style="s2">about the mystic who perceives the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.570" end="01:03:01.710" style="s2">identities of things and their</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.550" end="01:03:04.100" style="s2">particular separate so he can see the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.710" end="01:03:06.810" style="s2">spiritual essences and you can see the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.100" end="01:03:08.340" style="s2">particulars of something you know you</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.810" end="01:03:10.020" style="s2">can see them both and then he realizes</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.340" end="01:03:11.580" style="s2">that they actually don&#39;t contradict each</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.020" end="01:03:14.550" style="s2">other at all that they actually are</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.580" end="01:03:16.560" style="s2">there together that they they represent</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.550" end="01:03:18.270" style="s2">the same reality that it&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.560" end="01:03:20.070" style="s2">the that is really the Incarnation &#39;el</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.270" end="01:03:21.720" style="s2">way of thinking that&#39;s to me that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.070" end="01:03:25.950" style="s2">highest Christian understanding of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.720" end="01:03:27.570" style="s2">world is is that you know it&#39;s platonic</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.950" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">in the sense that it believes in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.570" end="01:03:31.260" style="s2">reality of essences but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:33.600" style="s2">platonic in the sense that it also</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.260" end="01:03:36.330" style="s2">believes that those essences have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.600" end="01:03:38.430" style="s2">incarnated they have to have body and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.330" end="01:03:39.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s the meeting of the two</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.430" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">that middle that you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.960" end="01:03:44.610" style="s2">that&#39;s where reality happens it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:46.260" style="s2">where the where the essences and the and</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.610" end="01:03:47.940" style="s2">the particulars meet that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.260" end="01:03:50.520" style="s2">one of the many where it meets that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.940" end="01:03:53.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the world That&#39;s Life that&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.520" end="01:03:54.840" style="s2">yeah yeah in fact when I was earlier</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.610" end="01:03:57.030" style="s2">struggling with trying to not use the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.840" end="01:03:59.730" style="s2">word real I would say where they meet is</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.030" end="01:04:02.250" style="s2">what is real yeah yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.730" end="01:04:03.810" style="s2">totally yeah I was just gonna interject</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.250" end="01:04:07.110" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re getting towards probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.810" end="01:04:08.730" style="s2">about an hour or so now yep but I just</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.110" end="01:04:11.760" style="s2">want to ask one question if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.730" end="01:04:13.620" style="s2">like a couple of minutes more sure and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.760" end="01:04:17.670" style="s2">what I was hearing you say Jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.620" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2">about we need to rescue a sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.670" end="01:04:22.790" style="s2">transcendent we I know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.500" end="01:04:25.890" style="s2">before about the need for either in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.790" end="01:04:27.480" style="s2">place where religion we need something</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.890" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">in the place where religion used to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.480" end="01:04:32.610" style="s2">or we need I mean I guess you would you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:33.600" style="s2">would probably say that we&#39;ve got one we</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.610" end="01:04:36.750" style="s2">need to renew jokes</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.600" end="01:04:38.910" style="s2">that&#39;s why go ahead and also I heard you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.750" end="01:04:40.230" style="s2">say Jordan that you didn&#39;t what I heard</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.910" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">he say was he didn&#39;t grow up with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.230" end="01:04:43.380" style="s2">place for the transcendent or that</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:45.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t part of your metaphysics but</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.380" end="01:04:47.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned that that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.390" end="01:04:49.650" style="s2">there needs to be a place for the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.700" end="01:04:51.900" style="s2">transcendent I&#39;d love to hear where</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.650" end="01:04:54.500" style="s2">where you might come together what what</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.900" end="01:04:57.570" style="s2">needs to be in that space where religion</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.500" end="01:05:00.780" style="s2">used to be or how do we renew that sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.570" end="01:05:03.470" style="s2">of the transfer well the first there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.780" end="01:05:07.890" style="s2">bunch of things that come up for me so</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.470" end="01:05:13.020" style="s2">the first thing that I notice is like I</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.890" end="01:05:14.460" style="s2">guess care or carefulness or the fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.020" end="01:05:15.960" style="s2">it&#39;s funny so even as a word the word</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.460" end="01:05:18.900" style="s2">sacred is about to leave my mouth I</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.960" end="01:05:21.620" style="s2">immediately want to warn be careful</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.900" end="01:05:24.390" style="s2">because the world that we live in</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.620" end="01:05:26.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a clue what that means more</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.390" end="01:05:27.990" style="s2">or less a lot of this has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.490" end="01:05:31.380" style="s2">this obligate third-person we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.990" end="01:05:32.970" style="s2">talking about so or a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.380" end="01:05:34.620" style="s2">carefulness with the recognition that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.970" end="01:05:36.270" style="s2">the very notion of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.620" end="01:05:38.670" style="s2">can&#39;t be held in the words are using to</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.270" end="01:05:39.780" style="s2">describe it it doesn&#39;t matter what frame</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.670" end="01:05:41.130" style="s2">you&#39;re using it wasn&#39;t other where</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.780" end="01:05:43.110" style="s2">you&#39;re drawing it or speaking it or</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.130" end="01:05:45.120" style="s2">dancing it it doesn&#39;t matter whatever it</p>

<p begin="01:05:46.590" end="01:05:53.340" style="s2">right and so to be able to recover or to</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.520" end="01:05:55.890" style="s2">perhaps remember a capacity and a</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.340" end="01:05:58.260" style="s2">facility the capacity and the facility</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.570" end="01:06:05.400" style="s2">right so this is a key you can&#39;t try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.610" end="01:06:08.160" style="s2">force March tool kits that were used for</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.400" end="01:06:09.780" style="s2">creating models of reality into doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.160" end="01:06:11.040" style="s2">the work of the transcendent they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.150" end="01:06:15.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense because it</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.230" end="01:06:16.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.240" end="01:06:18.270" style="s2">toolkits for using making models of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.770" end="01:06:20.250" style="s2">reality and semantic structures but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.270" end="01:06:21.780" style="s2">just that&#39;s not the thing but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.250" end="01:06:23.820" style="s2">to say that there isn&#39;t a thing there is</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.780" end="01:06:26.370" style="s2">a thing we just have to actually relearn</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.820" end="01:06:27.540" style="s2">or remember how to do it and some of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.370" end="01:06:28.890" style="s2">places we were talking about like this</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.540" end="01:06:30.300" style="s2">difference between pretending and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.890" end="01:06:33.750" style="s2">attending in relationship with your</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.300" end="01:06:36.450" style="s2">child is a really good place to learn</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.750" end="01:06:37.710" style="s2">that thing and to make it very grounded</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.450" end="01:06:40.230" style="s2">right because we other thing is we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.710" end="01:06:41.820" style="s2">we have this again like because of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.230" end="01:06:42.990" style="s2">mistake of the way that we&#39;ve embodied</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.820" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">the trend Center when we try to point</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.990" end="01:06:46.170" style="s2">ourselves at it is we have a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:47.250" style="s2">the transcendent as being somehow too</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.170" end="01:06:49.470" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.250" end="01:06:51.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it can&#39;t possibly be present</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.470" end="01:06:52.920" style="s2">to the moment of my relationship with my</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.660" end="01:06:54.599" style="s2">child because it&#39;s actually this</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.920" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">vastness that is you know bigger than</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.599" end="01:06:58.410" style="s2">mountains when in fact the reality is is</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:07:00.510" style="s2">that it has to be present in every</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.410" end="01:07:02.790" style="s2">moment in every experience in every</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.510" end="01:07:04.319" style="s2">relationship and so learning and when</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.790" end="01:07:05.849" style="s2">being relationship within it that level</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.319" end="01:07:10.500" style="s2">is a great way of grounding it like oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.849" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">oh okay it&#39;s actually not crazy talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.500" end="01:07:17.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not fantasy it&#39;s actually as real</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:19.170" style="s2">as the particulars right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.730" end="01:07:21.210" style="s2">particulars and the transcendent come</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.170" end="01:07:23.490" style="s2">together into what is real and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.210" end="01:07:25.710" style="s2">rebuilding a facility and a capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.490" end="01:07:27.990" style="s2">speak about it or at least a point in</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.710" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">orient our actions and choices in</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.990" end="01:07:32.369" style="s2">relationship with it is a tricky</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:35.130" style="s2">business it has to be done with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.369" end="01:07:37.140" style="s2">care yeah no I I think I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.130" end="01:07:39.300" style="s2">everything you said but of course then I</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.140" end="01:07:41.040" style="s2">then I&#39;ll add my little thing which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.300" end="01:07:43.829" style="s2">you know I talked a little bit before</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.040" end="01:07:46.230" style="s2">about the problem the modern world has</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.829" end="01:07:48.450" style="s2">in terms of oppositional thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.230" end="01:07:50.910" style="s2">means that we&#39;ve set our reality in</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.450" end="01:07:52.920" style="s2">terms of opposition and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.910" end="01:07:55.589" style="s2">once I realize that or once I realize</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.920" end="01:07:58.380" style="s2">that one of the problems is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.589" end="01:08:00.450" style="s2">oppositional attitude and so once I once</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.380" end="01:08:03.630" style="s2">I kind of got that I realized okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.450" end="01:08:06.119" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t need to see my place in</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.630" end="01:08:08.970" style="s2">history as oppositional I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.119" end="01:08:13.410" style="s2">see myself as having to get rid of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.970" end="01:08:15.810" style="s2">which is before rather I need to shine</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.410" end="01:08:18.900" style="s2">as much light as I can on that which was</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.810" end="01:08:23.190" style="s2">before make it bright making make it</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.900" end="01:08:25.739" style="s2">alive and so to me the the solution</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.190" end="01:08:28.410" style="s2">because we are all from I mean we all</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.739" end="01:08:30.660" style="s2">share a similar history all the people</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.410" end="01:08:32.819" style="s2">here that are talking we&#39;re all European</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.660" end="01:08:34.770" style="s2">descent were all you know we are a</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.819" end="01:08:36.239" style="s2">ancestors were all we&#39;re all at least</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.770" end="01:08:38.819" style="s2">our ancestors were all Christians</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.239" end="01:08:40.949" style="s2">probably not that far behind and so you</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.819" end="01:08:44.250" style="s2">know maybe one generation maybe maximum</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.949" end="01:08:48.600" style="s2">two generations behind and so to me that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.250" end="01:08:50.969" style="s2">the the solution is is to reconnect or</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.600" end="01:08:53.549" style="s2">to Rico here to remember all of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.969" end="01:08:57.210" style="s2">things is what I want and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.549" end="01:09:00.060" style="s2">and I want to - like I said make that</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.210" end="01:09:01.070" style="s2">which we had as bright as possible so</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.060" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">that it so that it</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.070" end="01:09:05.870" style="s2">alive today so that it can carry us so</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:09.620" style="s2">that it can it can give us a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.870" end="01:09:11.630" style="s2">place a sense of place in the continuity</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.620" end="01:09:13.730" style="s2">of time and place in space and a place</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.630" end="01:09:15.560" style="s2">in terms of our communities and I know</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.730" end="01:09:17.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy because the fragmentation</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.560" end="01:09:20.330" style="s2">is so strong in our community but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.870" end="01:09:23.180" style="s2">don&#39;t in terms of the scaling up that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.330" end="01:09:25.670" style="s2">talked about before that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.180" end="01:09:27.650" style="s2">thing I see I see all the other types of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.670" end="01:09:30.410" style="s2">movements that kind of move yo religious</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.650" end="01:09:32.750" style="s2">movements and these kind of pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.410" end="01:09:35.300" style="s2">religious or kind of quasi religious</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.750" end="01:09:37.820" style="s2">movements I see them as participating in</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.300" end="01:09:40.010" style="s2">the in the breakdown in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.820" end="01:09:42.290" style="s2">higher maybe they can afford something</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.010" end="01:09:44.990" style="s2">in terms of individual&#39;s own realization</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.290" end="01:09:47.570" style="s2">but they they&#39;re participating in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.990" end="01:09:50.270" style="s2">general breakdown so that&#39;s my you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.570" end="01:09:53.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s at all its its I know that</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.270" end="01:09:54.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s a it&#39;s maybe idealistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.030" end="01:09:59.410" style="s2">but that is that is at least the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.950" end="01:10:01.700" style="s2">road that I&#39;ve kind of got got myself on</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.410" end="01:10:03.770" style="s2">well the last thing that came up for me</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.700" end="01:10:06.590" style="s2">right there was it&#39;s kind of a it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.770" end="01:10:08.210" style="s2">much a double-edged sword and I think is</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.590" end="01:10:11.210" style="s2">the way to actually convert it from a</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.210" end="01:10:14.960" style="s2">sword into a plow sure so if you were</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.210" end="01:10:16.670" style="s2">coming from the late 20th century what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.960" end="01:10:21.620" style="s2">called secular humanists</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.670" end="01:10:24.350" style="s2">scientific materialists lineage and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.620" end="01:10:26.780" style="s2">would like the world to hang together we</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.350" end="01:10:28.040" style="s2">have a very practical problem which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.780" end="01:10:30.110" style="s2">that there&#39;s about a hundred million of</p>

<p begin="01:10:51.860" end="01:10:54.140" style="s2">to browbeat</p>

<p begin="01:11:02.390" end="01:11:06.890" style="s2">is we have to figure out how these guys</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.180" end="01:11:09.470" style="s2">are actually able to enter into a truly</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.890" end="01:11:12.040" style="s2">non oppositional mindset and we need to</p>
