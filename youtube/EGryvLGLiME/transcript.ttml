<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">on the Jim Rutte show I&#39;ve read Nora&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">book and I&#39;ve watched her film and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">get to those but first I&#39;m gonna ask you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">a couple of introductory questions that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">provide some framing maybe first we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">could start off with what is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">International Bateson Institute you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">long history what are your projects so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">the International Bateson Institute is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">actually a who and it&#39;s a grouping of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">people who have been working together</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">over the past five or six years on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">couple of different research projects</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">and the idea is basically to keep some</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">of the the work going that was started</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">by my father Gregory Bateson and before</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:05.610" style="s2">him his father William Bateson and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">also I guess my sister&#39;s in on that Mary</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">Catherine Bateson she&#39;s not actively</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">involved with the Institute not because</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">of anything just because everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:19.270" style="s2">busy</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">and what we are doing is looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.270" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">we can use some of the ideas that my</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">father and his father and others have</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:30.670" style="s2">been generating toward looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">research in another way and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.670" end="00:02:35.890" style="s2">kind of go further how do we take this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:39.190" style="s2">further so at the heart of it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.890" end="00:02:42.310" style="s2">this idea of trends contextual research</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.190" end="00:02:44.470" style="s2">so this word trends contextual comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.310" end="00:02:48.430" style="s2">from Gregory&#39;s book steps to an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.470" end="00:02:51.640" style="s2">of mind and it&#39;s a word that jumped off</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.430" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">the page at me and it was just so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.640" end="00:02:57.970" style="s2">helpful because it was this moment where</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:03:00.970" style="s2">I I realized that well much of my own</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.970" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">work with complexity and context was</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.970" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">getting kind of stuck in the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">of where&#39;s the edge of the context and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">when I started thinking about things</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:13.030" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in multiple contexts</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.540" style="s2">simultaneously and in response to each</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.030" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.540" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">it opened up the possibilities for all</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.910" style="s2">kinds of projects so right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">working on the beginnings of a project</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.910" end="00:03:29.950" style="s2">on how little tiny children ages 3 &amp; 4</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:33.940" style="s2">both perceive and actually can do</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.950" end="00:03:36.190" style="s2">abstract complex thinking which has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.940" end="00:03:39.220" style="s2">fascinating and we did a project on</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.190" end="00:03:41.890" style="s2">addiction and the trans contextual</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.220" end="00:03:46.060" style="s2">process of addiction 1 on learning how</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.890" end="00:03:48.069" style="s2">systems learn projects like that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.060" end="00:03:51.609" style="s2">great and listeners will have a link on</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.069" end="00:03:53.950" style="s2">our website as usual to the Institute so</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.609" end="00:03:55.959" style="s2">you can learn more Nora mentioned her</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.950" end="00:03:57.910" style="s2">father and her grandfather for those of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.959" end="00:03:59.709" style="s2">you who don&#39;t know who they are hers is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.910" end="00:04:02.170" style="s2">a family of great intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.709" end="00:04:04.389" style="s2">distinction Gregory Bateson was one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.170" end="00:04:06.549" style="s2">the great 20th century polymaths his</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.389" end="00:04:08.230" style="s2">home base was in anthropology but he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.549" end="00:04:11.049" style="s2">active in many other fields including</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">being one of the founders of systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.049" end="00:04:16.299" style="s2">thinking and cybernetics her grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:18.130" style="s2">William Bateson was the biologist who</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.299" end="00:04:20.440" style="s2">was the first person to actually use the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.130" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">term genetics to describe the study of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.440" end="00:04:25.479" style="s2">heredity pretty amazing huh and he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:27.250" style="s2">considered one of the chief popularizers</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.479" end="00:04:29.140" style="s2">of the ideas of Gregor</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.250" end="00:04:31.900" style="s2">and all following their rediscovery</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.140" end="00:04:33.760" style="s2">around 1900 very interesting to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.900" end="00:04:34.810" style="s2">from such a family my own family is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.760" end="00:04:36.790" style="s2">quite the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.810" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">my father dropped out of high school</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.790" end="00:04:42.040" style="s2">after ninth grade and my mother grew up</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:44.860" style="s2">on a beat tenant farm in the swamps of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.040" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">northern Minnesota in a house with no</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.860" end="00:04:49.900" style="s2">electricity no running water or no</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:52.480" style="s2">central heat she left home at the age of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.900" end="00:04:54.070" style="s2">14 so those are pretty much the two</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.480" end="00:04:55.420" style="s2">extremes you know you know it&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.070" end="00:04:57.790" style="s2">about that I said kind of like depth</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.420" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">versus freedom you know you&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.790" end="00:05:01.090" style="s2">of stuff for free</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:03.400" style="s2">like for instance science as a cool tool</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.090" end="00:05:05.500" style="s2">to learn about the world but on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.400" end="00:05:07.270" style="s2">other hand there were some biases in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.500" end="00:05:09.040" style="s2">directions that you went you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.270" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">to learn a lot more on my own but on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.040" end="00:05:14.290" style="s2">other hand I was free to study and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:15.910" style="s2">choose what to be your thoughts on what</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.290" end="00:05:18.370" style="s2">the great intellectual distinction of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.910" end="00:05:20.950" style="s2">your family is giving you as a as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.370" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">and a legacy for your life Oh Jim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.950" end="00:05:25.540" style="s2">such a big question we could spend the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:27.220" style="s2">whole hour right there but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.540" end="00:05:29.710" style="s2">just to go back to where you started</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.220" end="00:05:33.220" style="s2">because it could be that even though our</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.710" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">pasts are our ancestry appears different</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.220" end="00:05:37.900" style="s2">it could be that they&#39;re not as</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:41.590" style="s2">different as you think because there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.900" end="00:05:43.540" style="s2">the trappings of the academic world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.590" end="00:05:46.210" style="s2">the sort of the hubbub and the culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.540" end="00:05:52.150" style="s2">of you know British Cambridge culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.210" end="00:05:56.050" style="s2">but actually the reality is that William</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.150" end="00:05:58.570" style="s2">and Gregory were both rejected by that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.050" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">culture because they were fighting from</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.570" end="00:06:03.160" style="s2">from the outside they were pushing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:07.540" style="s2">system in ways it didn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">pushed so I would bet that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.540" end="00:06:14.740" style="s2">onboard experiencial wisdom of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:19.180" style="s2">household was probably more in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.740" end="00:06:21.580" style="s2">with what my family was up to then then</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.180" end="00:06:23.140" style="s2">a lot of what was going on at Cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.580" end="00:06:26.110" style="s2">and I know that sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.140" end="00:06:28.300" style="s2">radical but but the fact is that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.110" end="00:06:32.919" style="s2">were fighters and they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.300" end="00:06:36.820" style="s2">get from the turn of the century William</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.919" end="00:06:41.060" style="s2">was really working toward trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.820" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">understand heredity as a contextual</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">mental process not just something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:48.169" style="s2">was linear inside the organism and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:50.660" style="s2">passed down across generations but</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.169" end="00:06:52.940" style="s2">something that was was visible in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.660" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">relationships and the responsiveness in</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.940" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">those relationships in an actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:07:01.400" style="s2">environment and this was happening at</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:04.430" style="s2">the same time that eugenics was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.400" end="00:07:06.770" style="s2">darling of science and in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.430" end="00:07:08.419" style="s2">I think William like a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.770" end="00:07:10.970" style="s2">scientists I mean remembering that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.419" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">eugenics started well before the turn of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.970" end="00:07:16.550" style="s2">the century you know it was it was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:18.919" style="s2">be a altruistic thing you know eugenics</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.550" end="00:07:21.320" style="s2">was gonna be how we could make better</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.919" end="00:07:23.000" style="s2">society like Plato&#39;s Republic or</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.320" end="00:07:27.530" style="s2">something you know what does it take and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.000" end="00:07:30.470" style="s2">then it turned out of course that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.530" end="00:07:32.590" style="s2">more William was working with it the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.470" end="00:07:35.330" style="s2">more he realized this was an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.590" end="00:07:38.540" style="s2">violation and a vulgarity and he turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.330" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">on his colleagues who were in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.540" end="00:07:43.040" style="s2">eugenics realm and said this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:45.530" style="s2">violence against nature and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.040" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">treasure your exceptions that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.530" end="00:07:51.050" style="s2">a William Bateson meme their treasures</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:53.570" style="s2">are exceptional and that it was in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.050" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2">mutations that you could see how things</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.570" end="00:07:59.390" style="s2">were responding to their contextual</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.580" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">environmental processes so the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.390" end="00:08:05.240" style="s2">this is important is that it it was also</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2">a socio-political</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.240" end="00:08:10.660" style="s2">act okay so it seems like we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.300" end="00:08:13.430" style="s2">about genetics and science but remember</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.660" end="00:08:16.250" style="s2">that what was happening in the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.430" end="00:08:21.320" style="s2">was then getting put into the political</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.250" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">and the journal economic realms and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.320" end="00:08:28.340" style="s2">William has nothing but suspicions for</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:30.260" style="s2">the establishment to the extent that he</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.340" end="00:08:32.510" style="s2">walked away from Cambridge when they</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.260" end="00:08:35.719" style="s2">offered him the first chair and genetics</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.510" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">and went to start his own lab and to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.719" end="00:08:42.620" style="s2">extent that when the King offered him</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:46.040" style="s2">knighthood he refused Wow what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.620" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">make that&#39;s pretty hardcore and he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.040" end="00:08:51.620" style="s2">also one of the people who fought most</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:53.840" style="s2">adamantly for women to be both students</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.620" end="00:08:57.740" style="s2">and professors in the Cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.840" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">université so and then my dad came along</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.740" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">and he too you know this is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.920" end="00:09:05.720" style="s2">that a lot of people who are playing</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:09.890" style="s2">with the ideas of systems and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">know this body of work as a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.890" end="00:09:16.370" style="s2">beautiful intellectual romp of formulas</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:18.680" style="s2">and theories and all kinds of wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.370" end="00:09:22.670" style="s2">material that&#39;s been generated since</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.680" end="00:09:27.380" style="s2">cybernetics and maybe before but when</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.670" end="00:09:31.340" style="s2">Gregory was in New Guinea in 1929 when</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.380" end="00:09:33.530" style="s2">he met Margaret the two of them they</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.340" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">were young he was 25 years old and she</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.530" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">might have been 26 and they were young</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:43.280" style="s2">and they were horrified because at that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:47.060" style="s2">moment what was happening right at that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.280" end="00:09:50.060" style="s2">moment fascism was on the rise and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.060" end="00:09:52.220" style="s2">they started writing letters to their</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.060" end="00:09:55.070" style="s2">friends and this incredible grouping of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.220" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">people who would later become some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.070" end="00:10:00.740" style="s2">the participants of the Macy conferences</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:03.440" style="s2">and they were fighting for what they</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.740" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">called a new kind of science and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">would be a science that would study how</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:11.620" style="s2">the world is put together instead of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:15.050" style="s2">compartmentalizing fragmenting and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.620" end="00:10:16.850" style="s2">taking the world apart and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">know what this was and there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.850" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">great letters there in the Library of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:21.890" style="s2">Congress if you never want to go find</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:23.210" style="s2">them and they&#39;re lovely there are these</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.890" end="00:10:25.250" style="s2">just earnest</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.210" end="00:10:26.840" style="s2">young people who want to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.250" end="00:10:28.670" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.840" end="00:10:32.030" style="s2">with because it doesn&#39;t exist yet so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.670" end="00:10:33.610" style="s2">they&#39;re throwing these words out trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.030" end="00:10:36.590" style="s2">to figure out what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.610" end="00:10:41.390" style="s2">but under it is this beautiful passion</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.590" end="00:10:45.080" style="s2">and the passion is about how to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.390" end="00:10:49.880" style="s2">the trauma and secondary trauma and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.080" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">brokenness of sociocultural post fascism</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.880" end="00:10:56.120" style="s2">world and that&#39;s what they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:11:00.290" style="s2">concerned about so they thought that if</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.120" end="00:11:03.350" style="s2">you could objectify anything it could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.290" end="00:11:05.900" style="s2">exploited and so they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.350" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">think about ways to study the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.900" end="00:11:11.850" style="s2">without objective</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:14.940" style="s2">patient so I you know I I find a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.850" end="00:11:16.950" style="s2">inspiration in that sounds like they</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.940" end="00:11:19.140" style="s2">were thinkers ahead of their time</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.950" end="00:11:21.420" style="s2">another question before we hop into your</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.140" end="00:11:23.160" style="s2">book in both the book and the movie and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.420" end="00:11:25.529" style="s2">some of the talks that you gave which</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.160" end="00:11:29.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve looked at also you use a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.529" end="00:11:30.690" style="s2">analogy of windows from which we look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.160" end="00:11:34.470" style="s2">the world so that our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.690" end="00:11:36.209" style="s2">experience is essentially a window on to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.470" end="00:11:38.040" style="s2">the world I think is the way probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.209" end="00:11:40.140" style="s2">polarizing a little bit if you have such</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.040" end="00:11:42.270" style="s2">beautiful words I&#39;m less a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.140" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">words kind of guy but then that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.270" end="00:11:46.380" style="s2">never quite answer a question that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:48.690" style="s2">always like to start with is what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.380" end="00:11:51.630" style="s2">your view of reality do you believe</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.690" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">there is a single unitary view and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.630" end="00:11:54.690" style="s2">we each have our own subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:58.050" style="s2">experience of that or do you believe</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.690" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">that the subjectivity is somehow tangled</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.050" end="00:12:02.399" style="s2">up in the nature of reality itself that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:04.020" style="s2">makes any sense yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.399" end="00:12:06.029" style="s2">interesting I mean one of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.020" end="00:12:09.500" style="s2">with subjectivity is that it implies</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.029" end="00:12:12.390" style="s2">objectivity and it implies separateness</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.500" end="00:12:14.190" style="s2">this is always a tricky one because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.390" end="00:12:16.170" style="s2">think the best way to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.190" end="00:12:18.660" style="s2">question is really having something to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.170" end="00:12:22.380" style="s2">do with matrix that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.660" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">paradoxes in this so I might like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.380" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">think I have my own perspective my own</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:29.670" style="s2">window on the world but when I actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:33.240" style="s2">look at what&#39;s in that window it all</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.670" end="00:12:35.730" style="s2">came from my context and my contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.240" end="00:12:39.029" style="s2">the experiences of my life it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.730" end="00:12:42.510" style="s2">paradox really so are those ideas my</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.029" end="00:12:46.740" style="s2">ideas is that perception my perception</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.510" end="00:12:51.060" style="s2">or is it a sort of unique concoction of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.740" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">contextual process and so you know on</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.060" end="00:12:57.510" style="s2">the one hand yeah I can definitely say</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:59.459" style="s2">Jim I am Nora and I am so Nora I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.510" end="00:13:02.220" style="s2">do anything but Nora that&#39;s what I do</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.459" end="00:13:04.440" style="s2">right and you go around and you just Jim</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.220" end="00:13:07.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do and we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.440" end="00:13:11.550" style="s2">anything else but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.880" end="00:13:16.290" style="s2">where&#39;s the edge of Nora where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.550" end="00:13:18.600" style="s2">edge of Jim where do you begin and where</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.290" end="00:13:21.370" style="s2">is it that your language or your even</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.600" end="00:13:24.870" style="s2">your microbiome your culture your edge</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.370" end="00:13:28.300" style="s2">pation your family your ideas your</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.870" end="00:13:31.960" style="s2">brokenhearted memories you&#39;re like where</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.300" end="00:13:34.839" style="s2">are those boundaries I don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.960" end="00:13:37.029" style="s2">seems very fluid to me yeah we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.839" end="00:13:38.830" style="s2">about that it&#39;s quite specifically as we</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.029" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">get into the book but I the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.830" end="00:13:43.779" style="s2">reality itself are you a person who</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:46.360" style="s2">believes in a naive realism that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.779" end="00:13:48.070" style="s2">is an actual physical world out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.360" end="00:13:49.810" style="s2">that we&#39;re interacting with despite the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.070" end="00:13:51.940" style="s2">fact that it is complicated because our</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.810" end="00:13:54.820" style="s2">subjectivity is actually part of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.940" end="00:13:58.089" style="s2">world Oh what you&#39;re saying yeah sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.820" end="00:14:01.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t answer that question do I believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.089" end="00:14:04.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a reality out there yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.810" end="00:14:07.150" style="s2">I do I think that you know I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.870" end="00:14:09.610" style="s2">the tree ism is a tree and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.150" end="00:14:12.010" style="s2">think there&#39;s a tree there but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:14.470" style="s2">perceiving as tree now that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.010" end="00:14:16.810" style="s2">question indeed absolutely and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.470" end="00:14:18.820" style="s2">we&#39;re probably Foursquare on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.810" end="00:14:21.220" style="s2">of that because there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.820" end="00:14:22.990" style="s2">people these days who at least question</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.220" end="00:14:25.480" style="s2">whether objective reality actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.990" end="00:14:26.770" style="s2">exists outside of ourselves and then of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.480" end="00:14:28.570" style="s2">course there&#39;s an error or at least I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.770" end="00:14:31.660" style="s2">would call it an error on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.570" end="00:14:33.670" style="s2">which tries to minimize the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.660" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">subjectivity and it seems to be that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.670" end="00:14:37.150" style="s2">something close to a right way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.610" style="s2">thinking about the world is both as is</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.150" end="00:14:41.260" style="s2">so often the case right yeah there is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.610" end="00:14:43.959" style="s2">objective reality out there which we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.260" end="00:14:46.570" style="s2">never know in its fullness right and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.959" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">have a subjectivity which is I love your</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.570" end="00:14:50.860" style="s2">models which is a window onto that world</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.790" end="00:14:53.410" style="s2">and oh by the way that window is part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.860" end="00:14:55.529" style="s2">the world right and as you say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.410" end="00:14:57.430" style="s2">somewhat tangled up and almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.529" end="00:14:58.450" style="s2">paradoxical but hey that&#39;s just the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.430" end="00:15:02.230" style="s2">it is we&#39;ve got to work our way through</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.450" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">it yeah I think that the paradox is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.230" end="00:15:06.100" style="s2">really valuable yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:07.930" style="s2">don&#39;t be afraid of it do not be afraid</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.100" end="00:15:10.300" style="s2">of what seems like a barrier no I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.930" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s if you play with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.300" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">paradox if you live with that paradox it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:19.270" style="s2">allows you to kind of zoom in and zoom</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.520" end="00:15:22.740" style="s2">out simultaneously and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.270" end="00:15:25.420" style="s2">probably the most productive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.740" end="00:15:27.339" style="s2">thinking that I&#39;ve ever experienced</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.420" end="00:15:30.790" style="s2">because it allows for a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.339" end="00:15:33.640" style="s2">strictness and a rigor but also for</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.790" end="00:15:34.649" style="s2">there to be fluidity and blurred Ness</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.640" end="00:15:39.119" style="s2">and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.649" end="00:15:42.300" style="s2">humility of curiosity and care so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.119" end="00:15:43.589" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to have both talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.300" end="00:15:45.329" style="s2">eyes one of things I loved about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.589" end="00:15:49.019" style="s2">book was how you kept that tension</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.329" end="00:15:51.029" style="s2">between the liminal but also rigor right</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.019" end="00:15:52.649" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting some people go too far</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.029" end="00:15:54.389" style="s2">in one direction or the other yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.649" end="00:15:56.339" style="s2">have this beautiful tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.389" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">two so with that let&#39;s hop in talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.339" end="00:16:00.809" style="s2">your book and the title of the book is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:03.059" style="s2">small arcs of larger circles available</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.809" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">on Amazon and we&#39;ll have a link to it on</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.059" end="00:16:09.300" style="s2">the episode page as usual one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:11.550" style="s2">first things I reacted strongly to in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.300" end="00:16:14.279" style="s2">the book was but the mountainsides of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.550" end="00:16:16.499" style="s2">Big Sur California the scent of sage in</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.279" end="00:16:19.110" style="s2">the warm Sun the salty fog of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.499" end="00:16:21.779" style="s2">Pacific Ocean and the ancient redwoods</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.110" end="00:16:25.769" style="s2">are the Bible upon which I swear my</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.779" end="00:16:28.499" style="s2">truth I love that Big Sur has always</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.769" end="00:16:31.589" style="s2">been this magnet for me I first</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.499" end="00:16:33.209" style="s2">discovered it on a my first hitch cross</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.589" end="00:16:36.209" style="s2">country hitchhiking trip I actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.209" end="00:16:37.860" style="s2">hitchhiked down Highway 1 and slept on</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.209" end="00:16:40.889" style="s2">some hippies couch for a couple days</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.860" end="00:16:43.499" style="s2">that Big Sur and went all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.889" end="00:16:45.929" style="s2">to LA and I always get draw back I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.499" end="00:16:47.689" style="s2">close to Big Sur I have to go there</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.929" end="00:16:50.610" style="s2">because there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.689" end="00:16:52.949" style="s2">setting that just is like in the world I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:16:55.589" style="s2">know no greater place in some sense to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.949" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">ring my bell and so I was very taken</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.589" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">with that as an early quote from your</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">book you&#39;ve actually spent a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:03.779" style="s2">of time there habitude I have I I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:06.510" style="s2">when I think of this sort of impossible</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.779" end="00:17:09.179" style="s2">question of what is home for me that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.510" end="00:17:12.839" style="s2">home and I was there quite a bit as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.179" end="00:17:16.260" style="s2">child we had a house actually up on</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.839" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">Gordon mountain and then when my father</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.260" end="00:17:23.309" style="s2">got sick we moved to Esalen and those</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:27.240" style="s2">were the days I tell you it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.309" end="00:17:32.460" style="s2">different era of the early 70s up to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:36.059" style="s2">about 1984 I was there at least half the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.460" end="00:17:37.620" style="s2">year of every year so that explains a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.059" end="00:17:39.330" style="s2">fair amount about who you are if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.620" end="00:17:42.450" style="s2">spent that much time at a place that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.330" end="00:17:43.809" style="s2">it&#39;s so powerful in every way as big</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.450" end="00:17:45.610" style="s2">sewer that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.809" end="00:17:47.860" style="s2">explains it another interesting quote</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.610" end="00:17:50.409" style="s2">right away which a little bit or ocular</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:52.330" style="s2">like some unfair bits of the book are is</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.409" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">to be a participant in a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.330" end="00:17:58.419" style="s2">is to desire to be both lost and found</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:01.990" style="s2">in the interrelationships between people</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.419" end="00:18:05.980" style="s2">nature and ideas could you unpack that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.990" end="00:18:10.929" style="s2">little bit for yeah I think that I am</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.980" end="00:18:13.320" style="s2">very curious about what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.929" end="00:18:16.419" style="s2">alive what what it means to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.320" end="00:18:18.820" style="s2">culture but also you know living in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.419" end="00:18:21.009" style="s2">complex system that is my own body and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.820" end="00:18:23.980" style="s2">relationship with other people&#39;s bodies</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.009" end="00:18:27.340" style="s2">and the ecology and just all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.980" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">beautiful complex systems and terrible</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.340" end="00:18:32.769" style="s2">complex systems in relationship to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:36.129" style="s2">other always shifting responding moving</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.769" end="00:18:39.700" style="s2">and you know you can&#39;t ever be</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.129" end="00:18:42.850" style="s2">completely sure of what it is but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.700" end="00:18:45.549" style="s2">also not ever completely unsure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.850" end="00:18:48.879" style="s2">this business of being a participant in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.549" end="00:18:51.879" style="s2">life is its onboard it&#39;s in us right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.879" end="00:18:55.029" style="s2">we we are both utterly confused by it</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.879" end="00:18:58.749" style="s2">but it is the way that we know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.029" end="00:19:00.610" style="s2">both of those things and the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.749" end="00:19:06.299" style="s2">the complex systems that we&#39;re within</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.610" end="00:19:10.210" style="s2">spans not just ecology and cognition but</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.299" end="00:19:12.759" style="s2">also culture and social interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.210" end="00:19:15.490" style="s2">I would say also interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.759" end="00:19:19.149" style="s2">technologies and that somehow those</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.490" end="00:19:21.700" style="s2">things aren&#39;t even separable so where</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.149" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">are we in that gym who are we in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.700" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">and yeah is there really a boundary</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.230" style="s2">between the game and the player right</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.610" end="00:19:31.710" style="s2">like well one of things I like to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.230" end="00:19:35.289" style="s2">about complexity and how it differs from</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.710" end="00:19:36.669" style="s2">reductionism is that reductionism is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.289" end="00:19:38.919" style="s2">study of the dancer</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.669" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">while complexity is the study of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.919" end="00:19:44.289" style="s2">dance and you can&#39;t have the dance</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:46.929" style="s2">without the dancer mm-hmm yeah I like</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.289" end="00:19:49.179" style="s2">that yeah that kind of come to like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.929" end="00:19:51.759" style="s2">little line myself you know something</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.179" end="00:19:52.899" style="s2">the you know next step in your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.759" end="00:19:55.539" style="s2">that came out as you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.899" end="00:19:58.119" style="s2">something called mental mono cropping</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.539" end="00:19:59.889" style="s2">yeah I like I love that I&#39;m gonna I may</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.119" end="00:20:01.659" style="s2">well steal that with attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.889" end="00:20:03.879" style="s2">course you know the idea of generating</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.659" end="00:20:06.340" style="s2">ideas and singular fields that are bred</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.879" end="00:20:08.710" style="s2">to be resistant to cross-pollination</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.340" end="00:20:10.659" style="s2">goddamn right it is interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.710" end="00:20:13.629" style="s2">medically they build these walls in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.659" end="00:20:15.460" style="s2">academia education media and social</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.629" end="00:20:17.979" style="s2">structures present overlapping patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.460" end="00:20:19.809" style="s2">of compartmentalization why just one</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.979" end="00:20:22.869" style="s2">concept of birth marriage death</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.809" end="00:20:25.450" style="s2">friendship work economy right or wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.869" end="00:20:27.190" style="s2">right that&#39;s I love that sense of struck</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.450" end="00:20:28.629" style="s2">such strong language you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.190" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">associated with the Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.629" end="00:20:34.419" style="s2">now for the last 18 years and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:36.190" style="s2">we work really hard to work past those</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.419" end="00:20:38.950" style="s2">boundaries but mam you get out to other</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.190" end="00:20:42.220" style="s2">parts so especially academia those walls</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.950" end="00:20:45.369" style="s2">are huge right but and yet we both know</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.220" end="00:20:47.619" style="s2">they&#39;re entirely artificial yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.369" end="00:20:50.950" style="s2">know people base their entire lives on</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.619" end="00:20:53.830" style="s2">them and you know increasingly the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.950" end="00:20:56.830" style="s2">of a profession within or outside of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.830" end="00:21:01.239" style="s2">academia is partitioned into ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.830" end="00:21:05.769" style="s2">smaller bits of mana corrupt information</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.239" end="00:21:08.109" style="s2">okay this is really dangerous it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.769" end="00:21:11.169" style="s2">literally with the soil of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.109" end="00:21:14.229" style="s2">and who we can be as human being where</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.169" end="00:21:16.419" style="s2">we can what&#39;s got deep and it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.229" end="00:21:18.690" style="s2">reason I was drawn when I retired from</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.690" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">complexity science because it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.950" end="00:21:25.659" style="s2">radically oriented towards working</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.059" style="s2">across all these levels as if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.659" end="00:21:30.369" style="s2">didn&#39;t even exist but we have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.059" end="00:21:32.830" style="s2">so much against the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.369" end="00:21:34.139" style="s2">obstructions for instance government</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.830" end="00:21:36.909" style="s2">funding from the National Science</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.139" end="00:21:39.789" style="s2">Foundation we do quite well winning</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.909" end="00:21:41.710" style="s2">those competitive grants but the process</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.789" end="00:21:43.659" style="s2">is just unbelievably hard because if a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.710" end="00:21:47.019" style="s2">project spans multiple so-called</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.659" end="00:21:48.519" style="s2">disciplines it has to be approved by you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.019" end="00:21:50.769" style="s2">know basically reviewers in all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.519" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">disciplines rather than having a group</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.769" end="00:21:54.940" style="s2">of reviewers who are who are able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">look across disciplines it just makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.940" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">the whole process literally three times</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:02.200" style="s2">harder and so much of our intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">world I guess it came from the German</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.200" end="00:22:07.059" style="s2">university system is all generated</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">around the old joke about a PhD which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.059" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">knowing more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:12.050" style="s2">less and less until you go absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:16.580" style="s2">every everything about absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.050" end="00:22:18.440" style="s2">nothing well exactly and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.580" end="00:22:20.300" style="s2">that then when it&#39;s peer reviewed by</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.440" end="00:22:22.430" style="s2">people who are inside those various</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.300" end="00:22:25.550" style="s2">disciplines the of course it just gets</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.430" end="00:22:27.560" style="s2">resized and the information that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.550" end="00:22:30.140" style="s2">actually in the space in between is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.560" end="00:22:33.320" style="s2">readable - none of those silos because</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.140" end="00:22:36.010" style="s2">it isn&#39;t there I mean what actually is</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.320" end="00:22:38.600" style="s2">going to come out of those more a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.010" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">phenomenon you know of one sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.600" end="00:22:42.560" style="s2">covered coming into contact with another</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.730" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">and then a new thing happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.560" end="00:22:49.310" style="s2">and who&#39;s gonna check that which</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.090" end="00:22:54.410" style="s2">department does that happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.310" end="00:22:55.970" style="s2">liminal Department I&#39;m gonna look up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.410" end="00:22:58.790" style="s2">catalog of Harvard and see if they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.970" end="00:23:01.700" style="s2">a little depart yeah but like the bet I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.790" end="00:23:04.280" style="s2">bet you lunch later and when they do</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.700" end="00:23:06.370" style="s2">let&#39;s just give up okay Jim yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.280" end="00:23:08.420" style="s2">it&#39;ll be bad but it&#39;s put a floor in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.370" end="00:23:10.460" style="s2">at the Santa Fe Institute we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.420" end="00:23:12.200" style="s2">constantly convening workshops I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.460" end="00:23:15.110" style="s2">know fifteen or twenty a year that go</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.200" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">across disciplines and typically their</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.110" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2">three-day meetings that recur you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:20.810" style="s2">over a period of years where groups</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:23.330" style="s2">people from different disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.810" end="00:23:25.640" style="s2">attempt to you know work on a problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.330" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">across lines and one of the ones I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.640" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">familiar with is the ongoing work we</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:32.630" style="s2">have done on the on state formation</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">looking at everything from biology to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.630" end="00:23:37.640" style="s2">linguistics the anthropology to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:39.410" style="s2">economics and one of the truisms of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.640" end="00:23:41.030" style="s2">people who do this for a living I guess</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.410" end="00:23:43.070" style="s2">you get to be a spectator most of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.030" end="00:23:45.080" style="s2">time sometimes I participate in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.070" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve even held some workshops but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.080" end="00:23:49.430" style="s2">usual rule of thumb is you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">the first two and a half days is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.430" end="00:23:52.280" style="s2">getting the people from the different</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:54.980" style="s2">disciplines to agree on a common</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.280" end="00:23:56.690" style="s2">vocabulary right exactly and but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.980" end="00:23:58.670" style="s2">very important to do that up front and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.690" end="00:24:00.980" style="s2">and of course people always slip back</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.670" end="00:24:02.980" style="s2">into their own vocabulary but that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.980" end="00:24:05.990" style="s2">that&#39;s that seems to be job one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.980" end="00:24:07.580" style="s2">working on something truly what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.990" end="00:24:09.590" style="s2">word for it you have a better word than</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.580" end="00:24:11.210" style="s2">any I&#39;ve seen before and contextual</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.590" end="00:24:15.290" style="s2">trance context well that&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.210" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">transdisciplinary so - I&#39;m so happy with</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.290" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">trans contextual I am - I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.650" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">five days ago I was reading your book</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:24.070" style="s2">and so I&#39;m gonna try to propagate that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">meme see what happens yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.070" end="00:24:28.540" style="s2">first epic trance contextual is to try</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:30.850" style="s2">to develop at least a subset language</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.540" end="00:24:32.800" style="s2">that allows people coming from very</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.850" end="00:24:35.530" style="s2">different places to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.800" end="00:24:38.140" style="s2">meaningfully exactly and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.530" end="00:24:40.210" style="s2">really interesting project because one</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.140" end="00:24:44.220" style="s2">of the things that they have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.210" end="00:24:47.560" style="s2">they have to actually speak not only in</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.220" end="00:24:50.140" style="s2">their professional speak but they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.560" end="00:24:53.560" style="s2">to actually speak in other textures and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.140" end="00:24:57.160" style="s2">tones of communication as well to get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.560" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">those other contexts so that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.160" end="00:25:00.910" style="s2">interesting thing that I&#39;ve been playing</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:03.700" style="s2">with and you might have felt that in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.910" end="00:25:06.910" style="s2">book that there&#39;s a tone mixture going</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.700" end="00:25:09.460" style="s2">on because the these different tones</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.910" end="00:25:11.560" style="s2">pull each other in two different windows</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.460" end="00:25:14.140" style="s2">of meaning right they&#39;re like musical</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.560" end="00:25:17.350" style="s2">notes mean something different next to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.140" end="00:25:18.550" style="s2">other rhythms right yeah one of the cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.350" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">things I&#39;ll just point out for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.550" end="00:25:23.530" style="s2">audience the reason is you go by this</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:26.050" style="s2">book is there&#39;s a number of prose essays</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.530" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">and examinations but between them are</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.050" end="00:25:31.390" style="s2">some generally fairly short but rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:33.610" style="s2">beautiful bits of poetry and I felt that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.390" end="00:25:36.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna deal with the trans</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.610" end="00:25:40.300" style="s2">contextual complexity of life then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.760" end="00:25:43.960" style="s2">have to be able to explore from our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.300" end="00:25:46.870" style="s2">different context of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.960" end="00:25:49.210" style="s2">what that is so if I want to think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.870" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">the complexity of climate science I need</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.210" end="00:25:56.730" style="s2">to actually figure out and have some</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:26:00.610" style="s2">sense of how that meets my emotional</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.730" end="00:26:04.800" style="s2">responsibilities or or experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.610" end="00:26:07.530" style="s2">being a parent of being a spouse of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.800" end="00:26:10.180" style="s2">presenting myself to a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.530" end="00:26:12.070" style="s2">yeah what it is to have a life right</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.180" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">that seems to be missing from things</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.070" end="00:26:16.750" style="s2">like climate discussions all too often</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:19.270" style="s2">or it&#39;s a discussion of numbers and such</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.750" end="00:26:21.130" style="s2">and while that&#39;s important you know this</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.270" end="00:26:22.870" style="s2">is going to become a dominant phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.130" end="00:26:24.580" style="s2">about what it is to have a life and if</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.870" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t think about it in that context</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.580" end="00:26:28.510" style="s2">we&#39;re missing a huge part of the store</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:31.539" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it right there Jim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.510" end="00:26:33.369" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s exactly it</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.539" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the issue I think the biggest issue</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.369" end="00:26:36.909" style="s2">we&#39;re facing right now yeah I made a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.309" style="s2">note to myself that you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.909" end="00:26:41.109" style="s2">anthropology is certainly a huge help in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.309" end="00:26:42.909" style="s2">somewhat getting over some of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.109" end="00:26:45.249" style="s2">ideas about a single lake for instance</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.909" end="00:26:47.229" style="s2">the words you used a single concept of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.249" end="00:26:49.450" style="s2">birth marriage death friendship work</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.229" end="00:26:51.100" style="s2">economy you know anyone who&#39;s read any</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.450" end="00:26:53.470" style="s2">anthropology at all knows there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.100" end="00:26:55.720" style="s2">amazing variety of ways that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.470" end="00:26:57.789" style="s2">found the ability to live together right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.720" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so important for</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.789" end="00:27:02.019" style="s2">people to read some anthropology so</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.100" end="00:27:03.700" style="s2">they&#39;re not so tunnel visions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.019" end="00:27:05.529" style="s2">thinking that oh yeah we got to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.700" end="00:27:06.970" style="s2">this exactly this kind of marriage or</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.529" end="00:27:08.429" style="s2">this kind of nature of work</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.970" end="00:27:10.419" style="s2">humans have solved those problems</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.429" end="00:27:12.519" style="s2">thousands of different ways over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.419" end="00:27:15.009" style="s2">years and that whole tool kits available</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.519" end="00:27:17.019" style="s2">for us going forward should be should we</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.009" end="00:27:18.940" style="s2">have the nerve to look at it I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.019" end="00:27:21.070" style="s2">it&#39;s probably one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.940" end="00:27:24.249" style="s2">things we can do right now it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.070" end="00:27:28.450" style="s2">ironic too because there&#39;s such a sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.249" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">of seemingly rabid allergy to having</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.450" end="00:27:35.470" style="s2">cross-cultural interaction right now and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:37.749" style="s2">yet without it there&#39;s no way to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.470" end="00:27:40.330" style="s2">the blind spots it&#39;s in those</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.749" end="00:27:42.039" style="s2">relationships where you find that you</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:52.539" style="s2">discover entirely new possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.049" end="00:27:55.299" style="s2">ways of seeing and living and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.539" end="00:27:58.119" style="s2">people are going to find any sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.299" end="00:28:01.659" style="s2">sense making new ways of living but</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.119" end="00:28:04.749" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need that if nothing else to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.659" end="00:28:07.779" style="s2">stir the pot not necessarily to adopt</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.749" end="00:28:11.109" style="s2">other people&#39;s ideas but to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.779" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">that our own like you said tunnel vision</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.109" end="00:28:16.779" style="s2">and these things they sneak right up on</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:20.049" style="s2">you and you just don&#39;t see them coming I</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.779" end="00:28:22.979" style="s2">have this this story that I often tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.049" end="00:28:26.229" style="s2">about my one of my Swedish step cats who</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.979" end="00:28:28.090" style="s2">was making a sandwich for breakfast and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.229" end="00:28:30.789" style="s2">they eat sandwiches for breakfast here</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:32.619" style="s2">and in Sweden you cut cheese with this</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.789" end="00:28:34.359" style="s2">cheese thing that you pull across the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.619" end="00:28:36.609" style="s2">top of the cheese the cheese sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.359" end="00:28:38.470" style="s2">plainer and I think in my life in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.609" end="00:28:40.119" style="s2">experience and living in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.470" end="00:28:42.179" style="s2">Canada everybody owned one of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.119" end="00:28:44.830" style="s2">things but nobody ever actually used it</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.179" end="00:28:45.430" style="s2">because if you pull the cheese slicer</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.830" end="00:28:47.230" style="s2">across the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.430" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">top of the whole cheese then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.230" end="00:28:51.580" style="s2">taken somebody&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:55.630" style="s2">somebody&#39;s kids who was gonna slice it</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.580" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">you know up and down and so he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.630" end="00:28:59.350" style="s2">trying to cut the cheese and I said you</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:01.660" style="s2">can find the pink cutter and he said I</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.350" end="00:29:03.700" style="s2">can&#39;t find it I said oh just use a knife</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.660" end="00:29:05.230" style="s2">it&#39;s probably in the dishwasher and he</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.700" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">bumped him he thumped in five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.230" end="00:29:12.130" style="s2">went by and then he said it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:14.440" style="s2">working and I went in and he was trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.130" end="00:29:17.740" style="s2">to push the knife across the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.440" end="00:29:20.770" style="s2">cheese headfirst like it was the cheese</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.740" end="00:29:22.900" style="s2">planer and you know it never occurred to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.770" end="00:29:24.760" style="s2">me that he was going to do that and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.900" end="00:29:28.990" style="s2">never occurred to him to do it any other</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:32.380" style="s2">way and sort of looked at each other and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.990" end="00:29:33.370" style="s2">thought well that never occurred to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.380" end="00:29:35.890" style="s2">either one of us</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.370" end="00:29:38.800" style="s2">and the reason I&#39;m bothering to tell</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.890" end="00:29:42.220" style="s2">this story is that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.800" end="00:29:45.100" style="s2">really important there which is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.220" end="00:29:48.790" style="s2">opening of a possibility of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.100" end="00:29:52.690" style="s2">what you never considered and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.790" end="00:29:54.940" style="s2">just so much potential for new kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.690" end="00:29:56.980" style="s2">perception in exactly that space and of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.940" end="00:29:59.490" style="s2">course you know what is a society or a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.980" end="00:30:02.860" style="s2">culture except a conglomeration of other</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.490" end="00:30:06.430" style="s2">cultures and societies right I mean of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.860" end="00:30:09.130" style="s2">course I which this party here that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.430" end="00:30:11.140" style="s2">a midsummer which is a big deal in</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.130" end="00:30:13.060" style="s2">Sweden a midsummer party and they had</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.140" end="00:30:15.340" style="s2">this little quiz about all the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.060" end="00:30:18.570" style="s2">that are Swedish midsummer cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:22.300" style="s2">things the food the dress the songs the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.570" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">rituals all this stuff none of them were</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.300" end="00:30:30.490" style="s2">from Sweden and and so this business of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:32.590" style="s2">whether you study anthropology or just</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.490" end="00:30:34.330" style="s2">to hang out with people and pay</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.590" end="00:30:37.270" style="s2">attention to the way they think in</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.330" end="00:30:39.550" style="s2">different ways than you do it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.270" end="00:30:41.110" style="s2">me the only way out of the matrix yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.550" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">certainly very very good weight out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.110" end="00:30:46.060" style="s2">the matrix for sure in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:48.190" style="s2">interestingly a guy I know Joe shabak</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.060" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">guy works in AI but he&#39;s also a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.190" end="00:30:51.490" style="s2">general thinker about things he posted</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:53.140" style="s2">something on Twitter recently which</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.490" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">caught my attention and he said you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.140" end="00:30:58.580" style="s2">an ideal Society would be one that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:31:00.529" style="s2">radically open to knowing all about</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.580" end="00:31:03.710" style="s2">other societies and picking and choosing</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.529" end="00:31:06.169" style="s2">those components that work best and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.710" end="00:31:08.840" style="s2">adopting them ruthlessly in their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.169" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">society and yet my response was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.840" end="00:31:13.250" style="s2">that is that sounds perfect to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:15.620" style="s2">unfortunately human chauvinism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.250" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">xenophobia seem to make that hard for an</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.620" end="00:31:18.309" style="s2">awful lot of people to do yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:21.019" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.309" end="00:31:23.390" style="s2">what I think is actually I would push it</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.019" end="00:31:26.690" style="s2">one step further which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.390" end="00:31:28.700" style="s2">what I learned from that was not really</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.690" end="00:31:33.590" style="s2">about how Swedes think about cutting</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.700" end="00:31:36.260" style="s2">cheese but how my own frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.590" end="00:31:38.389" style="s2">and perception was limited and that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.260" end="00:31:40.760" style="s2">the important piece of information it</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.389" end="00:31:43.130" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really about the practices it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.760" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">about thinking in a different way which</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.130" end="00:31:48.460" style="s2">I mean where did the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">that the little experience bubble up</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.460" end="00:31:53.210" style="s2">maybe you know on the bus three days</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:55.700" style="s2">later when someone stepped in front of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.210" end="00:31:57.320" style="s2">me I didn&#39;t think mmm I can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.700" end="00:31:59.570" style="s2">this person stepped in front of me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">I thought about that in another way you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.570" end="00:32:05.630" style="s2">know so it&#39;s it&#39;s not a linear process</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">of what happens when you start to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.630" end="00:32:13.130" style="s2">recognize those it&#39;s not harvesting new</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:15.289" style="s2">concepts it&#39;s actually it&#39;s inhabiting a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.130" end="00:32:17.269" style="s2">world in which there are concepts</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.289" end="00:32:23.389" style="s2">everywhere that you might be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.269" end="00:32:25.549" style="s2">differently or harvest as a musician say</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.389" end="00:32:29.510" style="s2">you know amateurs borrow professional</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.549" end="00:32:32.120" style="s2">steel and as we try to you know build</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.510" end="00:32:34.429" style="s2">our society to adapt to the crazy rate</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.120" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">of change we have I suspect that one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.429" end="00:32:38.389" style="s2">the best ways to find good piece parts</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:40.039" style="s2">though of course you have to modify them</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.389" end="00:32:41.899" style="s2">for our local conditions is to look what</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.039" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">other people have done right for</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.899" end="00:32:46.909" style="s2">instance I am looking fairly carefully</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:51.019" style="s2">at Sweden amongst other things for two</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.909" end="00:32:54.200" style="s2">things one is their methods of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.019" end="00:32:55.970" style="s2">genders working together in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.200" end="00:32:57.799" style="s2">are kind of probably surprising to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.970" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">of Americans is probably the most gender</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.799" end="00:33:02.870" style="s2">on the stereotyped Society on earth</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.639" style="s2">today and yet you look at you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.870" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">number of men and engineering number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.639" end="00:33:08.360" style="s2">women in nursing they&#39;re actually higher</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.580" style="s2">than they are in the US so what</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.360" end="00:33:13.790" style="s2">to get past gender stereotyping you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.580" end="00:33:16.160" style="s2">let gender reality have its way and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.790" end="00:33:17.870" style="s2">be upset by it the Swedes have also done</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.160" end="00:33:20.929" style="s2">some very interesting and subtle things</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.870" end="00:33:22.970" style="s2">around how they have labor unions you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.929" end="00:33:25.370" style="s2">may well know that like 90% of Swedes</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.970" end="00:33:27.080" style="s2">belong to labor unions but they&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.370" end="00:33:29.299" style="s2">more cooperative and much less</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.080" end="00:33:32.330" style="s2">antagonistic than American and much less</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.299" end="00:33:35.030" style="s2">corrupt than american-style labor unions</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.330" end="00:33:37.370" style="s2">so those two piece parts from Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.030" end="00:33:38.540" style="s2">seem to be ones that at least seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.370" end="00:33:42.500" style="s2">to be good to think about incorporating</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.540" end="00:33:44.510" style="s2">into into other societies yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.500" end="00:33:48.530" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting thing I mean when I</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.510" end="00:33:51.950" style="s2">first came here I really I you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.530" end="00:33:54.290" style="s2">had this idea that this was a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.950" end="00:33:56.510" style="s2">you know as good as it gets for Western</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.290" end="00:33:59.650" style="s2">civilization you know kind of socio</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.510" end="00:34:02.330" style="s2">political systems and I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.650" end="00:34:04.850" style="s2">rethink that now Oh interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.330" end="00:34:06.770" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear about that well one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.850" end="00:34:10.129" style="s2">the things that&#39;s been so interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.770" end="00:34:12.310" style="s2">me has been to see how this because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.129" end="00:34:16.550" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s quite a strong</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.310" end="00:34:19.220" style="s2">social welfare system here and I of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.550" end="00:34:22.970" style="s2">course I grew up as an American kid and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.220" end="00:34:24.710" style="s2">I mean let&#39;s just face it in the States</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.970" end="00:34:26.090" style="s2">you kind of grow up with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.710" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">basically the government&#39;s there to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.090" end="00:34:31.879" style="s2">screw you over it&#39;s not some place you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:34.700" style="s2">go to get help or two it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:34:34.700" end="00:34:40.429" style="s2">you know you pay taxes they buy bombs</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.190" end="00:34:43.369" style="s2">it&#39;s you know so I didn&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.429" end="00:34:47.540" style="s2">warm fuzzy feelings about the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.369" end="00:34:49.790" style="s2">state as a kind of parental body and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.540" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">was difficult for me to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.790" end="00:34:57.650" style="s2">kind of blind what felt very naive trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:34:59.180" style="s2">in this external system but also I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.650" end="00:35:02.450" style="s2">thought well maybe that&#39;s just me</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.180" end="00:35:04.580" style="s2">because you know our our government</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.450" end="00:35:06.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really help you it lets people</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.580" end="00:35:09.220" style="s2">fall through the cracks and leaves them</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.410" end="00:35:12.050" style="s2">on the streets so we see it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.220" end="00:35:15.380" style="s2">but maybe this isn&#39;t different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.050" end="00:35:19.570" style="s2">place and what I started to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.380" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">increasingly was that an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.570" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">phenomenon emerges</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.100" end="00:35:28.850" style="s2">where I&#39;d might have to back up a tad</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:31.640" style="s2">here so prior to the big welfare system</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.850" end="00:35:33.740" style="s2">coming in there was sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.640" end="00:35:38.030" style="s2">oppression of both the family and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.740" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">church and so the public state welfare</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.030" end="00:35:46.070" style="s2">system allowed people to be free of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">sort of the tyranny of the family so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.070" end="00:35:50.810" style="s2">could have another job besides the one</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.410" end="00:35:52.850" style="s2">your father had right and you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.810" end="00:35:54.830" style="s2">marry in a different way enjoy your</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.850" end="00:35:57.230" style="s2">sexuality in a different way that sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.830" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">of thing I have a different religion and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.230" end="00:36:00.650" style="s2">the church as well so there were these</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:03.980" style="s2">two institutions that were holding</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.650" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">people back the state freed them but</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.980" end="00:36:10.450" style="s2">when that happened it that what is so</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:13.130" style="s2">ironic but this notion of an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.450" end="00:36:16.610" style="s2">well-being at a social level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.130" end="00:36:19.910" style="s2">supported by the state actually produces</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.610" end="00:36:22.820" style="s2">a kind of individualism that I never</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.910" end="00:36:25.400" style="s2">would have expected so people don&#39;t turn</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.820" end="00:36:28.940" style="s2">to each other for help they turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.400" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">state and the deep cultural consequences</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.940" end="00:36:34.700" style="s2">of that are really disconcerting you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:38.930" style="s2">know I had a good friend who was dying</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.700" end="00:36:41.690" style="s2">of cancer and the state was offering to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.930" end="00:36:45.740" style="s2">give him care for eleven minutes a day</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.690" end="00:36:48.290" style="s2">and so I turned to all his friends and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.740" end="00:36:50.120" style="s2">family and said okay so this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.290" end="00:36:51.860" style="s2">do we just get together and we take on</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.120" end="00:36:54.410" style="s2">meals and laundry and we you know we</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.860" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">bathing and we take care of him and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.410" end="00:37:00.290" style="s2">looked at me like I had fallen out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:02.660" style="s2">the sky and I couldn&#39;t understand what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.290" end="00:37:04.610" style="s2">had said another one of those cheese</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.660" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">cutter moments right where I was like</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.610" end="00:37:12.200" style="s2">what did I say there was still wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">I had suggested that we behave in what</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.200" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">eyes would have just leaned in to as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:21.140" style="s2">fabric of community and it wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:23.360" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s unfortunate I mean this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.140" end="00:37:25.460" style="s2">trend that&#39;s been noted by some thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.360" end="00:37:28.430" style="s2">is that and it varies a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.460" end="00:37:30.500" style="s2">between the right and the left is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.430" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">what traditionally was done by family</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.500" end="00:37:33.770" style="s2">and community is now done either by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.200" style="s2">state or the mark</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.770" end="00:37:38.330" style="s2">right and you know under more right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:40.100" style="s2">places it happens in the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.330" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">left-wing places more state but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.100" end="00:37:43.430" style="s2">balance between the two</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:46.190" style="s2">but both leave out the organic family</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.430" end="00:37:48.230" style="s2">and community and it&#39;s why I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.190" end="00:37:49.790" style="s2">gotten disgusted by both left and right</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.230" end="00:37:51.890" style="s2">I think that whatever comes next</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.790" end="00:37:54.350" style="s2">whatever replaces what we have today</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.890" end="00:37:56.390" style="s2">really ought to be completely orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.350" end="00:37:58.220" style="s2">to either our current vision of left and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.390" end="00:38:00.530" style="s2">right because they they have missed the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:03.050" style="s2">organic they missed you know the live</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.530" end="00:38:04.970" style="s2">part of what it is to be human and have</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.050" end="00:38:07.100" style="s2">abstracted these functions to the state</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:09.350" style="s2">a perfect example you gave that we know</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.100" end="00:38:11.869" style="s2">why should you know late life care be an</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.350" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">11 minute increments that provided by a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.869" end="00:38:17.210" style="s2">bureaucratic entity rather than being an</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:20.150" style="s2">organic whole offered by the family in</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.210" end="00:38:22.369" style="s2">the community or on the US case oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.150" end="00:38:25.100" style="s2">okay you pay somebody to do this right</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.369" end="00:38:27.590" style="s2">neither of those is what humans really</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.100" end="00:38:29.840" style="s2">want they want conviviality they want</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.590" end="00:38:32.090" style="s2">the organic another example that</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.840" end="00:38:34.100" style="s2">reinforces that is the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.090" end="00:38:35.990" style="s2">United States for all of its somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.100" end="00:38:39.130" style="s2">right-winger II and at least on global</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.990" end="00:38:41.630" style="s2">basis is by far the most philanthropic</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.130" end="00:38:44.210" style="s2">country on Earth when I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.630" end="00:38:46.970" style="s2">Europeans are always amazed at how many</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.210" end="00:38:49.160" style="s2">Americans give money to charity I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.970" end="00:38:50.930" style="s2">and not just rich Americans is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.160" end="00:38:52.790" style="s2">percentage of Americans give a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.930" end="00:38:55.340" style="s2">meaningful percentage of their income to</p>

<p begin="00:38:55.340" end="00:38:59.030" style="s2">to your point sizzle isn&#39;t that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.750" end="00:39:01.070" style="s2">state&#39;s job maybe we have so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.030" end="00:39:03.140" style="s2">philanthropy because our state is less</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.070" end="00:39:05.900" style="s2">broad but on the other hand it provides</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.140" end="00:39:09.050" style="s2">a much richer ecosystem for individual</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.900" end="00:39:10.850" style="s2">decisions of funding decide what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.050" end="00:39:11.900" style="s2">of philanthropy exists rather than</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:16.700" style="s2">bureaucratic approach so and all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.390" end="00:39:20.210" style="s2">these are examples of ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.700" end="00:39:23.210" style="s2">there has been a structure and then the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.210" end="00:39:27.500" style="s2">culture has been in response to these</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.210" end="00:39:30.380" style="s2">various policy structures and this is I</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.500" end="00:39:33.560" style="s2">think an important place to speak into</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.380" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">Jim because you know I&#39;m with you both</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.560" end="00:39:40.460" style="s2">the left and the right are wildly out of</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.460" end="00:39:44.450" style="s2">discussed there&#39;s so much to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.410" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">right now and there&#39;s so little of any</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.450" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">of it happening in the political debates</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">from either side</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.150" style="s2">no one&#39;s talking about the things we</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:55.450" style="s2">actually need to talk about and yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.150" end="00:39:57.579" style="s2">they&#39;re glaring so it&#39;s an issue and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.450" end="00:40:00.099" style="s2">I think this bit that we&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.579" end="00:40:03.250" style="s2">skating along around our whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.099" end="00:40:08.260" style="s2">conversation here of where it is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.250" end="00:40:14.410" style="s2">this mushy systemic sense making process</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.260" end="00:40:18.220" style="s2">is fixing across multiple contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.410" end="00:40:20.289" style="s2">between them and and how it is that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.220" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">go about thinking about who we are in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.289" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">the world were in together because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:30.130" style="s2">don&#39;t do that by myself I do that with</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:33.069" style="s2">you right I do that in my community with</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.130" end="00:40:35.619" style="s2">my family with my kids with my partner</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.069" end="00:40:39.730" style="s2">who am i if I am NOT in in reflection</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.619" end="00:40:42.039" style="s2">and respond right so I you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.730" end="00:40:46.140" style="s2">for me this is a really it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.039" end="00:40:49.930" style="s2">really important topic because so often</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.140" end="00:40:51.970" style="s2">when we do get to that blessed moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.930" end="00:40:54.099" style="s2">where we get to talk about complexity</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.970" end="00:40:55.770" style="s2">and in terms of these things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.099" end="00:40:58.740" style="s2">dealing with whether it&#39;s economic</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.740" end="00:41:07.299" style="s2">exploitation or any of those things it</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.260" end="00:41:11.609" style="s2">gets flattened again into a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.299" end="00:41:14.559" style="s2">map of separated time constrained</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.609" end="00:41:17.650" style="s2">processes that are sort of in an</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.559" end="00:41:21.579" style="s2">illustration like an engineering design</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.650" end="00:41:24.670" style="s2">and the real sort of the juice of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.579" end="00:41:27.190" style="s2">falls out and then we have these</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.670" end="00:41:31.210" style="s2">responses which of course are human</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.190" end="00:41:35.349" style="s2">responses they are are non-verbal cheese</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.210" end="00:41:37.779" style="s2">cutter type confusions and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.349" end="00:41:40.569" style="s2">so much of what we&#39;re faced with right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.779" end="00:41:42.789" style="s2">now is confusions that are compounded</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.819" end="00:42:00.600" style="s2">think is the game B&#39;s that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.529" end="00:42:02.940" style="s2">to figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.600" end="00:42:04.500" style="s2">right that&#39;s the thing yeah I resonate</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.940" end="00:42:06.450" style="s2">with that cuz you&#39;ve said centuries-old</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.500" end="00:42:09.870" style="s2">and you know one of the one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.450" end="00:42:12.300" style="s2">holdings of game B is that it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.870" end="00:42:15.120" style="s2">comes after game a which we think to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.300" end="00:42:16.680" style="s2">centuries old and has you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.120" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">entrenched itself in the in these</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.680" end="00:42:21.300" style="s2">grooves of a whole lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.220" style="s2">are producing things like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.300" end="00:42:24.930" style="s2">transitions from family and community</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.220" end="00:42:27.150" style="s2">the state and economy and for what</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.930" end="00:42:29.550" style="s2">seemed like good reasons at the time but</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.150" end="00:42:33.240" style="s2">we end up with such an alienating way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.550" end="00:42:35.700" style="s2">life right and I think the the core idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.240" end="00:42:38.250" style="s2">of game B is how can we solve these</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.700" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">existential risk problems that game a is</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.250" end="00:42:42.260" style="s2">created like powerful powerful genetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:44.970" style="s2">engineering with God knows what</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.260" end="00:42:46.950" style="s2">consequences climate change nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.970" end="00:42:49.500" style="s2">weapons how can we do that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.950" end="00:42:52.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lead us to the uber dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.500" end="00:42:56.010" style="s2">but rather a return to stronger emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.920" end="00:42:59.430" style="s2">on the organic on the networked on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.010" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">non-hierarchical you know and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.430" end="00:43:02.850" style="s2">like all of us were kind of who would</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:04.140" style="s2">look at game be we go what is it no one</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.850" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">quite knows what it is yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.140" end="00:43:09.210" style="s2">at least we know what it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">status quo and we know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.210" end="00:43:13.800" style="s2">attributes of it and it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.910" end="00:43:16.020" style="s2">interesting and fun thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.800" end="00:43:17.850" style="s2">exploring and necessary it strikes me if</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.020" end="00:43:19.890" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna you know you know to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.850" end="00:43:22.500" style="s2">back a little bit more seriously game a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.890" end="00:43:24.690" style="s2">seems to me to be driving off various</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.500" end="00:43:26.850" style="s2">cliffs all at the same time it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.690" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">pretty serious situation and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.850" end="00:43:31.890" style="s2">places I&#39;m seeing this game a game be if</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:33.810" style="s2">you want to call it that which you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:37.770" style="s2">I&#39;m fine that&#39;s fun let&#39;s call it that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.810" end="00:43:39.450" style="s2">is between generations so you asked me</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.770" end="00:43:42.120" style="s2">at the beginning of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.450" end="00:43:44.460" style="s2">about my relationship to the generations</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.120" end="00:43:47.310" style="s2">that came before me and I said we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.460" end="00:43:52.110" style="s2">talk about that for an hour and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.310" end="00:43:54.690" style="s2">something about being alive that has</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.110" end="00:43:57.810" style="s2">something to do with the fact that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.690" end="00:44:00.330" style="s2">we&#39;re just fibers between generations</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.810" end="00:44:03.210" style="s2">and you show up with everything you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.330" end="00:44:05.400" style="s2">got and you offer whatever shine you</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.210" end="00:44:07.260" style="s2">have the Jim shine the Nora shine</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.400" end="00:44:08.890" style="s2">whatever I have to give whether I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.260" end="00:44:11.500" style="s2">musician or a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.890" end="00:44:14.320" style="s2">you know what paper maker or a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.500" end="00:44:18.520" style="s2">or a mom or whatever it is I have that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.320" end="00:44:20.860" style="s2">the thing I want I&#39;m bound to give that</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.520" end="00:44:22.900" style="s2">I learned something from the generation</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.860" end="00:44:24.670" style="s2">that came before and I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.900" end="00:44:27.100" style="s2">something to the generation that comes</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.670" end="00:44:31.510" style="s2">after and at the end of it all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.100" end="00:44:34.890" style="s2">pretty much all you got and for me I had</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.510" end="00:44:38.320" style="s2">to really do the work to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.890" end="00:44:41.710" style="s2">recognition when I was making that film</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.320" end="00:44:45.850" style="s2">about my dad I had to figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.710" end="00:44:48.460" style="s2">am I in this generational mess and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.850" end="00:44:50.110" style="s2">the lineages were not just linear they</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.460" end="00:44:52.870" style="s2">were going forward and backward and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.110" end="00:44:55.810" style="s2">circling and they were you know weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.870" end="00:44:58.510" style="s2">and curly and unfathomable and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.810" end="00:45:02.110" style="s2">surprising and I they were outside of my</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.510" end="00:45:08.230" style="s2">capacity to articulate them and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.110" end="00:45:11.020" style="s2">recognizing a pattern of a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.230" end="00:45:15.070" style="s2">in the sort of age range of I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.020" end="00:45:18.580" style="s2">they&#39;re young but up to about 27 28 that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.070" end="00:45:21.910" style="s2">are really questioning what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.580" end="00:45:26.020" style="s2">to be a good person how do I be a good</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.910" end="00:45:28.270" style="s2">person how do I show up what what is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.020" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">life goal like what how are they</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.270" end="00:45:32.980" style="s2">supposed to even think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:35.700" style="s2">is and for you and me we didn&#39;t grow up</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.980" end="00:45:38.590" style="s2">in a world where the future was so</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.700" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">obscured as it is now</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.590" end="00:45:43.870" style="s2">I don&#39;t know remember remember we grew</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">up under the shadow of the bomb all</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.870" end="00:45:49.690" style="s2">right I grew up in a DC suburb seven</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:52.330" style="s2">miles from the White House and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.690" end="00:45:53.740" style="s2">we thought there was a 50-50 chance we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.330" end="00:45:57.310" style="s2">all be dead by the time we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.740" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">teenagers I know but it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.310" end="00:46:01.510" style="s2">because I mean partially it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:03.610" style="s2">biodiversity issue and there&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.510" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">sort of like well no matter what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.610" end="00:46:08.290" style="s2">not gonna be like this game a is done</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">yeah certainly seems like it to me and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.290" end="00:46:16.570" style="s2">so how to not placate or console people</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:20.170" style="s2">who are asking that question with dumb</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.570" end="00:46:21.670" style="s2">memes and to actually ensure that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.170" end="00:46:25.089" style="s2">the complexity of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.670" end="00:46:28.359" style="s2">question and those relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.089" end="00:46:30.790" style="s2">integrity and with the a sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.359" end="00:46:32.619" style="s2">know our own complexity on board you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.790" end="00:46:34.599" style="s2">know this is not that thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.619" end="00:46:36.339" style="s2">just say oh honey you just follow your</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.599" end="00:46:38.470" style="s2">dreams or you can do what you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.339" end="00:46:40.510" style="s2">or you know don&#39;t take the world on your</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.470" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">shoulders or you just you know if this</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.510" end="00:46:46.660" style="s2">is not that these kids have they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:48.700" style="s2">the math they get it it&#39;s over and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.660" end="00:46:51.190" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to place themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.700" end="00:46:55.240" style="s2">or how to be a good person in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.190" end="00:46:59.109" style="s2">structures of our systems if there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.829" end="00:47:30.460" style="s2">kind of life is that you know to spend</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.569" end="00:47:43.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed it a very weird way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.059" end="00:47:45.910" style="s2">life that is also on a race to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.270" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">extinction and as you say at least a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.910" end="00:47:50.470" style="s2">bigger number than ever before young</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:52.750" style="s2">folks have now done the math sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.470" end="00:47:54.460" style="s2">to get the math wrong I keep hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.750" end="00:47:57.609" style="s2">world will end in 12 years which is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.460" end="00:48:00.010" style="s2">lot wrong but at least they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.609" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">sense of where the vector is pointing</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.010" end="00:48:04.359" style="s2">better than a lot of other people have</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">before yeah so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.359" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">intergenerational question and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">that this territory is a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:14.109" style="s2">interesting territory for if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:16.359" style="s2">systems change that&#39;s lurking somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.109" end="00:48:19.780" style="s2">in the notion of game B that I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.359" end="00:48:22.930" style="s2">that that intergenerational zone is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.780" end="00:48:26.589" style="s2">very potent realm of possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.930" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">has really yet to be explored in as much</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.589" end="00:48:31.329" style="s2">as it could be and it&#39;s been interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:34.359" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been in circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.329" end="00:48:35.620" style="s2">recently where I&#39;ve heard you know young</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.359" end="00:48:38.530" style="s2">people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.620" end="00:48:42.070" style="s2">but this is actually really bad and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.530" end="00:48:43.960" style="s2">seen the the boomers in the room jump up</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.070" end="00:48:45.940" style="s2">to try to make it better all you got to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.960" end="00:48:49.330" style="s2">do is Aikido it or you got to do this or</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.940" end="00:48:52.750" style="s2">you got to do that and just watched how</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.330" end="00:48:55.510" style="s2">all those efforts to console and placate</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.750" end="00:48:57.340" style="s2">and make that young person feel better I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.510" end="00:48:59.770" style="s2">hate saying that were a young person by</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.340" end="00:49:03.970" style="s2">the way that&#39;s a really yucky word just</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.770" end="00:49:07.420" style="s2">isolated them just left them alone in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.970" end="00:49:12.100" style="s2">the issue and so I would be interested</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.420" end="00:49:13.960" style="s2">in exploring that more because when we</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.100" end="00:49:17.190" style="s2">start to think about what&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.960" end="00:49:21.790" style="s2">social and cultural connective tissue</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.190" end="00:49:23.710" style="s2">these under articulated expectations and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.790" end="00:49:26.860" style="s2">patterns of communication between the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.710" end="00:49:28.750" style="s2">generations are so strong for</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.860" end="00:49:31.090" style="s2">continuance right so if we want</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.750" end="00:49:34.810" style="s2">discontinuance I think we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.090" end="00:49:37.450" style="s2">there on the other hand if we look back</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.810" end="00:49:38.890" style="s2">at say this the mild discontinued that</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.450" end="00:49:42.460" style="s2">came out of the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.890" end="00:49:45.130" style="s2">it basically arose almost endogenously</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.460" end="00:49:47.620" style="s2">from the baby boomers it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.130" end="00:49:50.380" style="s2">wasn&#39;t negotiated with the silence and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.620" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">the GI Joes the boomers just did it with</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.380" end="00:49:55.030" style="s2">a lot of inspiration from the older</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">silence and I hope that the Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.030" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">and Zoomers decide to do the same hey</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:02.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason boomers are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:05.590" style="s2">rigid we&#39;re old goddammit that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.020" end="00:50:07.510" style="s2">people make it all and so you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.590" end="00:50:10.060" style="s2">try to convince the boomers just</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.510" end="00:50:11.560" style="s2">do it that&#39;s the advice I&#39;d give to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.060" end="00:50:14.170" style="s2">zoo person by the way there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.560" end="00:50:16.060" style="s2">us boomers out there who are are</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.170" end="00:50:18.220" style="s2">listening and trying to understand which</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.060" end="00:50:20.350" style="s2">is going on and can be allies but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.220" end="00:50:22.450" style="s2">not our job it&#39;s your job kids you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.350" end="00:50:24.550" style="s2">the new generation we kick the asses of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.450" end="00:50:26.350" style="s2">the earlier generations it&#39;s your turn</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.550" end="00:50:28.600" style="s2">to kick our ass goddammit</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.350" end="00:50:30.790" style="s2">yeah and I think though that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.600" end="00:50:33.130" style="s2">in the relationship between generations</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.790" end="00:50:36.760" style="s2">because one of the things that happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.130" end="00:50:40.300" style="s2">was of course you know the boomers had</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.760" end="00:50:42.880" style="s2">to join the system and they did and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.300" end="00:50:46.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t really make as much change as one</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.880" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">had hoped it didn&#39;t some areas it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.600" end="00:50:51.000" style="s2">so yeah think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:54.069" style="s2">you know gay rights what unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.000" end="00:50:56.460" style="s2">change has been since when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.069" end="00:50:59.170" style="s2">were you know the idea of working-class</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.460" end="00:51:01.420" style="s2">redneck America you know something</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.170" end="00:51:03.099" style="s2">coming yeah we might know what it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.420" end="00:51:05.140" style="s2">and doing like we&#39;re in high school and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.099" end="00:51:07.289" style="s2">when we did sort of vaguely have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.140" end="00:51:10.660" style="s2">it was like the worst thing imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.289" end="00:51:13.089" style="s2">to now or you know the even conservative</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.660" end="00:51:15.670" style="s2">people are pretty much at ease with it</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.089" end="00:51:18.190" style="s2">and gay marriage is legal all happening</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.670" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">in like 50 years quite astounding you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.190" end="00:51:23.500" style="s2">know it&#39;s one of the obvious fruits of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">the 60s huge progress on civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.500" end="00:51:29.049" style="s2">no not solved by any means and probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:31.510" style="s2">the most important one I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.049" end="00:51:33.309" style="s2">one of my little self quotes which I</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.510" end="00:51:35.769" style="s2">liked which I like to say when the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.309" end="00:51:38.319" style="s2">historians from a thousand years ago who</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.769" end="00:51:41.049" style="s2">looked back at the 20th century it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.319" end="00:51:43.779" style="s2">be the great world wars it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.049" end="00:51:45.069" style="s2">nuclear power it won&#39;t be landing on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.779" end="00:51:46.599" style="s2">moon it won&#39;t even be the internet</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.069" end="00:51:50.619" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna be the highlight of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.599" end="00:51:53.220" style="s2">20th century is around 1975 the wave</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.619" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">finally turned towards the true</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.220" end="00:51:59.500" style="s2">emancipation of women after 12,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:02.349" style="s2">at least of hardcore patriarchy in most</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.500" end="00:52:05.019" style="s2">parts of the world and again that change</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.349" end="00:52:08.680" style="s2">has happened unbelievably rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.019" end="00:52:10.210" style="s2">again driven by boomer at least boomer</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.680" end="00:52:12.369" style="s2">accelerated because obviously these</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.210" end="00:52:15.490" style="s2">trends go back into the 19th century but</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.369" end="00:52:18.279" style="s2">gigantic boost of energy from boomer</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.490" end="00:52:20.170" style="s2">free thinking and hey now it&#39;s time for</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.279" end="00:52:22.660" style="s2">the younger generations to do something</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.170" end="00:52:25.750" style="s2">similar it&#39;s interesting because when I</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.660" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">was a kid Jim I was at these dinner</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.750" end="00:52:31.779" style="s2">tables you know with all these people</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:33.670" style="s2">and what gives me the spooks is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.779" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">they were having conversations that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.670" end="00:52:41.470" style="s2">so much like the ones we&#39;re having right</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:44.740" style="s2">now and I&#39;m 51 so that was you know 76</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.470" end="00:52:48.940" style="s2">78 that was a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.740" end="00:52:51.789" style="s2">it&#39;s 40 years ago and the changes that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.940" end="00:52:54.849" style="s2">needed to get made there were they</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.789" end="00:52:57.579" style="s2">weren&#39;t really possible to get at and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.849" end="00:52:59.529" style="s2">think so more and more you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.579" end="00:53:00.790" style="s2">been playing with this idea of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.529" end="00:53:04.180" style="s2">thing called warm day</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.790" end="00:53:06.970" style="s2">right and one of the sort of theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.180" end="00:53:09.340" style="s2">pieces inside the warm data idea which</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.970" end="00:53:12.760" style="s2">is basically asking the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.340" end="00:53:16.870" style="s2">is information if you look at a complex</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.760" end="00:53:20.410" style="s2">system of complex living system from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.870" end="00:53:22.590" style="s2">trans contextual perspective what is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.410" end="00:53:26.200" style="s2">information how does the information</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.590" end="00:53:28.510" style="s2">look smell walk talk feel how is it</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.200" end="00:53:32.050" style="s2">expressed what do you do with it because</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.510" end="00:53:34.630" style="s2">of course these it&#39;s not still it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.050" end="00:53:37.000" style="s2">to define if you pull it out of context</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.630" end="00:53:38.920" style="s2">you can do all sorts of things but if</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.000" end="00:53:41.650" style="s2">you don&#39;t pull things out of their</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.920" end="00:53:41.950" style="s2">contexts they are really hard to pin</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.650" end="00:53:46.170" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.950" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">and yet that capacity for perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.170" end="00:53:50.920" style="s2">complex living systems seems to me an</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:54.970" style="s2">interdependency seems to be to be one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.920" end="00:53:58.330" style="s2">the most important steps to word getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.970" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">to game B as to generate as much</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.330" end="00:54:04.390" style="s2">experience as possible with as many</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:07.390" style="s2">people as possible around perceiving in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.390" end="00:54:09.370" style="s2">an interdependent way I stumbled across</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.390" end="00:54:11.770" style="s2">this concept of warm data all I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.370" end="00:54:14.200" style="s2">doing the research for this podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.770" end="00:54:17.230" style="s2">it intrigued me but it&#39;s by no means</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.200" end="00:54:18.790" style="s2">clear to me what it is and it may be</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.230" end="00:54:20.950" style="s2">that it&#39;s just too early to have a crisp</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.790" end="00:54:23.710" style="s2">definition but can you at least try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.950" end="00:54:26.950" style="s2">put some parentheses around it hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.710" end="00:54:29.500" style="s2">mean basically the definition is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.950" end="00:54:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s trans contextual information about</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.500" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">the relationships that are part of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.040" end="00:54:37.630" style="s2">complex system and so it&#39;s just looking</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:41.080" style="s2">at how they are when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.630" end="00:54:44.070" style="s2">relationship so it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.080" end="00:54:47.020" style="s2">measure things when they&#39;re changing and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.070" end="00:54:49.000" style="s2">if you pull them out of context you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.020" end="00:54:51.400" style="s2">measure them but when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.000" end="00:54:54.310" style="s2">multiple contexts simultaneously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.400" end="00:54:58.150" style="s2">difficult so it becomes very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.310" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">to identify and define and to lock down</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.150" end="00:55:02.080" style="s2">and to repeat experiments and all those</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:04.440" style="s2">things that were the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.080" end="00:55:07.510" style="s2">benefits of the Scientific Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.440" end="00:55:09.370" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t really work when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.510" end="00:55:12.700" style="s2">want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.370" end="00:55:14.260" style="s2">family you can chart the data on each</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.700" end="00:55:15.730" style="s2">person but it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.260" end="00:55:17.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s the family is in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.730" end="00:55:20.560" style="s2">relationship between them and their</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.500" end="00:55:24.010" style="s2">dynamic right yeah they&#39;re exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.560" end="00:55:27.700" style="s2">that would be the warm data so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.010" end="00:55:29.710" style="s2">the the issue is you know what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.700" end="00:55:32.490" style="s2">information are we using what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.710" end="00:55:35.140" style="s2">prioritized and how do we begin to share</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.490" end="00:55:37.300" style="s2">that with each other but as I started</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.140" end="00:55:40.540" style="s2">working with warm data I developed this</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.300" end="00:55:42.490" style="s2">thing called a warm data lab and in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.540" end="00:55:45.850" style="s2">warm data lab you have a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.490" end="00:55:49.180" style="s2">and they explore a question that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.850" end="00:55:51.700" style="s2">involves a complex system so you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.180" end="00:55:54.820" style="s2">ask the question for example like what</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.700" end="00:55:56.440" style="s2">is health in a changing world okay and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.820" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of contexts that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.440" end="00:56:01.690" style="s2">involved in that question it could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:04.300" style="s2">any canonic context there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.690" end="00:56:08.700" style="s2">technology culture family politics</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.300" end="00:56:11.470" style="s2">history technology art even there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.700" end="00:56:14.740" style="s2">sexuality there&#39;s all sorts of contexts</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.470" end="00:56:17.160" style="s2">right so the way it works is you have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.740" end="00:56:20.350" style="s2">group of people in a room and they are</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.160" end="00:56:22.810" style="s2">exploring this question and all those</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.350" end="00:56:24.610" style="s2">contexts are laid out like at different</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.810" end="00:56:26.320" style="s2">groupings of chairs and then people just</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.610" end="00:56:28.030" style="s2">kind of move whenever they want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.320" end="00:56:31.060" style="s2">between the chairs so they might start</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.030" end="00:56:33.100" style="s2">off talking about health in a changing</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.060" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">world through the context of education</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.100" end="00:56:38.500" style="s2">and then whenever they want to they move</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">to another place I mean health through</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.500" end="00:56:41.590" style="s2">the context of economy in a changing</p>

<p begin="00:56:46.180" end="00:56:50.800" style="s2">something and each time they move they</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.270" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">meet new people they&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.800" end="00:56:55.120" style="s2">different stories they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:57.430" style="s2">talking across multiple textures of</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.120" end="00:56:59.290" style="s2">communication so there&#39;s family stories</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.430" end="00:57:02.200" style="s2">there&#39;s memories there&#39;s professional</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.290" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">knowledge there&#39;s jokes there&#39;s songs</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.200" end="00:57:05.940" style="s2">they&#39;re in whatever it is that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:08.500" style="s2">in that particular group which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.940" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">infinitely random as far as I can figure</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.500" end="00:57:15.850" style="s2">out and what happens is after they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:19.450" style="s2">changed contexts a few times they start</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.850" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">to have the experience of the</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.099" end="00:57:29.759" style="s2">by adjusting any of the particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.410" end="00:57:31.739" style="s2">contexts and how one then goes about</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.759" end="00:57:35.450" style="s2">contributing to the health of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.739" end="00:57:38.309" style="s2">community or nation or city or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.450" end="00:57:40.890" style="s2">becomes a very different question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.309" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">totally different order of experience in</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.890" end="00:57:45.869" style="s2">that room where you have from about 12</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:47.609" style="s2">to about 400 different people in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.869" end="00:57:50.339" style="s2">room who have experienced that inter</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.609" end="00:57:52.019" style="s2">dependency asking that question so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.339" end="00:57:53.700" style="s2">pretty cool and I&#39;m really enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.019" end="00:57:55.890" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with it it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.700" end="00:57:58.910" style="s2">adopted by lots of people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.890" end="00:58:02.910" style="s2">becoming a sort of a form of developing</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.910" end="00:58:05.609" style="s2">community around discovering inter</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.910" end="00:58:07.979" style="s2">dependency which is interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.609" end="00:58:10.499" style="s2">unpredictable where it will go by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.979" end="00:58:12.809" style="s2">way because I never know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.499" end="00:58:15.210" style="s2">come out of these things and where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.809" end="00:58:17.819" style="s2">where the consequences will bubble up I</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.210" end="00:58:20.700" style="s2">just never know but what I wanted to get</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.819" end="00:58:23.519" style="s2">at was actually a theoretical piece of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.700" end="00:58:28.019" style="s2">this which is a I think where I want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.519" end="00:58:29.940" style="s2">talk with you so I started there listing</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.019" end="00:58:32.819" style="s2">all the theoretical properties of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.940" end="00:58:35.880" style="s2">process and of course it includes you</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.819" end="00:58:39.420" style="s2">know requisite variety it includes auto</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.880" end="00:58:41.130" style="s2">places it includes patterns that connect</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.420" end="00:58:44.069" style="s2">it includes difference that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.130" end="00:58:45.690" style="s2">difference it includes skismo genesis</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.069" end="00:58:47.819" style="s2">and all these different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.690" end="00:58:51.269" style="s2">theoretical models are inside this</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.819" end="00:58:53.309" style="s2">process but one of them that has been</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.269" end="00:58:57.509" style="s2">really interesting to me lately</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.309" end="00:59:02.849" style="s2">is this notion of abduction by which I</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.509" end="00:59:06.839" style="s2">do not mean stealing children I I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.849" end="00:59:08.989" style="s2">the person meaning right yeah well and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.839" end="00:59:13.469" style="s2">how the person meaning got kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.989" end="00:59:16.589" style="s2">literally abducted by my dad and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.469" end="00:59:20.279" style="s2">this idea that were you know we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.589" end="00:59:23.789" style="s2">one context to make sense of another so</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.279" end="00:59:26.369" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re getting so stuck is when the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.789" end="00:59:30.299" style="s2">sense making around a particular</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.369" end="00:59:32.670" style="s2">experience is formed across and through</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.299" end="00:59:36.390" style="s2">and within multiple contextual</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.670" end="00:59:40.109" style="s2">experiences of language of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.390" end="00:59:42.930" style="s2">education of you know money of science</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.109" end="00:59:46.819" style="s2">of culture of all kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.930" end="00:59:50.730" style="s2">are wreaking firming and affirming and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.819" end="00:59:54.210" style="s2">materializing various sense making forms</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.730" end="00:59:56.339" style="s2">so we you know we&#39;re learning to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.210" end="01:00:00.180" style="s2">sense of the health system through the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.339" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">education system we&#39;re learning to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.180" end="01:00:03.630" style="s2">sense of the education system and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:07.650" style="s2">health system through the economic</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.630" end="01:00:12.210" style="s2">system so there&#39;s deeply steeped</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.650" end="01:00:13.920" style="s2">together and and kind of imprint it in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.210" end="01:00:16.260" style="s2">kind of if you thought of it as a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.920" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">of sponges with paint like if all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.260" end="01:00:22.490" style="s2">paint would be mixed together because</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:26.609" style="s2">you can&#39;t actually pull it apart anymore</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.490" end="01:00:30.180" style="s2">so I&#39;m finding this notion of abduction</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.609" end="01:00:34.519" style="s2">to be really an interesting piece and to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.180" end="01:00:37.410" style="s2">get down into that place where the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.519" end="01:00:41.400" style="s2">abductive process of sense making across</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.410" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">different contexts is where the matrix</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.400" end="01:00:46.730" style="s2">has got us and how we begin to sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:49.259" style="s2">make across multiple contexts</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.730" end="01:00:51.930" style="s2">simultaneously in this moment that seems</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.259" end="01:00:54.839" style="s2">to me to be really important just in you</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.930" end="01:00:57.569" style="s2">raises we just had a major conference at</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.839" end="01:01:00.299" style="s2">the Santa Fe Institute on the new</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.569" end="01:01:03.329" style="s2">economics what comes after status quo</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.299" end="01:01:05.789" style="s2">economics and it&#39;s a narrower field than</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.329" end="01:01:08.279" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about but we&#39;ve had some</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.789" end="01:01:12.390" style="s2">very similar issues and concerns which</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.279" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">is you know formal university PhD</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.390" end="01:01:17.369" style="s2">economics is basically applied math</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:20.069" style="s2">right and the reality is an economic</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.369" end="01:01:22.440" style="s2">system has got way more dimensionality</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.069" end="01:01:24.299" style="s2">that you can possibly explore in plain</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.440" end="01:01:27.509" style="s2">old math at least other than in toy</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.299" end="01:01:30.599" style="s2">problems and so the question the group</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.509" end="01:01:32.940" style="s2">was pushing on was what tools do we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.599" end="01:01:34.890" style="s2">to look at high dimensional interactions</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.940" end="01:01:38.069" style="s2">right that are frankly beyond our</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.890" end="01:01:40.440" style="s2">intellectual ability to process I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.069" end="01:01:42.180" style="s2">can&#39;t think about what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.440" end="01:01:43.589" style="s2">when there&#39;s nine different dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.180" end="01:01:45.960" style="s2">of interaction all of which are</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.589" end="01:01:49.109" style="s2">important and you know all this may</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.960" end="01:01:50.080" style="s2">sound very prosaic I think the lead idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.109" end="01:01:52.810" style="s2">that came out of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.080" end="01:01:56.170" style="s2">meeting was to kind of reinvigorate an</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.810" end="01:01:58.840" style="s2">older idea which was simulation through</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.170" end="01:02:01.510" style="s2">agent-based modeling where we actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.840" end="01:02:03.940" style="s2">we can create software agents that say</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.510" end="01:02:06.430" style="s2">exemplify all nine forces that are</p>

<p begin="01:02:17.260" end="01:02:20.950" style="s2">to find some rules that seem plausible</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.030" end="01:02:23.250" style="s2">enough to throw a bunch of them you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.950" end="01:02:25.840" style="s2">literally millions in some cases into a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.250" end="01:02:27.790" style="s2">agent-based modeling framework and let</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.840" end="01:02:30.040" style="s2">them interact and see what emerges</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.790" end="01:02:31.180" style="s2">because I think the you know the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.040" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">that&#39;s really really hard about these</p>

<p begin="01:03:01.450" end="01:03:05.500" style="s2">handbook for people that want to do warm</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.160" end="01:03:08.410" style="s2">data well I&#39;ve been doing these this</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.500" end="01:03:10.150" style="s2">warm data labs all over the world and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.410" end="01:03:12.220" style="s2">would be so fun to come and do them at</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.150" end="01:03:14.170" style="s2">Santa Fe I think you guys would love it</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.220" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">yeah what we should talk about that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.170" end="01:03:19.150" style="s2">then maybe we can also engage somebody</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:21.490" style="s2">to help you reduce it to practice so</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.150" end="01:03:23.650" style="s2">that others can use it you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.490" end="01:03:25.690" style="s2">the not too much talked about at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.650" end="01:03:29.050" style="s2">moment but in the original game be world</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.690" end="01:03:31.630" style="s2">we had a concept called X in a box where</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.050" end="01:03:34.300" style="s2">X could be anything and the idea was to</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.630" end="01:03:37.020" style="s2">find tools that many people would have</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.300" end="01:03:40.030" style="s2">used for and reduce them to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.020" end="01:03:41.710" style="s2">customizable formula say a handbook for</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.030" end="01:03:43.900" style="s2">doing a warm data lab you use it for any</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.710" end="01:03:47.050" style="s2">kind of high dimensional abductive</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.900" end="01:03:50.050" style="s2">process and you know get that out into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.050" end="01:03:51.970" style="s2">form that&#39;s a live document where not</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.050" end="01:03:54.700" style="s2">only can you as the inventor of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.970" end="01:03:56.320" style="s2">continue to improve your handbook but</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.700" end="01:03:58.180" style="s2">you can interact with people that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.320" end="01:04:00.820" style="s2">using it in the field and you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.180" end="01:04:02.710" style="s2">from their experiences as the community</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.820" end="01:04:05.920" style="s2">together tries to improve this</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.710" end="01:04:08.770" style="s2">well I have started a training course</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.920" end="01:04:11.890" style="s2">because I actually felt like the hosts</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.770" end="01:04:14.140" style="s2">needed to be able to see it working they</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.890" end="01:04:15.940" style="s2">needed to be able to see the patterns it</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.140" end="01:04:19.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if the participants have</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.940" end="01:04:21.730" style="s2">it I mean I I actually kids use warm</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.630" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">data politicians are using warm data</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.730" end="01:04:27.490" style="s2">it&#39;s going into communities and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:29.500" style="s2">vulnerable cities it&#39;s in Asia it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.490" end="01:04:30.820" style="s2">Australia it&#39;s in Pittsburgh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.500" end="01:04:33.400" style="s2">popping up everywhere it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.820" end="01:04:37.210" style="s2">exciting and I have trained more than</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.400" end="01:04:40.860" style="s2">200 hosts now and but it&#39;s it&#39;s a course</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.210" end="01:04:44.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a hardcore you know I like rigor I</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.860" end="01:04:47.830" style="s2">like to go down into the territory</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.530" end="01:04:50.740" style="s2">beyond where we have conscious verbal</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.830" end="01:04:54.310" style="s2">intellectual control but I like rigor</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.740" end="01:04:56.440" style="s2">before I go there so it&#39;s about a five</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.310" end="01:04:58.060" style="s2">day course and it&#39;s a great course</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.440" end="01:05:01.840" style="s2">because you can start to see all of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.060" end="01:05:03.820" style="s2">these processes alive in the lab because</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.840" end="01:05:05.920" style="s2">otherwise people make they make weird</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.820" end="01:05:08.020" style="s2">sort of errors of logical type they</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.920" end="01:05:10.390" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand about how the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.020" end="01:05:12.940" style="s2">abduction is working they don&#39;t so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.390" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">house kind of needs to know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.940" end="01:05:17.650" style="s2">down but the participants don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:19.480" style="s2">know anything to take part of it they</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.650" end="01:05:21.100" style="s2">can just take part of any level I</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.480" end="01:05:24.010" style="s2">probably be better if they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.100" end="01:05:26.020" style="s2">how the apparatus works right because</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.010" end="01:05:27.970" style="s2">you&#39;ll buy us their behaviors I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.020" end="01:05:30.610" style="s2">always do it one of the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.970" end="01:05:32.740" style="s2">instructions that as the host you always</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.610" end="01:05:36.910" style="s2">join it&#39;s not a facilitation</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.740" end="01:05:39.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a hosted thing so I always join the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.910" end="01:05:42.100" style="s2">labs and meet everybody and go in and</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.670" end="01:05:45.640" style="s2">it&#39;s I always learn something every time</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.100" end="01:05:48.970" style="s2">I learn so much this was the big piece</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.640" end="01:05:53.110" style="s2">for me gem was that what I learned doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.970" end="01:05:56.680" style="s2">these labs is this that complexity is</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.110" end="01:05:59.350" style="s2">something much more intimate than I</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.680" end="01:06:02.350" style="s2">thought and it&#39;s interesting because I</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.350" end="01:06:05.230" style="s2">actually am one of the few people in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.350" end="01:06:08.980" style="s2">world who grew up with it in my</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.230" end="01:06:11.170" style="s2">breakfast cereal right so if that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.980" end="01:06:12.940" style="s2">I wrote small arts the way I wrote it</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.170" end="01:06:14.740" style="s2">was I figured everybody else out there</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.940" end="01:06:16.180" style="s2">can write a book about systems and</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.740" end="01:06:20.710" style="s2">complexity but what</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.180" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">I have been blessed with if you will is</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.710" end="01:06:29.050" style="s2">that for me these theories were way of</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:32.290" style="s2">life and I was always taught to perceive</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.050" end="01:06:35.859" style="s2">the complexity in life in daily living</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.290" end="01:06:39.400" style="s2">in the interaction with anyone and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.859" end="01:06:41.710" style="s2">anything that I was around and so it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.400" end="01:06:45.010" style="s2">interesting that even for me this was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.710" end="01:06:48.400" style="s2">surprise but what I learned was that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.010" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">had been teaching courses on complexity</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.400" end="01:06:53.619" style="s2">and systems thinking for you know a long</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:57.250" style="s2">time a decade or something and I never</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.619" end="01:06:59.500" style="s2">got the results ever that I got when I</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.250" end="01:07:01.690" style="s2">did an hour-long warm day to lab people</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.500" end="01:07:04.210" style="s2">came out the other side and they got it</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.690" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">they understood inter dependency because</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.210" end="01:07:09.700" style="s2">it was attached to their own memories it</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:12.599" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a map on the wall or a structure</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.700" end="01:07:15.250" style="s2">or new jargon it was something that was</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.599" end="01:07:18.130" style="s2">abducting their memories across multiple</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.250" end="01:07:20.050" style="s2">contexts and reconnecting the way they</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.130" end="01:07:23.849" style="s2">were seeing the world at a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.050" end="01:07:29.170" style="s2">level and it had nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.849" end="01:07:31.450" style="s2">abstraction it was absolutely inside the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.170" end="01:07:35.619" style="s2">experience of being human through</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.450" end="01:07:37.450" style="s2">another window if you will yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.619" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">it actually gets around the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.450" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">the agent-based model which it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:43.390" style="s2">abstract this is attention doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:45.700" style="s2">something similar to high dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.390" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">abduction without the abstraction yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.700" end="01:07:52.839" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t abstract at all and I just had</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">a 13 year old kid who I went through the</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.839" end="01:08:00.309" style="s2">training process she did a lab with her</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:02.380" style="s2">class in Australia and she said the kids</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.309" end="01:08:05.980" style="s2">just loved it they wanted to do it all</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.380" end="01:08:08.140" style="s2">day long and they did a warm day to lab</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.980" end="01:08:11.829" style="s2">one the question of what is food in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.140" end="01:08:14.829" style="s2">changing world and they had about eleven</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.829" end="01:08:16.540" style="s2">contexts and they just went to every</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.829" end="01:08:18.489" style="s2">single one and they were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.540" end="01:08:20.620" style="s2">food and economy and talking about food</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.489" end="01:08:23.109" style="s2">and history and connecting it to their</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.620" end="01:08:26.650" style="s2">families and their own preferences and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.109" end="01:08:29.480" style="s2">their experiences and their incredible</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.650" end="01:08:32.450" style="s2">if little kids can do it and people in</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.480" end="01:08:41.660" style="s2">cities are doing yet even politicians</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.450" end="01:08:43.250" style="s2">can do it the lowest of low yeah so for</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.660" end="01:08:44.779" style="s2">our audience can we have some very</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.250" end="01:08:48.020" style="s2">interesting people listening to the show</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.779" end="01:08:49.790" style="s2">a lot of that&#39;s in the world changing</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.020" end="01:08:51.230" style="s2">movement suppose someone wants to learn</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.790" end="01:08:53.120" style="s2">how to do warm data how do they get a</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.230" end="01:08:55.210" style="s2">hold of you for that purpose yeah they</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.120" end="01:08:58.970" style="s2">probably need to just send me an email</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.210" end="01:09:01.489" style="s2">go through the Bateson Institute or find</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.970" end="01:09:04.100" style="s2">me in social media cuz I&#39;m everywhere in</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.489" end="01:09:07.250" style="s2">there and I offer courses I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.100" end="01:09:10.549" style="s2">got one coming up in Ireland in February</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.250" end="01:09:14.330" style="s2">and might have one in Pittsburgh in</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.549" end="01:09:16.130" style="s2">January one in Brazil in January we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.330" end="01:09:17.720" style="s2">put a link up to wherever you tell us to</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.130" end="01:09:20.120" style="s2">put it to for people who are interested</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.720" end="01:09:21.950" style="s2">in connecting with you to get some</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.120" end="01:09:23.960" style="s2">training and how to do this more data</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.950" end="01:09:25.460" style="s2">thing because its own sounds really</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.960" end="01:09:27.859" style="s2">interesting and if you can actually get</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.460" end="01:09:30.080" style="s2">instantiated in the individuals a high</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.859" end="01:09:32.120" style="s2">dimensional but not abstracted</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.080" end="01:09:35.779" style="s2">perspective on the problem that would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.120" end="01:09:38.420" style="s2">huge it&#39;s huge Jim it&#39;s so amazing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.779" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">every time it blows my mind I can see</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.420" end="01:09:41.900" style="s2">why it&#39;s is what we kind of wanted but</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:43.549" style="s2">we haven&#39;t been able to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.900" end="01:09:44.900" style="s2">to do otherwise it&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.549" end="01:09:46.910" style="s2">that we were doing it in the humans</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.900" end="01:09:48.350" style="s2">themselves is probably we should have</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.910" end="01:09:50.569" style="s2">thought about that duh</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.350" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">you want to not abstract it birds and</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.569" end="01:09:52.520" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t do it in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:55.010" style="s2">computers you&#39;d probably do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.520" end="01:09:58.280" style="s2">human right well that&#39;s exactly how I</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.010" end="01:10:01.430" style="s2">felt was sort of like well duh but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.280" end="01:10:04.100" style="s2">mean really I had every opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.430" end="01:10:07.760" style="s2">have already known this and I I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.100" end="01:10:10.460" style="s2">still just sort of gobsmacked when I saw</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.760" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">it happen and watched the level of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.460" end="01:10:15.140" style="s2">has to do with the fact that people</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:19.370" style="s2">speak in multiple tones across multiple</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.140" end="01:10:22.010" style="s2">contexts with multiple people if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.370" end="01:10:24.489" style="s2">think of it as a moiré think of all the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.010" end="01:10:26.860" style="s2">patterns that are overlay</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.489" end="01:10:29.710" style="s2">and there&#39;s no documentation during the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.860" end="01:10:31.449" style="s2">lab because if you document then the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.710" end="01:10:34.059" style="s2">cooking stops you know that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.449" end="01:10:37.269" style="s2">be able to let those things swirl around</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.059" end="01:10:40.179" style="s2">and connect and relink and reframe and</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.269" end="01:10:41.650" style="s2">they need to keep moving until after the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.179" end="01:10:43.780" style="s2">lab and then there&#39;s a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.650" end="01:10:45.909" style="s2">moment that&#39;s in the plenary that that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.780" end="01:10:48.369" style="s2">call the samatha see moment so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.909" end="01:10:50.289" style="s2">this word for mutual learning but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.369" end="01:10:53.199" style="s2">the mutual learning moment where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.289" end="01:10:55.960" style="s2">actually at the group level the words</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.199" end="01:10:59.170" style="s2">form around what has just been</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.960" end="01:11:01.409" style="s2">experienced and not before which has</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.170" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">been a really interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.409" end="01:11:06.699" style="s2">development of watching how this works</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:09.369" style="s2">because some people at the end of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.699" end="01:11:11.469" style="s2">hour and a half they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.369" end="01:11:14.590" style="s2">words at all for what they&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.469" end="01:11:18.849" style="s2">experienced they&#39;re just sort of sitting</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.590" end="01:11:22.809" style="s2">in the soup and other people they start</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.849" end="01:11:25.380" style="s2">to find them slowly and then one person</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.809" end="01:11:28.090" style="s2">will say yeah I noticed that the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.380" end="01:11:31.119" style="s2">stories was coming up in different</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.090" end="01:11:33.699" style="s2">contexts or I noticed when I sat down</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.119" end="01:11:35.289" style="s2">that I had no idea what these people</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.699" end="01:11:37.059" style="s2">were talking about that they had</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.289" end="01:11:40.480" style="s2">approached it completely differently</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.059" end="01:11:43.179" style="s2">than I would have or you know they start</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.480" end="01:11:46.929" style="s2">to find the edges where they can begin</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.179" end="01:11:50.289" style="s2">to understand what has happened and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.929" end="01:11:53.019" style="s2">together they they work it out so the in</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.289" end="01:11:55.269" style="s2">the plenary there&#39;s this kind of mutual</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.019" end="01:11:57.219" style="s2">learning of how are we going to put</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.269" end="01:11:59.590" style="s2">language on this experience we just</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.219" end="01:12:02.530" style="s2">shared so they all had completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.590" end="01:12:04.119" style="s2">different conversations right if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.530" end="01:12:05.800" style="s2">were to get a transcript of it they</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.119" end="01:12:08.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the same conversation they</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.800" end="01:12:09.099" style="s2">were in different things what they did</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.050" end="01:12:11.320" style="s2">was that it&#39;s exactly through</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.099" end="01:12:14.730" style="s2">conversation space ever each injector e</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.320" end="01:12:17.139" style="s2">different exactly so the pings of</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.730" end="01:12:19.860" style="s2">recognition and familiarity are</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.139" end="01:12:23.530" style="s2">absolutely not the same in each person</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.860" end="01:12:25.510" style="s2">but the overall thing is the same which</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.530" end="01:12:27.070" style="s2">is the recognition of well where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.510" end="01:12:29.289" style="s2">health how are you gonna contribute to</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.070" end="01:12:32.320" style="s2">health are you gonna get a new exercise</p>

<p begin="01:12:38.140" end="01:12:43.090" style="s2">space it&#39;s in the interdependency and</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.530" end="01:12:45.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the piece where there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.090" end="01:12:48.820" style="s2">sometimes suddenly this moment group</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.090" end="01:12:51.910" style="s2">kind of gasp of hopelessness of like oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.820" end="01:12:55.240" style="s2">no we don&#39;t know what to do in that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.910" end="01:13:01.390" style="s2">space because that isn&#39;t a space that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:13:01.390" end="01:13:05.950" style="s2">have to make something up and it&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.730" end="01:13:09.490" style="s2">us you know to my mind that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.950" end="01:13:11.650" style="s2">learned helplessness of people in gay</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.490" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">maze the first thing we have to crack</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.650" end="01:13:16.150" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize frankly the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.320" end="01:13:17.860" style="s2">is like butter you can cut the world</p>

<p begin="01:13:17.860" end="01:13:22.750" style="s2">enough force against it right so many</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.990" end="01:13:24.340" style="s2">people have just become helpless and</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.750" end="01:13:26.050" style="s2">expect the world like you kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.340" end="01:13:27.970" style="s2">your conversation about the state and</p>

<p begin="01:13:27.970" end="01:13:33.550" style="s2">problems no we need to deal with our</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.770" end="01:13:36.940" style="s2">problems goddamnit yeah and and we need</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.550" end="01:13:38.950" style="s2">to do it by getting out of our roles so</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.940" end="01:13:41.470" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that pops out</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.950" end="01:13:43.270" style="s2">right away is that you know someone will</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.470" end="01:13:46.510" style="s2">be an expert in something right</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.270" end="01:13:48.280" style="s2">everyone&#39;s an expert in something and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.510" end="01:13:50.980" style="s2">they know their script when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.280" end="01:13:53.170" style="s2">sitting in that context and they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.980" end="01:13:55.000" style="s2">you know that they got it down but when</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.170" end="01:13:57.130" style="s2">they get to it the next context they</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.000" end="01:13:59.800" style="s2">don&#39;t have a script for that one so they</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.130" end="01:14:01.510" style="s2">have to source their understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.800" end="01:14:04.420" style="s2">that you know whether whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.510" end="01:14:05.830" style="s2">health in the form of economy and</p>

<p begin="01:14:05.830" end="01:14:10.720" style="s2">a doctor but they do have a body and</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.690" end="01:14:12.970" style="s2">they do have a bank account right so</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.720" end="01:14:15.490" style="s2">they have to drop in to their humanity</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.970" end="01:14:17.950" style="s2">they have to drop into this lived</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.490" end="01:14:20.680" style="s2">experience and connect it to their</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.950" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">professional banks are connected across</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.680" end="01:14:27.280" style="s2">lots of different aspects and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:30.460" style="s2">the thing of really recognizing that if</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.280" end="01:14:33.640" style="s2">we&#39;re working with complex issues we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.460" end="01:14:36.550" style="s2">got to be working with in direct</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.640" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2">response and this is a sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.550" end="01:14:44.380" style="s2">paradoxical question of how do you</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:46.450" style="s2">prepare an indirect response because the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.380" end="01:14:49.570" style="s2">second you try to solve a complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.450" end="01:14:52.079" style="s2">problem by directly going at it you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.570" end="01:14:55.170" style="s2">already missed the bus</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.079" end="01:14:57.989" style="s2">so how do you begin to generate an</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.170" end="01:15:00.329" style="s2">indirect response and that that has been</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.989" end="01:15:03.030" style="s2">so exciting to see what people come up</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.329" end="01:15:05.099" style="s2">with and the directions they take it and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.030" end="01:15:07.860" style="s2">these things that just come out like you</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.099" end="01:15:09.659" style="s2">said it generates a kind of you know it</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.860" end="01:15:15.119" style="s2">was the second-order cybernetics</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.659" end="01:15:16.889" style="s2">emergent thing is happening that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.119" end="01:15:18.750" style="s2">very cool I think again I&#39;m gonna call</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.889" end="01:15:20.130" style="s2">out to people in the game bu world and</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.750" end="01:15:22.409" style="s2">the rest of the social change world</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.130" end="01:15:23.909" style="s2">somebody gotta take the door up on it</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.409" end="01:15:26.520" style="s2">and get to get trained on her technique</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.909" end="01:15:29.300" style="s2">give it a try and see see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.520" end="01:15:31.440" style="s2">I&#39;d love to see you know careful</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.300" end="01:15:33.179" style="s2">documentation of how the process works</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:35.730" style="s2">not necessarily documentation within the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.179" end="01:15:37.409" style="s2">process but an outer documentation to</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.730" end="01:15:39.900" style="s2">really think about this thing is</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.409" end="01:15:42.059" style="s2">possibly a very powerful phenomenon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.900" end="01:15:44.670" style="s2">a very powerful phenomenon and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.059" end="01:15:46.260" style="s2">little scared to write it up ah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.670" end="01:15:48.540" style="s2">that&#39;s good that means you got something</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.260" end="01:15:50.790" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been sitting on this</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.540" end="01:15:53.460" style="s2">pressure to write this warm data book</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.790" end="01:15:55.949" style="s2">which I&#39;m half done but I keep not doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.460" end="01:16:00.150" style="s2">it and this is the reason I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.949" end="01:16:02.730" style="s2">it is because I yeah you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.150" end="01:16:04.770" style="s2">this is I don&#39;t it would be something</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.730" end="01:16:08.250" style="s2">that I think I might need to do with</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.770" end="01:16:11.520" style="s2">other people to try to keep it from</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.250" end="01:16:14.309" style="s2">getting too I don&#39;t know I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.520" end="01:16:17.219" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen what happens with a world</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.309" end="01:16:20.610" style="s2">that metabolizes all good ideas into</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.219" end="01:16:23.190" style="s2">ways of making money and getting control</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.610" end="01:16:25.440" style="s2">and the last thing I want to be a part</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.190" end="01:16:28.409" style="s2">of is finding a way for people to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.440" end="01:16:30.449" style="s2">control of complexity or emergence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.409" end="01:16:33.050" style="s2">always what comes up it&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.449" end="01:16:36.090" style="s2">we have complexity great let&#39;s manage it</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.050" end="01:16:38.909" style="s2">the worst case scenarios now becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.090" end="01:16:42.420" style="s2">power tool for ad agencies right or</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.909" end="01:16:44.940" style="s2">something I mean it it might be beyond</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.420" end="01:16:46.440" style="s2">that but it&#39;s the logical types aspect</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.250" end="01:16:51.449" style="s2">I say a little bit more about that well</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.929" end="01:16:54.270" style="s2">you know with Bertrand Russell&#39;s logical</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.449" end="01:16:56.550" style="s2">types when you&#39;re picking the topic and</p>

<p begin="01:16:56.550" end="01:17:04.559" style="s2">to understand logical typing and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.820" end="01:17:05.760" style="s2">know that&#39;s math but it&#39;s also not math</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.559" end="01:17:07.980" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.760" end="01:17:10.680" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of combination of Bertrand</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.980" end="01:17:14.010" style="s2">Russell and my dad coming together to</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.680" end="01:17:16.500" style="s2">think about what it means to not make</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.010" end="01:17:18.360" style="s2">logical typing errors and and even when</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.500" end="01:17:21.780" style="s2">you&#39;re doing abductive inquiry you have</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.360" end="01:17:23.520" style="s2">to be careful what level your contexts</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.780" end="01:17:25.890" style="s2">are on because if you get them at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:28.080" style="s2">wrong ones you can make associations</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.890" end="01:17:30.810" style="s2">that are all sorts of trouble and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.080" end="01:17:31.950" style="s2">not good so there are things that I</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.810" end="01:17:34.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know yet</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.950" end="01:17:35.430" style="s2">about this that&#39;s why you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.410" end="01:17:37.230" style="s2">written your book I&#39;ve had the same</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.350" end="01:17:48.240" style="s2">to write the essay I know but the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.450" end="01:17:50.820" style="s2">is so demanding right now of this work</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.240" end="01:17:54.720" style="s2">getting out there because this urgency</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.820" end="01:17:58.470" style="s2">and also there&#39;s just so much so much</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.720" end="01:18:03.000" style="s2">human effort and money and just an</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.470" end="01:18:04.280" style="s2">exhaustion of people&#39;s focus on all</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.000" end="01:18:07.650" style="s2">these things that are actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.280" end="01:18:09.510" style="s2">completely going nowhere and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.650" end="01:18:11.190" style="s2">frustrating to watch it and you just</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.510" end="01:18:12.750" style="s2">think oh I wish I could just give you</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.190" end="01:18:16.800" style="s2">something that you could play with but</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.750" end="01:18:18.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite cooked yet your</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.800" end="01:18:20.310" style="s2">frustrations I got a couple of things</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.330" end="01:18:22.290" style="s2">like that I&#39;ve cooked it myself not in</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.310" end="01:18:24.180" style="s2">this area but in other areas this has</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.290" end="01:18:26.490" style="s2">been an amazing conversation and this</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.180" end="01:18:28.800" style="s2">sets the new world record for the least</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.490" end="01:18:32.400" style="s2">number of my topics such attitude a</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.800" end="01:18:35.070" style="s2">conversation I usually get to about</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.400" end="01:18:37.680" style="s2">two-thirds of my topic notes I would say</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.070" end="01:18:40.440" style="s2">we got the 20% today but we explored</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.680" end="01:18:42.810" style="s2">some amazing new space when I would if</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.440" end="01:18:45.330" style="s2">you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d like to ask you one a</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.810" end="01:18:47.160" style="s2">little bit more bounded question that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.330" end="01:18:48.480" style="s2">think is closely related to all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.160" end="01:18:49.890" style="s2">things we&#39;ve just been talked about in</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.480" end="01:18:53.850" style="s2">the book you talk about leadership</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.890" end="01:18:55.970" style="s2">within the paradox of agency hmm and one</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.850" end="01:18:58.500" style="s2">of the issues problems and opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.970" end="01:19:00.330" style="s2">certainly in game be and I think in all</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.500" end="01:19:01.410" style="s2">people world changers thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.330" end="01:19:04.050" style="s2">what comes next</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.410" end="01:19:07.260" style="s2">is what does leadership mean in a world</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.050" end="01:19:09.630" style="s2">that&#39;s probably not hierarchical more</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.260" end="01:19:12.660" style="s2">network oriented you know aiming for</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.630" end="01:19:14.580" style="s2">metastability not rigid stability what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.660" end="01:19:18.270" style="s2">your vision of leadership going forward</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.580" end="01:19:19.170" style="s2">uh Jim I I you know it&#39;s a cringe word</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.270" end="01:19:21.120" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.170" end="01:19:23.640" style="s2">but it is an important thing to talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.120" end="01:19:27.239" style="s2">about and I I think that for me what</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.640" end="01:19:30.540" style="s2">what I see is that that leadership has</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.239" end="01:19:33.300" style="s2">something to do more with improvisation</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.540" end="01:19:36.510" style="s2">in the sense that you can you know jump</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.300" end="01:19:39.300" style="s2">in and jump out give what you gotta give</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.510" end="01:19:41.630" style="s2">and get back and let somebody else give</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.300" end="01:19:45.810" style="s2">what they have to give so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.630" end="01:19:48.510" style="s2">then there&#39;s also I it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.810" end="01:19:51.360" style="s2">you a form of integrity that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.510" end="01:19:53.850" style="s2">exploring right now which is a different</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.360" end="01:19:57.449" style="s2">kind of integrity it&#39;s not the integrity</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.850" end="01:19:59.820" style="s2">of you know the rules of right and wrong</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.449" end="01:20:05.040" style="s2">it&#39;s the integrity of living in a world</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.820" end="01:20:07.140" style="s2">in which we don&#39;t know we&#39;re unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.040" end="01:20:11.969" style="s2">with the complexities that we&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.140" end="01:20:14.880" style="s2">with and in that complexity being in it</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.969" end="01:20:18.300" style="s2">with humility and curiosity and rigor in</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.880" end="01:20:21.179" style="s2">a way that recognizes this delicate</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.300" end="01:20:23.550" style="s2">interdependency of life and so many of</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.179" end="01:20:27.179" style="s2">the humans that have stepped into</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.550" end="01:20:28.650" style="s2">leadership roles have abused it and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.179" end="01:20:30.870" style="s2">many of the people who have actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.650" end="01:20:33.360" style="s2">been working with systems and complexity</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.870" end="01:20:35.460" style="s2">you know they&#39;re super smart in their</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.360" end="01:20:37.949" style="s2">books and then they treat their kids</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.460" end="01:20:43.650" style="s2">like or they you know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.949" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">not an extension of that care into the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.650" end="01:20:48.770" style="s2">details of everyday life which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:52.440" style="s2">actually really a rigorous thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.770" end="01:20:55.949" style="s2">to take that intellectual knowing and</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.440" end="01:20:58.679" style="s2">theoretical knowing and lodge it firmly</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.949" end="01:20:59.460" style="s2">in the process of getting from one day</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.679" end="01:21:01.560" style="s2">to the next</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.460" end="01:21:02.880" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a key a key theme in</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.560" end="01:21:04.980" style="s2">the game be work particularly people</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.880" end="01:21:08.219" style="s2">like Jordan Hall I don&#39;t have you read a</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.980" end="01:21:10.500" style="s2">his stuff but he&#39;s very much about how</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.219" end="01:21:12.989" style="s2">do we take these grand theories from</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.500" end="01:21:15.660" style="s2">complexity in other places and turn them</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.989" end="01:21:19.500" style="s2">into a way of being that&#39;s authentic and</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.660" end="01:21:21.239" style="s2">yet rigorous yeah I&#39;m with him on this I</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.500" end="01:21:23.040" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard him say those words but if</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.239" end="01:21:26.429" style="s2">you said him I agree with him I thought</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.040" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">he said him quite that way but a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.429" end="01:21:31.800" style="s2">more words I&#39;ll tell you that I love</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:32.820" style="s2">Jordan he&#39;s he&#39;s like best friends but</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.800" end="01:21:34.050" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.820" end="01:21:36.810" style="s2">and can be a little bit verbose</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.050" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">sometimes but I&#39;ll say three words he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.810" end="01:21:41.730" style="s2">say 37 but I&#39;m sure he gets it gets</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.360" end="01:21:43.380" style="s2">nuances that I missed I&#39;m kind of us you</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.730" end="01:21:46.079" style="s2">know straightforward person of action</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.380" end="01:21:47.820" style="s2">not necessarily a you know a subtle</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.079" end="01:21:48.869" style="s2">thinker in the way he is but yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.820" end="01:21:50.849" style="s2">think we&#39;re all working towards these</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.869" end="01:21:51.900" style="s2">same things in our own way but throw</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.849" end="01:21:52.920" style="s2">something back at you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.900" end="01:21:54.630" style="s2">leadership one of the things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.920" end="01:21:57.050" style="s2">talked about in the game be world in</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.630" end="01:21:59.730" style="s2">other places is the distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.050" end="01:22:02.219" style="s2">position based leadership and role based</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.730" end="01:22:03.270" style="s2">leadership we think of position based</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.219" end="01:22:05.610" style="s2">leadership with you know your typical</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.270" end="01:22:07.110" style="s2">I&#39;m the manager or the XYZ Department</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.610" end="01:22:09.179" style="s2">because my name is in the box that my</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.110" end="01:22:10.889" style="s2">name is on the door while role based</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.179" end="01:22:12.270" style="s2">leadership does hey group people trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.889" end="01:22:14.369" style="s2">to solve a problem and for the next half</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.270" end="01:22:16.020" style="s2">hour I&#39;m gonna lead the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.369" end="01:22:17.730" style="s2">because I know more about how to fix an</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.020" end="01:22:19.860" style="s2">automatic transmission than anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.730" end="01:22:21.719" style="s2">in the group but when the topic moves on</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.860" end="01:22:23.940" style="s2">to how to fix the engine that&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.719" end="01:22:25.800" style="s2">else&#39;s job to lead that discussion yeah</p>

<p begin="01:22:25.800" end="01:22:30.750" style="s2">you step in and you step out so no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.710" end="01:22:33.570" style="s2">the leader it&#39;s just a space for</p>

<p begin="01:23:01.050" end="01:23:06.420" style="s2">we&#39;re in this together so even when</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.199" end="01:23:09.630" style="s2">you&#39;re doing a solo it has to be in</p>
