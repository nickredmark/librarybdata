<p begin="00:00:09.890" end="00:00:14.269" style="s2">conquering words there are either dirty</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.500" end="00:00:16.309" style="s2">words people tell us no you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.269" end="00:00:18.619" style="s2">that word is so misunderstood bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.309" end="00:00:20.119" style="s2">bla but I think reconquering words and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.619" end="00:00:21.320" style="s2">giving me a new meaning actually works</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.119" end="00:00:23.539" style="s2">ok great</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.320" end="00:00:25.669" style="s2">that&#39;s great and and your book is called</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.539" end="00:00:26.119" style="s2">Cynthia ISM creating God in the internet</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.669" end="00:00:28.759" style="s2">age</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.119" end="00:00:32.570" style="s2">so creating God right if God is the name</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.759" end="00:00:34.310" style="s2">of all our dreams combined in one point</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.570" end="00:00:36.980" style="s2">if the name of that is the gourd point</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.310" end="00:00:38.900" style="s2">then I&#39;d love to retake the word God and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.980" end="00:00:40.760" style="s2">put it back into its historical setting</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.900" end="00:00:43.310" style="s2">what was originally used which was was</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.760" end="00:00:46.190" style="s2">you know a head of the patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.310" end="00:00:48.200" style="s2">removing is God like father Patrick</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.190" end="00:00:50.750" style="s2">there and we have God is the other end</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.200" end="00:00:54.020" style="s2">so you put God in the future which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.750" end="00:00:57.650" style="s2">interesting I think because because God</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.020" end="00:01:00.020" style="s2">is usually considered the creator of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.650" end="00:01:03.050" style="s2">universe so in the past right</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.020" end="00:01:05.150" style="s2">you&#39;re putting that&#39;s in the future well</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.050" end="00:01:06.800" style="s2">not even then I mean even the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.150" end="00:01:09.110" style="s2">doesn&#39;t claim that the Bible clothes</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.800" end="00:01:12.230" style="s2">created order in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.110" end="00:01:14.590" style="s2">nobody but the Bible God is the source</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.230" end="00:01:17.630" style="s2">of everything</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.630" end="00:01:21.380" style="s2">anything is the source of anything that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.370" end="00:01:24.409" style="s2">would be godless that&#39;s a we come out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.380" end="00:01:26.990" style="s2">the womb because to be the source of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.409" end="00:01:28.850" style="s2">everything we talk about the source tied</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.990" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">to the god cause of his usually goddess</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.850" end="00:01:32.330" style="s2">for me this was very popular with New</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:34.460" style="s2">Age people because they&#39;re like goddess</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.740" end="00:02:39.740" style="s2">idea that&#39;s what Jesus said Jesus he</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.010" end="00:02:41.630" style="s2">says that well after I left whenever you</p>

<p begin="00:02:52.490" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">agree that we can save large parts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">Christianity we could potentially write</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">a third Testament if you write a third</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:03.350" style="s2">Testament we have to leave Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:03.860" style="s2">on the cross died on the cross that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.350" end="00:03:06.860" style="s2">the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.860" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">so father can go and die so father and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.860" end="00:03:11.210" style="s2">son are gone and then we leave it to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:13.520" style="s2">community to be the community to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.210" end="00:03:15.620" style="s2">divine okay I&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.520" end="00:03:19.820" style="s2">that because the father and son come</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.620" end="00:03:23.300" style="s2">together you know and disappear and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.820" end="00:03:25.820" style="s2">you have the holy spirit that&#39;s logical</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.300" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">idea here the point is father sound was</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.820" end="00:03:32.060" style="s2">a brilliant idea because we know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:33.650" style="s2">tribe is led by the patriarchy they pull</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.060" end="00:03:36.170" style="s2">us okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.650" end="00:03:37.670" style="s2">the pattern is the son he&#39;s a grown up</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.170" end="00:03:39.380" style="s2">man we look up to him</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.670" end="00:03:41.420" style="s2">all those boys look up to him they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.380" end="00:03:44.090" style="s2">to be like him he&#39;s the chieftain in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.420" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">priest at the same time okay he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.090" end="00:03:48.500" style="s2">benevolent tyrant if you like so okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:50.060" style="s2">built on the King Solomon character in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.500" end="00:03:50.810" style="s2">the Old Testament that&#39;s the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.810" end="00:03:57.470" style="s2">the son okay his father is the guy we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.350" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">don&#39;t see because to believe that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.470" end="00:04:02.570" style="s2">gonna follow him there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:05.239" style="s2">direction towards a goal that&#39;s called</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.930" end="00:04:13.610" style="s2">okay the name of the promise time is God</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.330" end="00:04:18.410" style="s2">that means the father figure as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.610" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">father of the father mm-hmm that&#39;s God</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.410" end="00:04:25.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the father so father is where</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.030" end="00:04:36.500" style="s2">theory or tribal anthropology based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.490" end="00:04:38.509" style="s2">modern data science based on how human</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.039" end="00:04:43.940" style="s2">the congregation has a model based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:45.620" style="s2">the tribe congregation basically is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.940" end="00:04:47.930" style="s2">one thing that unites family and try it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.620" end="00:04:49.879" style="s2">into one thing okay that congregation</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.930" end="00:04:51.530" style="s2">has to be on the moon now if we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.879" end="00:04:53.900" style="s2">this if the sort of the mysticism is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.530" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">gone if we know that we have to be on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.900" end="00:04:57.259" style="s2">the move and we know that we know Matic</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:04:58.970" style="s2">you&#39;re not moving into the future it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.259" end="00:05:00.979" style="s2">along the time axis removing these days</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.970" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">moving into the future for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.979" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">congregation to walk into the future we</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.889" style="s2">still need this and of course we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:09.590" style="s2">tell the story the way Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.889" end="00:05:11.300" style="s2">does that there&#39;s a father that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.590" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">point where we&#39;re heading the gaud point</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.300" end="00:05:16.520" style="s2">this is son who leads us to go there the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:19.190" style="s2">combinational priest in chief Tana leads</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:21.020" style="s2">us to go there and then we are issued</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.190" end="00:05:23.000" style="s2">and then of course at the back of it all</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.020" end="00:05:25.009" style="s2">we have the match art and the match art</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.000" end="00:05:28.310" style="s2">in Christianity is Virgin Mary with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.009" end="00:05:30.710" style="s2">Jesus child mm-hmm she becomes not only</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.310" end="00:05:31.669" style="s2">the child Jesus because her son is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.710" end="00:05:33.289" style="s2">son of God</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.669" end="00:05:35.210" style="s2">that means if she&#39;s the mother to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.289" end="00:05:38.389" style="s2">Son of God she&#39;s the ultimate metric</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.210" end="00:05:40.819" style="s2">meaning Virgin Mary walks at the very</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.389" end="00:05:42.949" style="s2">back pushes us all forward so then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.819" end="00:05:46.099" style="s2">get the Christian version of the pastor</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.949" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">key master key trial nothing more mmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.099" end="00:05:48.919" style="s2">okay that makes perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">the beautiful stories worked really well</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.919" end="00:05:53.479" style="s2">it could still work if people still live</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:55.849" style="s2">in it but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.479" end="00:05:57.949" style="s2">do it that way in Shaba shixin my point</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.949" end="00:06:04.159" style="s2">post atheist is essentially that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.460" end="00:06:05.990" style="s2">create the store now knowing why we did</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.159" end="00:06:08.270" style="s2">that store in the first place and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.990" end="00:06:09.770" style="s2">it happens when we go from the first to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.270" end="00:06:12.229" style="s2">the second Testament the Bible but</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.770" end="00:06:14.419" style="s2">happens in Jesus dies on the cross when</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.229" end="00:06:18.139" style="s2">he dies so the cross the curtain in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.139" end="00:06:22.159" style="s2">apart that means the two different</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.159" end="00:06:28.550" style="s2">temple are unified meaning we as people</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.550" end="00:06:34.729" style="s2">at looking into a God really is the God</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.190" end="00:06:36.589" style="s2">really a story about our direction to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.729" end="00:06:39.259" style="s2">make us survive and thrive and live</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.589" end="00:06:40.520" style="s2">whole and fool us okay so that what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.259" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">hidden becomes kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.520" end="00:06:45.050" style="s2">revealed something like that which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">problematic because we live increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.050" end="00:06:48.259" style="s2">in a digital world today where</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:49.789" style="s2">everything becomes transparent everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.259" end="00:06:51.229" style="s2">gets to know everything and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.789" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">exactly why I&#39;m telling people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.229" end="00:06:55.789" style="s2">important to create sacred spaces for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:06:57.830" style="s2">example confession booths for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.789" end="00:06:59.690" style="s2">places where you you know where I could</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.830" end="00:07:01.729" style="s2">control you work with ayahuasca you work</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:04.490" style="s2">with modern spiritual practices but you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.729" end="00:07:06.229" style="s2">tithe you build the wall around and say</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.490" end="00:07:07.970" style="s2">okay we turn off our smartphones we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.229" end="00:07:10.009" style="s2">trying to fold the data flows so he can</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.970" end="00:07:12.289" style="s2">talk freely in this space but at the end</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.009" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">of the day what&#39;s called mr. stirs which</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.289" end="00:07:17.090" style="s2">is this is knowledge that&#39;s taking you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:19.069" style="s2">years to get it is taking you years to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.090" end="00:07:20.870" style="s2">understand and it&#39;s taking years to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.069" end="00:07:23.000" style="s2">understand this must not be spread</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.870" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">widely among people because they will</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.000" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">misunderstand it mm-hmm okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:30.169" style="s2">dangerous if not it&#39;s that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:33.139" style="s2">understood gets out in the public it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.169" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">would be completely misunderstood the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.139" end="00:07:37.909" style="s2">entire history of philosophy theology is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:40.280" style="s2">basically misunderstood today because</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.909" end="00:07:41.960" style="s2">the reinterpret is being symbolic words</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.280" end="00:07:43.699" style="s2">and names are being thrown around by</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.960" end="00:07:44.690" style="s2">people who simply haven&#39;t studied they</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.699" end="00:07:46.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.690" end="00:07:48.620" style="s2">that is a big mistake but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.880" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">basically condition we live in at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.620" end="00:07:52.340" style="s2">moment so if it&#39;s if the genies out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:54.259" style="s2">the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.340" end="00:07:56.779" style="s2">all it can do is to learn to know how</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.259" end="00:07:58.819" style="s2">the genie works and tame the genie and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.779" end="00:08:00.889" style="s2">try to turn the genie to something works</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.819" end="00:08:02.690" style="s2">our advantage is units yeah so there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.889" end="00:08:05.779" style="s2">a very dangerous genie out of the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.690" end="00:08:08.270" style="s2">at the moment and that seems to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.779" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">well my what I&#39;m working towards is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.270" end="00:08:13.190" style="s2">basically to understand and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">giving way what the Enlightenment did</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.190" end="00:08:17.330" style="s2">and started with the Frankfurt School in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:18.409" style="s2">the 1930s we started learning that being</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.330" end="00:08:20.810" style="s2">enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.409" end="00:08:23.990" style="s2">living in a world it becomes coldly</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.810" end="00:08:26.599" style="s2">scientific killing a lot of spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.990" end="00:08:28.509" style="s2">and killing even the human soul in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.599" end="00:08:31.340" style="s2">process which we have to reinstate now</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.509" end="00:08:33.140" style="s2">caused a lot of damage that&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.340" end="00:08:34.070" style="s2">sample of you know all the Lourdes was</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.140" end="00:08:35.870" style="s2">out there okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.070" end="00:08:38.919" style="s2">but if all the knowledge was out there</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.870" end="00:08:41.419" style="s2">and the priests are now undressed and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.919" end="00:08:43.399" style="s2">religion no longer has the sacred space</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.419" end="00:08:45.829" style="s2">and that sacred space it should have</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.399" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">existed has been completely corrupted by</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.829" end="00:08:49.670" style="s2">the way my beautiful priests all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">of things okay we better let the air in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.670" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">better let it all out better get the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:55.240" style="s2">genie completely out of the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:57.510" style="s2">better even cross the bottom throw it</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:09:01.330" style="s2">away so we then can deal with the genies</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.510" end="00:09:04.210" style="s2">okay that&#39;s right but I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.330" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">define new sacred spaces and I think any</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.210" end="00:09:08.529" style="s2">private confession booth any any</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.550" end="00:09:12.760" style="s2">environment that requires a code of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.529" end="00:09:14.529" style="s2">silence it should be celebrated and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.760" end="00:09:16.899" style="s2">that we have to do that all over again</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.529" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">but the knowledge that is out already</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.899" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">available to people have now to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:23.740" style="s2">explained means if it&#39;s out there you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.480" style="s2">can read them take a patio you can read</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.740" end="00:09:27.730" style="s2">online but you don&#39;t understand okay you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.480" end="00:09:30.190" style="s2">need teachers to guide you through that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.730" end="00:09:32.500" style="s2">all a huge flow information all the data</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.190" end="00:09:34.209" style="s2">to guide you to understand it and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.500" end="00:09:36.820" style="s2">have to work very quickly in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.209" end="00:09:38.920" style="s2">and go deeper mm-hmm okay well the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.820" end="00:09:41.800" style="s2">example I was thinking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.920" end="00:09:44.020" style="s2">the genie being out of the bottle as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.800" end="00:09:46.810" style="s2">know years ago I started doing these</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.020" end="00:09:49.480" style="s2">Buddhist practice and and Vajrayana</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.810" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">tradition and I had to do all of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.480" end="00:09:56.950" style="s2">sort of stage-by-stage</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:59.290" style="s2">retreats and gradually grind it was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.950" end="00:10:03.190" style="s2">gradual sort of learning process right</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.290" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">and and then you would then you would</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.190" end="00:10:07.450" style="s2">get the initiation uh-huh and you would</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.430" style="s2">go on to do other stuff and there be</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.450" end="00:10:16.570" style="s2">another initiation and would go on and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.430" end="00:10:18.270" style="s2">on until the end theoretically and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.570" end="00:10:21.520" style="s2">stuff that they would be trend</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.270" end="00:10:25.270" style="s2">transmitting is now available everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.520" end="00:10:26.020" style="s2">on the Internet yeah so so that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.270" end="00:10:28.180" style="s2">an example</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.020" end="00:10:30.010" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s causing a lot of havoc</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.180" end="00:10:31.420" style="s2">we have to get used to have to get used</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.010" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re living increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.420" end="00:10:37.240" style="s2">in a transparent world where everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:39.670" style="s2">is being memorized no so I I&#39;m not naive</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.240" end="00:10:41.170" style="s2">about that in that way I can see the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.670" end="00:10:44.110" style="s2">Enlightenment project coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.170" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">West hitting the world over the last 100</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.110" end="00:10:47.709" style="s2">years was a good thing in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:51.029" style="s2">okay it&#39;s all out there it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.709" end="00:10:53.740" style="s2">basically is while they misunderstood um</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.029" end="00:10:57.190" style="s2">tragic limit understood mm-hmm meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.740" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">we have to re understand the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.190" end="00:11:02.770" style="s2">axioms we have to re understand religion</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:04.180" style="s2">where after we take the word God we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.770" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">to give it a new meaning that makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.180" end="00:11:07.660" style="s2">sense to us now oh and I&#39;m not post</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:09.370" style="s2">atheist</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.660" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">in the sense that we can use the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.370" end="00:11:14.680" style="s2">God symbolically or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:15.970" style="s2">I&#39;m not ironic at all about anything I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.680" end="00:11:17.500" style="s2">do not ronique</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.970" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">I&#39;m not a nun running Christian like</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.500" end="00:11:21.430" style="s2">Jordan Peters and I refuse to go ironic</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:25.660" style="s2">about what I got against tyranny in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.430" end="00:11:29.170" style="s2">sense no I am a big proponent of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.660" end="00:11:30.550" style="s2">potential of tribal anthropology towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.170" end="00:11:35.350" style="s2">understanding what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.550" end="00:11:39.580" style="s2">and and to reinstate that today to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.350" end="00:11:40.810" style="s2">regain a confidence in the tribe because</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.580" end="00:11:42.340" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have a confidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.810" end="00:11:43.930" style="s2">tribe it cannot have a confidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.340" end="00:11:45.640" style="s2">nation and if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.930" end="00:11:47.530" style="s2">confidence in the nation we cannot have</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.640" end="00:11:49.420" style="s2">a confidence in the Empire that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.530" end="00:11:52.360" style="s2">Internet is going to force us to live up</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.420" end="00:11:55.390" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s a good maybe segue into</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.360" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">talking about another taboo word we want</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.390" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">to injure this year and that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">communism the most taboo word perhaps in</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:07.510" style="s2">the West and and the second most about</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:14.980" style="s2">being capitalism which is interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.510" end="00:12:18.610" style="s2">there you go so so you&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.980" end="00:12:21.910" style="s2">critical about individualism and I guess</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.429" end="00:28:38.929" style="s2">problem is that Marx was completely</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.789" end="00:29:17.990" style="s2">it&#39;s called Leninism hmm and even Lennie</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.100" end="00:29:20.059" style="s2">knew that even worse would come he</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.990" end="00:29:22.340" style="s2">warned about Stalin and by the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.059" end="00:29:25.070" style="s2">Stalin takes over then you get the</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.440" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">can probably create a sustainable system</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.089" end="00:37:25.660" style="s2">we even can avoid the next ice age so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:27.640" style="s2">can keep ten billion people on the</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.859" end="00:37:59.519" style="s2">you see how you see that those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.720" end="00:38:02.489" style="s2">might make some people a bit hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.519" end="00:38:04.859" style="s2">yes yeah which is why I&#39;m saying you</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.489" end="00:38:07.340" style="s2">need to go back and revisit 1945 a</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.550" end="00:38:39.080" style="s2">so controversial is that we never dump</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.440" end="00:38:42.220" style="s2">1945 properly because we turned out of</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.010" end="00:38:56.990" style="s2">it&#39;s very concrete but by turning out of</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.990" end="00:39:02.270" style="s2">but Intel to medieval we allowed</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.270" end="00:39:06.490" style="s2">and suddenly you were allowed on stage</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.010" end="00:39:10.120" style="s2">right meaning we created enormous</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.859" end="00:40:31.789" style="s2">nuclear family that&#39;s even more American</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.869" end="00:40:33.650" style="s2">but that&#39;s how far you go anything else</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.789" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">you shoot them with the gun right okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.650" end="00:40:36.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very narrow-minded</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:38.599" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.650" end="00:40:40.099" style="s2">no wonder America has done more to</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.099" end="00:40:44.660" style="s2">anybody else ever did okay so a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.289" end="00:40:47.690" style="s2">sustainable model is prioritizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.660" end="00:40:49.819" style="s2">constructive mindset and I go to ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.690" end="00:40:52.069" style="s2">Persian philosophy or dudes or Astron</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.819" end="00:40:53.559" style="s2">ISM because it&#39;s restin ism the ethics</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.069" end="00:40:56.059" style="s2">is very simple straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.559" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">absolutely brilliant your two concepts</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.059" end="00:41:02.359" style="s2">are shot and Rui Rui is to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:04.460" style="s2">short-sighted destructive mentality</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.359" end="00:41:07.130" style="s2">meaning I&#39;ll grab whatever I can grab it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.460" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">or grab it now hmm okay then you kill</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.130" end="00:41:11.809" style="s2">yourself or somebody kills you very soon</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:13.849" style="s2">nothing&#39;s going to work you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.809" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">to have a civilization that way but that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.849" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">essentially what American individual is</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:21.980" style="s2">right the alternative to do is also we</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">just died okay I extend myself as far as</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:26.420" style="s2">I possibly can to look at the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:28.579" style="s2">effects meaning we&#39;re not dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.420" end="00:41:30.140" style="s2">climate change really primates always</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.579" end="00:41:32.690" style="s2">changed with dealing with avoiding the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.140" end="00:41:34.730" style="s2">next ice age 20,000 years ago okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.690" end="00:41:36.769" style="s2">need to create climate controlling</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.730" end="00:41:39.410" style="s2">technologies otherwise we&#39;re smoked</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.769" end="00:41:42.380" style="s2">anyway so we might as well do that so</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.410" end="00:41:45.529" style="s2">that is awesome an arse is a lady to</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.380" end="00:41:47.809" style="s2">Tantra because Tantra is like a life</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.109" end="00:42:04.789" style="s2">much better in the end that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.329" end="00:42:06.650" style="s2">investment theory invest in the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.789" end="00:42:08.660" style="s2">invest in your children investing of</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.660" end="00:42:13.130" style="s2">personal philosophy and it&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">way of looking at the world so instead</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.130" end="00:42:16.339" style="s2">of good and evil we should look at our</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:18.170" style="s2">sons really and if you discuss out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.339" end="00:42:20.059" style="s2">Hitler well he talked about the</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:55.290" style="s2">we need to leave things as they are now</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.290" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">and move all of society using technology</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.230" end="00:44:32.760" style="s2">because Stalin and Mao you know may be</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.540" end="00:44:35.400" style="s2">dirty time to retake the word</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.490" end="00:44:49.519" style="s2">essentially what the Internet&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.990" end="00:44:53.690" style="s2">us to do is trying us to turn us into</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.519" end="00:44:56.059" style="s2">communists and instead of as you notice</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.690" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">an internet that has to help it has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.059" end="00:45:01.160" style="s2">be Newton if it has some hierarchy so</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:04.970" style="s2">the hierarchies are ready now maturing</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.160" end="00:45:06.829" style="s2">they&#39;re called nodes ok nodes are</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.970" end="00:45:12.650" style="s2">hierarchy according to you nodes are</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.829" end="00:45:14.839" style="s2">hierarchies within a communist like my</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.650" end="00:45:17.390" style="s2">question is like how does hierarchy fit</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.839" end="00:45:19.099" style="s2">within communism because you know we</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.390" end="00:45:21.769" style="s2">would we would think the Communist</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.099" end="00:45:25.970" style="s2">vision would be a non hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.769" end="00:45:29.480" style="s2">vision right no no I know you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:35.750" style="s2">say no but think of communism is is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.480" end="00:45:36.769" style="s2">we flatten out inequality and Karl Marx</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.750" end="00:45:38.299" style="s2">says there&#39;s nothing wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.769" end="00:45:40.700" style="s2">capitalist let&#39;s just beat him at his</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.299" end="00:45:42.049" style="s2">own game and he says the proletariat has</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.700" end="00:45:44.150" style="s2">been better in the capitalist creating</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.049" end="00:45:46.099" style="s2">value if the proletarian through his</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.150" end="00:45:47.990" style="s2">community does not create a higher value</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.089" end="00:45:57.650" style="s2">there has to be higher value because</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.099" end="00:45:59.720" style="s2">we&#39;re tribal and we&#39;re now technologies</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:02.509" style="s2">to make us even more tractable and can</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.720" end="00:46:04.759" style="s2">extract value out of tribalism meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.509" end="00:46:05.869" style="s2">you can communities of teams who do</p>
