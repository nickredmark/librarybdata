<p begin="00:00:15.760" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">I think i&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.780" end="00:00:23.200" style="s2">what I&#39;ve learned.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.440" end="00:00:26.360" style="s2">Over the last year, um,</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.560" end="00:00:31.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve traveled to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:34.680" style="s2">about a hundred and sixty cities</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.820" end="00:00:37.000" style="s2">since last January</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.000" end="00:00:38.540" style="s2">with my wife Tammy,</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.540" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">and spoken to about 300 thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:46.000" style="s2">at live events.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.000" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">And so the first thing I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:49.000" style="s2">was that,</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:53.000" style="s2">for some reason,  I can travel to a hundred and sixty cities</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.000" end="00:00:55.540" style="s2">and speak to three hundred thousand  people</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.540" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">and that was a shock in itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">--that it&#39;s a continual shock--</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">that everywhere we go,</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">hunger</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">for whatever it is that I happened to be talking about.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:16.000" style="s2">Then,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.000" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">you know,  I think about that constantly,</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">what I am discussing with my audience,  is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:26.360" style="s2">what it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">driving this.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">I do that a variety of ways,</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">You know, one of the things I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">is listen for silence.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.200" end="00:01:40.900" style="s2">If you have thirty five hundred people in an auditorium</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.140" end="00:01:43.720" style="s2">and they all fall dead silent,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.960" style="s2">what that means is that you&#39;ve  touched on something, of,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:52.980" style="s2">that&#39;s of universal importance, in that moment anyways,</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.180" end="00:01:59.660" style="s2">Because it supersedes, the topic supersedes, anything else that&#39;s being considered, right,</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">it supersedes the desire to shift your position in your chair,</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.460" end="00:02:07.640" style="s2">it supersedes the desire to whisper to your neighbor,</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.860" end="00:02:10.300" style="s2">it grips your attention completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.520" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">and forces a silence.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">And it&#39;s a very interesting thing to, to,</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:18.800" style="s2">to listen for that,</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:23.000" style="s2">because, you see that people are in the grip of something;</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">and then, you have to puzzle out</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:28.900" style="s2">what it is that they are in the grip of.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.720" end="00:02:33.640" style="s2">I can tell you some about that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.660" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">Um, you know there is this idea that became popular in the nineteen sixties --</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">I just talked to Bishop , a bishop, Bishop Barron, about a week and a half ago for my Youtube video channel and for my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.180" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">and uh,  I told him that I was a strange psychologist because I&#39;d never told my audiences that --</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:05.000" style="s2">now I speak to individuals in the audience --. I never tell someone that they are okay the way they are,</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.000" end="00:03:09.520" style="s2">you know, there&#39;s this idea that came up in the sixties that &quot;you&#39;re okay the way you are&quot; --</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.000" end="00:03:18.100" style="s2">and, and uh, while I liked that idea very much, and I think it&#39;s a very bad idea,</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">especially when you are talking to young people who are lost and nihilistic and depressed and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">and aimless</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">and ideologically possessed and prematurely cynical,</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:35.600" style="s2">because they are NOT okay the way they are, and if you tell them that they are,</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.600" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">then they think, &quot;Well this is it - that&#39;s it, that&#39;s life - it&#39;s like, I&#39;ve hit the pinnacle at 18.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:44.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t know anything about the world. I haven&#39;t contributed anything to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:49.900" style="s2">But there is no up because I am okay the way I am.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.260" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">It&#39;s like, you are not okay the way you are. Especially if you are 18, you&#39;ve got 60 years to put yourself together,</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:03.000" style="s2">and you better be better at the end of that than you were at the beginning or something has gone seriously wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:08.520" style="s2">It&#39;s not an optimistic thing to tell people that they are okay the way they are,</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.520" end="00:04:09.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a pessimistic thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.700" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">Because what you do is denigrate what they could be for what they are.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.780" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">And, and I know that is a terrible idea technically, speaking from  a psychological perspective, because</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">it&#39;s who you COULD be that imbues your life with meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.200" end="00:04:34.200" style="s2">It&#39;s not the only thing--I mean, you have your friends and your family--but they expect something from you too.  You know they expect the best from you,</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">They expect a certain amount of improvement, especially, if you have children.  But even if you are a child, you might expect some improvement from your parents as well, um....</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.280" end="00:04:50.120" style="s2">But that&#39;s what you hope for - you hope that the person can manifest what&#39;s best in them</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.300" end="00:05:03.340" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t do that, then you are disappointed in them, just like you&#39;d be inexorably or are inexorably disappointed in yourself if you don&#39;t manifest what&#39;s best in you... and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.340" end="00:05:07.900" style="s2">and I think  that&#39;s very interesting moral law, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.200" end="00:05:17.200" style="s2">I talk a lot to my audiences about what I believe to be an incontrovertible fact,</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.200" end="00:05:35.220" style="s2">and I think that the fundamental incontrovertible fact is that life is suffering. <br /> And I think that that&#39;s why that&#39;s a primary axiom of religious belief</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.940" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">in some sense, almost, regardless of the faith, that life is suffering, and everyone knows that, although they don&#39;t necessarily like to admit it or to talk about it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.740" end="00:05:55.220" style="s2">I mean, you don&#39;t have to scrape beneath the surface very far in someone&#39;s life to find a tragedy lurking;</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.880" end="00:06:03.300" style="s2">if the person that you are speaking with doesn&#39;t have something pretty awful happening to them</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:08.340" style="s2">right at the moment economically or socially or within their family or physically or mentally,</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.580" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">the probability that someone they love has a problem of that sort is extraordinarily high</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:18.740" style="s2">and if you happen to be among the fortunate minority for whom that isn&#39;t true,</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.900" end="00:06:23.300" style="s2">well, all you have to do is wait and it will be true (laughter)</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">soon enough, and sooner than you think and worse than  you imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:44.040" style="s2">And so, and everyone knows that,  and so it&#39;s easy to understand why people become cynical and bitter and hurt and nihilistic.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.100" end="00:06:56.500" style="s2">You know, I think there&#39;s a progression in life. You know if you are naive, you think that life will be easy and that people are basically good</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">and then you have some experiences, if you are not sheltered too much, and that gets taken away from you</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.000" end="00:07:10.100" style="s2">because you betray yourself or other people betray you or you encounter a tragedy and then your naivete is shattered</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.100" end="00:07:15.220" style="s2">and the most likely place that you&#39;ll go from there isn&#39;t just something approximating cynicism,</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.220" end="00:07:25.540" style="s2">because you don&#39;t  know the alternative and your initial faith -- which was not faith but naivete --  is shattered by the terrible reality of what you encounter.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:31.920" style="s2">And then, as a cynical person, you are more wise than you are as a naive person;</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.920" end="00:07:37.100" style="s2">and then that&#39;s a strange thing because you&#39;re worse in some sense than you were,</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.400" end="00:07:44.040" style="s2">you know.   You are not as optimistic and you are not as filled with hope  and your life is more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.040" end="00:07:50.380" style="s2">and you&#39;re probably harder on other people and with more of a tendency towards cruelty and none of that seems positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:51.220" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a wisdom in cynicism that the naive lack.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:11.400" style="s2">But the problem is,  there,  that cynicism is not a useful antidote to, let&#39; say, tragedy and malevolence because there are places that you go past cynicism as you approach wisdom.</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.940" end="00:08:24.900" style="s2">And it&#39;s wisdom that you need in order to fabricate yourself this sort of vessel that will keep you afloat during stormy times.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.500" end="00:08:40.300" style="s2">And so,  I talk to you, my audiences, about wisdom, and I think I tell them other things that I believe to be true --</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.300" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">--it&#39;s like,  well --</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">life is difficult and it&#39;s tainted by malevolence and it&#39;s cast in tragedy and you need something to off-set that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:08:57.400" style="s2">because it otherwise it embitters you,</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.720" end="00:09:02.040" style="s2">and if you are embittered then you become vengeful and cruel</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.180" end="00:09:02.980" style="s2">inevitably.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.920" end="00:09:09.160" style="s2">And then you make everything that&#39;s made you worse, worse in turn,</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.100" end="00:09:14.520" style="s2">and there is no bottom to that, you know,  as any one whose even a moderate</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.600" end="00:09:22.460" style="s2">student of history soon comes to understand.  Well, there&#39;s an idea that hell is a bottomless pit,</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.500" end="00:09:31.560" style="s2">and the reason for that is that there is no situation that&#39;s so terrible that there isn&#39;t some damn fool thing that some idiot can do that will make it far worse</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:40.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s reasonably probable that you&#39;re that idiot. (laughter)</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:49.500" style="s2">And so, the question is:  What might constitute an alternative to that, and if there is an alternative [even]?</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:55.280" style="s2">You know, I learned a while back, a long while back,  reading religious mythology mostly,</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:03.080" style="s2">that,  there is a difference between thinking and paying attention and of the two, paying attention is much more important.</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.080" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">It&#39;s not the same thing as thinking, like,  when you pay attention, you&#39;re looking for what you don&#39;t know -</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:15.100" style="s2">like you kind of detach yourself and you watch and you listen and you see if things are the way you think they are,</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">and you hope they are because life is easier if things are the way you think they are;</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.340" end="00:10:31.140" style="s2">but if you find out that they&#39;re not and you&#39;re paying attention, then you can weave and you can bob and you can adapt and you can learn and so you have to learn to pay attention.</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.500" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">And I just ask people, when I&#39;m speaking, to pay attention  to what they already know.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:45.780" style="s2">Now, here&#39;s something that everybody knows ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">You know, in a world that consists of suffering and malevolence, who is it that you admire or who is it that you don&#39;t admire?</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.320" end="00:11:02.740" style="s2">Those are the same question. If you know who you don&#39;t admire, well then you have a negative model and you can go for the opposite,</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.020" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">and if you know who you admire, well then you can copy that and the instinct for admiration is an instinct for imitation and we&#39;re very imitative creatures, and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:19.720" style="s2">our instinct for admiration is the instinct for imitation.</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.940" end="00:11:27.880" style="s2">And what would you call it - &quot;A deeply biologically and  metaphysically rooted guideline to the proper path of life.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.660" end="00:11:31.540" style="s2">A question is: &quot;Is there a proper path of life?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.100" end="00:11:40.200" style="s2">Well, there are certainly pathways that make things worse,  that&#39;s something to know.  You could avoid those.</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:49.140" style="s2">And if there&#39;s something, if there are pathways that make things worse then there are the opposite pathways,  even though those might not be so clear---</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.640" end="00:11:56.780" style="s2">I think that&#39;s why we are often so enamored of evil characters in fictional representations--is because it&#39;s clearer.</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.060" end="00:12:00.780" style="s2">it&#39;s easier in some sense to make what constitutes the dark path clearer--</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:07.720" style="s2">it&#39;s easier for people to understand-- whereas the path that&#39;s positive is murkier and more difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.220" end="00:12:12.900" style="s2">But, at the very least, you know it&#39;s the opposite of that.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">So, well, who do you admire,  or we could start by, who don&#39;t you admire?</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.340" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">Well, you don&#39;t admire an adult who won&#39;t take responsibility for himself or herself and COULD.</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.340" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">You know, I understand there are people who are so broken and hurt that they need help constantly</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:35.060" style="s2">because they can&#39;t take responsibility for themselves,</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">or they can in small ways, but not completely.</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:44.540" style="s2">But you don&#39;t admire someone who won&#39;t take responsibility for themselves, in fact, you have a sense of contempt for that.</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.540" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">And if you happen to be that person then you wake up in the middle of the night and berate yourself with what&#39;s left of your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">for failing to undertake your moral duty --</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.040" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">--your intrinsic moral duty --</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.300" end="00:13:03.100" style="s2">and you can&#39;t escape that --- and that&#39;s so interesting.  Know that you can&#39;t escape that.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.300" end="00:13:10.100" style="s2">If you were the creature who could invent your own values, as Nietzsche suggested, as an antidote to the death of God, then</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.100" end="00:13:15.580" style="s2">you just forgive your transgressions and you wouldn&#39;t suffer the bitter pangs of conscience;</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">but you do, and the reason you do is because you are doing things that are wrong,  and you should stop, and you know it, maybe you can&#39;t...</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.260" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">And then, well let&#39;s say then, that the opposite is that you admire someone who can take responsibility for himself or herself, that&#39;s a start.</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.780" end="00:13:43.180" style="s2">And then maybe you admire someone even more if they&#39;ve forged their characters sufficiently to move past cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.540" end="00:13:51.200" style="s2">so that not only they take responsibility for themselves but they can take responsibility for their family.  You know, and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.620" end="00:13:58.400" style="s2">they are there for the people who love them when it&#39;s necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.760" end="00:14:09.080" style="s2">And if you do that, then you have something - I wouldn&#39;t say necessarily to be proud of,  but at least you have one less thing to upbraid yourself with.</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:12.080" style="s2">And that&#39;s something.</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.500" end="00:14:24.200" style="s2">And then you can move past that and you can say, well maybe, if you put yourself together enough -- carefully enough, spoke the truth enough,</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.620" end="00:14:29.500" style="s2">were courageous enough -- in spite of the reasons you have not to be --</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.960" end="00:14:35.800" style="s2">that you could also be someone of benefit to yourself and your family and your community.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.880" end="00:14:40.200" style="s2">And you partake in structuring things in a harmonious manner</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.300" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">by living in that way.</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:49.900" style="s2">It&#39;s not an individual focused ethos,</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.440" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s an ethos of harmony among levels.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.200" end="00:15:02.180" style="s2">You should do what&#39;s good for you but it has to be what&#39;s good for your family at the same time and it has to be what&#39;s good for you and your family and your community at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.500" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">and that works musically, you know --</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:06.920" style="s2">it makes all the levels work in harmony.</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.000" end="00:15:13.960" style="s2">And you can tell when that&#39;s happening and this is another thing that&#39;s of great utility to know is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.960" end="00:15:20.660" style="s2">when you are in that place where you are acting in the proper manner and you are facing things courageously</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.940" end="00:15:29.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re speaking the truth, you are imbued with a sense of fundamental meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.940" end="00:15:33.860" style="s2">and that meaning is the antidote to the catastrophe of life.</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.860" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">And it&#39;s the antidote psychologically, because you have to have that meaning, because otherwise your life is too dark and too dreadful and will corrupt you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.500" end="00:15:50.340" style="s2">So it&#39;s the antidote psychologically but it&#39;s also the antidote practically</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.580" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">because we are not nothing, us human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.100" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">You know, they say that we are made in the image of God --- and it&#39;s hard to say what that means-- but</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:08.020" style="s2">it means at least,  in part,  to participate in the process of bringing the good into being</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:19.820" style="s2">and we can all do that and the opposite; and if we accept our responsibility to ourselves and to other people and to our communities</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.220" end="00:16:21.900" style="s2">and we lift that load up,</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.200" end="00:16:28.440" style="s2">then we live lives that are meaningful and that stops us from being corrupt; it</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.500" end="00:16:31.660" style="s2">it provides us with a medication against catastrophe,</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.980" end="00:16:36.960" style="s2">and it also practically improves the world.</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.320" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">That&#39;s the other thing. It&#39;s not just psychological,</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.260" end="00:16:44.300" style="s2">you can make things worse, everyone knows that,</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">and no doubt you have,, in many ways; but you can make things better and they actually get better</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:53.240" style="s2">and there is a reason for hope.</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.500" end="00:17:05.320" style="s2">And there&#39;s something to be said to know that you are the sort of creature that can look mortality and catastrophe and malevolence straight in the eye,  so to speak,</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:19.420" style="s2">and nonetheless, stand up and do what&#39;s right and that all there is, in that, is good.  And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been telling people.</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.140" end="00:17:25.680" style="s2">Thank you very much.</p>
