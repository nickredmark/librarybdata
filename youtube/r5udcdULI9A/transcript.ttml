<p begin="00:00:13.650" end="00:00:18.470" style="s2">previously intractable problems now one</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.740" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">definition of open innovation is</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.470" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2">relative to a firm or a company which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">that traditionally innovation has</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">happened within the boundaries of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">company it&#39;s called closed or internal</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">innovation and open innovation is where</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">new ideas are being developed or new</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">services and technologies are being</p>
