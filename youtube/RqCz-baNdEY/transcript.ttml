<p begin="00:00:28.640" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">new way of thinking about us as one</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">in life&#39;s evolutionary journey life as a</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">foundational to what is now emerging as</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">a response to</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.160" end="00:01:03.520" style="s2">like we currently are steering our way</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">towards towards climate cataclysm</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.520" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">and um more disharmony in our species</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">right at that point where we need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.520" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">come together as one species</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">understand that we need to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">our mother this planet</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">and otherwise we might not have a future</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">our mother will go on without us so so</p>

<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">what got you into studying biology</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">and what triggered you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">to some extent leave the path of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">conventional scientist within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">academic institutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:54.799" style="s2">and and find your own path that also</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">took you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:59.119" style="s2">to the relationship between biology and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">design you pioneered a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">that other people are famous for</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">the hudson river valley</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">in new york state in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">which the indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">call part of north america turtle island</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">in fact north and south america are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">turtle islands</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">and um anyway i was allowed to run free</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">in nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">as a small child and only coming back</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">you know at the end of the day for</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">supper kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">and so i i was uh total friends with all</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">the little creatures</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">of the forest and and on the river banks</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">say i have the mud of the hudson river</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">still between my toes</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">and this got me very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">nature as a whole and my mother really</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">promoted that love of nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">and gardening she did a lot of gardening</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">and growing vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">and it was also a time still in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">great depression</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">when everyone in my culture was feeding</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">on organic food that they grew on their</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">own farms</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">and so everything about my life was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">very closely tied to nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">and so uh i wanted to as i as i grew</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">up to i guess in seventh grade i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">thrilled to have a biology course and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">realized that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">that studying biology would would help</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">me really understand who are we humans</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">where did we come from when we are going</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">where are we headed not knowing those</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">were the great philosophical questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">of the ages</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">uh i was asking them already as a child</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">and in seventh grade i was i was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">young i was only about 10 or 11 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">old i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">as i skipped a few grades in school and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">uh so i i had a wonderful biology</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">teacher and then my parents said but</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">science is for boys not for girls and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">you have our talent so they made me go</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">to an art school first</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">but eventually i got myself into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">study of science</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">and learned the traditional darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">evolution biology and then that became</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">too tight a suit for me i went all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">way through to a phd</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">and then did a postdoctoral fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">at the museum of natural history in new</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">york</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">uh studying brain evolution and uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">and and i just began to feel that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">whole darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">suit was too tight for me somehow it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">couldn&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">my experience of nature myself was so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">far different</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">from that competitive dog-eat-dog world</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">that i was taught in darwinian biology</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">and i actually left science i gave it up</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">and i i went into esoteric studies i</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">studied gergief and mata blavatsky and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">findhorn and everything i could lay my</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">hands on</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">for a broader world view something</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">expansion</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">uh expanding my worldview and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">i went off to the greek islands to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">deciding i was going to write</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">novels to explain the human condition to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">and then one day in the in the woods on</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">my little island</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">a walking stick fell on my arm a stick</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">insect with</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">long legs looking like a little walking</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">twig</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">and i burst into tears because i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">seen one since i was a child and i said</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">i still want to explain nature i still</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">want to be an evolution biologist</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">and so i kind of started over and i i</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">had taken with me</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">some of the newest books by friendship</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">copra and marilyn ferguson</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">and uh uh who held eric younch</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">the living universe the self-organizing</p>

<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">and i just devoured those books and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">had no access to libraries</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">but by writing to scientists i got</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">answers by mail and they sent me more</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">books and articles</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">i eventually met jim lovelock and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">lynn margulis</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">as i was taken from my greek island up</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">to cornwall england for a series of gaia</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">conferences</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">and so it went that&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">so you were you were part of those um</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">gaia conferences that i think um</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">goldsmith funded um and that david abram</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">was there</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">and and stephan harding and you have one</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">series of symposium i read some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">proceedings</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">it really resonates strongly with me for</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">me it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">less so the the darwinian trigger</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">although that was definitely there for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">me too</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">um or the misunderstood darwinism that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">that was taught in biology when when i</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">at university studying biology but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">extreme focus on only what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">quantifiable</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">and measurable in the convertible into</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">mathematics and statistics</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">that drove me crazy when i was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">biologist i was studying marine</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">um mammals um whales and dolphins and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">and elephant seals</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">um off the coast of california and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">much of the magic just couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">expressed in</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">p values of statistical significance and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">and that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">took me briefly away from science and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">then i also did</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">you turn back so you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">pretty much developed a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">expansion or a an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">view to how evolution functions on on</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">um looking at both the the western and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">the eastern signs you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">there seem to be clear phases in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">evolution i would i would love</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">for you to to explain that a little more</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">in detail</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">yes well i i was back in the 70s before</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">i went to greece i was very interested</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">in paraphysics and new cosmologies</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">uh things of that kind through looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">at the esoteric world i got into that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">what was called paraphysics</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:25.840" style="s2">and and realizing that in the western</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.840" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">we start with the big bang and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">a purely material</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">universe only matter and energy because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">those are measurable as you said</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">are included in reality and and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">uh big enterprise this big bang was</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">was like a battery that was fueling</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">everything including life but running</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">so the entropy the running downness of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">of the universe would eventually wipe</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">even the life that had to struggle up</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">this eroding entropic tide</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">and then i i found uh people like teddy</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">goldsmith writing a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">article showing that the earth showed no</p>

<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">except perhaps what humans were doing to</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">but on its own nature did what didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">show over four billion years of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">no sign of entropy and looking into the</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">garden just briefly come in on that one</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s something that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">thinking of a lot to to reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">um what we observe on planet earth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">the the clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">syntropic or negan trophic um role that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">plays on planet earth with the second</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">um because i also think that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">probably have a point there it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not i wouldn&#39;t say that the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">law of thermodynamics doesn&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">but what i&#39;ve realized is that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s one simple mistake that explains</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">those seem to be at loggerheads which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">time scales of physics are just so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">more vast</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">than the time scales of evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">on one it&#39;s more fundamental than that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">uh you see the the four basic principles</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">or the pillars of the of the western</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">physics worldview</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">what is it um the strong and weak</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">nuclear forces</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">and radiation uh and is it radiation</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">gravity strong and weak nuclear forces</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">okay three of those four</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">uh are really about gravity</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">and gravity is the least understood of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">those forces</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">you see the whole entropic universe is</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">based on looking through telescopes</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">through light telescopes where you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">an expanding universe</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.760" style="s2">you cannot see the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">shrinking of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.760" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">but there were early people in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">like ben benthoff&#39;s book stalking the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">wild pendulum have you ever seen that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">he was the first one to show a doughnut</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">of the universe and of course before</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">einstein the british had had</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">actually sat in their leather armchairs</p>

<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">and talking about the smoke ring</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">universe because the toroidal form the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">donut form</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">was the only shape that could hold its</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">right and it revolved this way around</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">kept turning itself inside out and bent</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">off had a cartoon where you stand on the</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">into the hole and you say oh my universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">started it that&#39;s this tiny thing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s been expanding ever since</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">because you don&#39;t notice that on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">other side of the donut it&#39;s contracting</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">with gravity in order to radiate outward</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">again right so the taoists have the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">beautiful fundamental symbol of the two</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">forces spiraling around each other</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.680" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">i think it&#39;s because they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">understand gravity and i have pondered a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">about why they have such trouble they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">talking about that that gravity may come</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">parallel universes or something if they</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">just bring it into our own universe</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">right then you have the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">in balance and showing that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">deteriorates</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">there&#39;s a constant recycling but now</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">the biologists of course had to fit</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">the the standard model of physics</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">because physics had been</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">designated the leading science and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">rest were all subsidiary</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">so biology had to show how this struggle</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">for life can happen against the wash</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">away tide</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">and so the darwinian theory was very</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">slanted toward this endless competition</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">and scarcity but if you looked at nature</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">you saw so much cooperation going all</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">the all</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">everywhere including our own bodies with</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">50 trillion cells that work in concert</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">our body function of those cells we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">fighting each other when that happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">we&#39;re sick</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">right so everything you look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">once you you get over the prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">of of only darwinian theory you see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">balance and indeed i noticed that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">russians</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.959" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">were teaching evolution biology through</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">krapat</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">propulkin&#39;s book mutual aid which was</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">cooperative site and then both the east</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">and the west</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">politicized this so that the soviets</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">were asking people to sacrifice their</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">individuality for community and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">capitalists were sacrificing community</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">and it was very frustrating because if</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">they only put the two together</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">like putting gravitation and radiation</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">they&#39;d have a complete view what do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">what do you because um well</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">member of the evolutionary leader circle</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">and and actually one of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">um supported me in um being invited</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">into that circle um i recently talked to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">david sloane wilson</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">and um he very much is walking that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">tightrope of of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">being a respectable academic in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">the current system trying to lean</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">himself out of the window as far as he</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">can within the orthodoxy of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">environment that he works in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">um but what he&#39;s trying to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">to rescue um out of a misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">darwinism and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">and a much broader view of darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">selection the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">variation selection and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">um replication as the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">the darwinian process and and then with</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">idea that he developed with eo wilson of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">multi-level selection he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">bringing in that there are layers of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">competitive behavior and at the group</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">um and the group level goes up all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">way to the large group of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">the planetary process there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">selection</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">towards cooperation and and pro</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">social behavior as he calls it um do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">think he&#39;s on on</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">on the track there or what&#39;s he sure yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">and he does it very cleverly because he</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">he preserves the darwinian struggle of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">the individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">against individual until you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">but the way you get a functioning group</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">is when the individuals stop</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:50.320" style="s2">fighting each other and cooperate right</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">the first instance of moving from</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">cooperation to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">uh from competition to cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">was when the ancient bacteria who ruled</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">the earth for</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">uh half of evolution two out of four</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">billion years of living evolution only</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">and very competitive and feisty in many</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">and eventually they got together and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">formed the cooperative we know as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">nucleated cell</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">where the different kinds of bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">that were incorporated gave up some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">their own dna to a central library we</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">call the nucleus</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">and kept just enough as in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">mitochondria you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">to keep functioning within that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">but basically gave up their freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">be in the community</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">and then because that cell was new on</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">the planet it had to go through its own</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">what i call youthful phase</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">again being feisty and very inventive in</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">competitive phase and eventually another</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">billion years go by and they form</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">multi-celled creatures as their</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">so these are the two big leaps so far in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">then you can fast forward to humans</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">because we are multi-celled creatures</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">and we learned in school</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">you know the life comes out of the sea</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">and the dinosaurs the flowers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">all of those things uh we learned in</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">school that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">that one that one-fourth of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">was what has been taught to people</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">in in western science as evolution the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">rest the earlier three-quarters</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">evolution was called primeval sludge or</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">uh i mean almost every protein in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">world today was invented in the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">microbial world</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">and we are only now learning how much we</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">depend on that microbial world</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">that without our gut bacteria and our</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">skin bacteria we cannot stay healthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:48.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re also part of the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">by which we actually switch</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.960" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">on and off certain genes and change</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:55.679" style="s2">gene activity and basically what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">expresses us</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.679" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">and the formation of new cells through</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">the integration</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">bacteria like um as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">earlier like most</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">most of the cells in our body aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">even human um</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">we&#39;re walking ecosystems ten times as</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">many bacteria as nucleated cells</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">and now we&#39;re still there&#39;s a total</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">misunderstanding of the viral</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">because the viruses are just as</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">important to us as the bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">and every one of our cells people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">realize this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">our cells are bathed in a liquid that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">between the cells</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">and they think of them as rivers</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">floating through these</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">densely packed islands and every cell in</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">your body is spitting out</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">viruses and fragments of viruses</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">plasmids they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">like dandruff 24 7 that constantly every</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">cell is emitting viruses</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">and the full-blown viruses have protein</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">coats and have</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">addresses and are sent up river to where</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">they should go</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">and if the wrong party opens the thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">it can cause</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">problems or if there are imbalances</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">every traditional medical system again</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">was about balance</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">the balance of opposite forces but</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">western science doesn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">balance not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:17.039" style="s2">at its most fundamental level it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">know about balance</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.039" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">and so so we no longer have a medical</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">system in which we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">rebalancing the system</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">even though everyone in the medical</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">knows that the only way to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">things like the new pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">is to have a strong immune system and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">that immune system is run by your</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">bacteria and your bacteria function</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">through a viral network of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">communications that they invented</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">i believe and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why we need to get our hands back</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">into the soil because that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">get into contact with beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">bacteria that that improve our immune</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">and i i&#39;m wondering have you come across</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">the word</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">and the work of um john stewart</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">a biologist in australia because he has</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">one sentence definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">evolutionary process that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">akin with with the work that you um</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">which is um evolution proceeds by</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">a process of diversification and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">subsequent reintegration of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">at higher levels of complexity what i</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">call the formation of community</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">and then comes the important sentence</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">that throughout the course of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">jump to reintegration at higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">normally happens through the evolutions</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">of new forms of collaboration and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:43.360" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">which is exactly it&#39;s exactly what i</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.360" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">call the maturation cycle</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">and we understand that same maturation</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">in an individual human</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">we expect our teenagers to be feisty and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">know it all and competitive and and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">to settle down to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">cooperative citizens of their community</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">i mean with the concept of maturation so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">i think it speaks to people</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">i i heard you speak um about this in one</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">and you actually which i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">beautiful the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">the way that you keep bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">that there is this jump but then the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">that new entity</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">goes through a juvenile face again and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">and in one place you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">this with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">the biggest yeah it&#39;s not as simple just</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">basically let me finish the sentence</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">briefly</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">um you were talking about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">context of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">agriculture and then building cities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">the whole era of empires was basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">on the one hand there is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:44.600" style="s2">super organism the city as a as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.600" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">multi-organismic entity but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">the cities as city-states building</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">empires</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">went through another competitive phase</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">so that would give us hope that even um</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">cities and could actually evolve into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">collaborative phase um in the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.640" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">yes you see when when they only talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">always larger group uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">larger forms of organization they miss</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">that fact that each new form</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">then has to go through its cycle again</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like a rebirth when a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">entity forms it&#39;s new it&#39;s young it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">to start again</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i think the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">maturation cycle helps us understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s happening with humanity</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">and i&#39;m glad you brought up the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">cities as cells because</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">uh the way to see how much we behave</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">like the ancient bacterial world is look</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">out of an airplane at a city by night or</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">by day</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">it looks exactly like a cell on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">substrate you see the nuclear hub</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">where there&#39;s a densest uh uh of of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">you know the the library and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">those functions and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">the pseudopods reach out into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">countryside where the food is brought in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">through the pseudopods of the amoeba if</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">and so that&#39;s very interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">because it shows you right away</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">that a city unless it has been an</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">infrastructure built overnight</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">in china or the middle east and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">people stuck into it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">that is not a natural city but cities</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">that grew up from villages to towns to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">cities</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">are exactly like cells growing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">so this tells me that the cities are</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">much more important to our human future</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">than nation states</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">which are completely arbitrary lines</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">scratched across</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">cultures on maps and and have</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">no bearing on ecosystems they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">nothing to do with the watersheds of</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">thing have you come across um the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">work of a biologist which is also</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">is basically the father of</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">that cities need to be planted from the</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">in the context of the river systems that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">connect the mountains to the sea</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">and and that that&#39;s where healthy city</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">development really needs to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">to be the drivers</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">of a re-regionalization at the</p>

<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">so we can match human activities in the</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">absolutely and you know it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">fascinating thing about living</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">on islands is that we can see that kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">of the rivers flowing out of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">mountains right you&#39;re on majorca and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.480" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">in hawaii and the hawaiians actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">did the perfect bioregionalism every</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">farm</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">went from the top of the mountain all</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">the way to the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">following streams the streams were the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">dividing lines between the farms</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">so every farm was like a narrow triangle</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">and each of them had access to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">seafood to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.840" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">to the fields where they grew the taro</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">and and made fish ponds inland</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">to up as high as where you got the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">lumber for building the houses and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">so all the farms were equal in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">bioregional sense and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">and this is not competitive this was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">division equitable division of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">uh of land and that was it was called</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">the ahupua a system</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">of the hawaiians and so when i teach my</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">mba students we talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">there there&#39;s a strong movement here to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">recreate that system</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">which of course has been completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">messed up by paving the water</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">sheds and and doing everything with</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">um because i i recently</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">through work that i&#39;ve been doing with</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">october and i met the delegation that</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">and through that i had this absolute</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">to them and they would then echo back</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">something that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">constantly in alignment like yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">talking about the same thing but we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">have you have you found that um because</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">it i&#39;m realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">the wisdom of the maori is really the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">wisdom of the pacific it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">navigators that that that built a system</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">that is just</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">so important for us to learn from i</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">would love</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">for you to speak to that yeah well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">in love with the polynesian navigators</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">and and uh their chief navigator is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">is a friend and uh they sailed around</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">the entire globe two years ago with no</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">compass</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">in in one of these canoes and the canoes</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">are never</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">uh solidly hammered together</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">every part is lashed to every other part</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">so that it can be flexible</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">in a storm on that doesn&#39;t break on the</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:10.159" style="s2">and these polynesian navigators</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">had umpteen ways of reading nature to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.159" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">know where they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">they understood nature so well in fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">that they could not be lost</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:19.279" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t just the stars because</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">sometimes for weeks you can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">stars</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">but you know the wave patterns and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">fish patterns and the floating seaweed</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">and the clouds that form over islands</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">and when all else fails they say stand</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">tall in your canoe until you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">they say raise your consciousness up to</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">which brings us to a whole other aspect</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">of nature that western science doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">which is consciousness but i i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">want to get quite there yet but i want</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">to say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">i was a co-founder of something we</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">called the worldwide indigenous science</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">and we founded this for two reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">learn from native peoples their sciences</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:07.120" style="s2">and to let young native people know that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">their cultures did legitimate sciences</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.120" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">uh way back before western science was</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">born</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">and and they understood all of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">things about how to get along in nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of funny for them</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">to see us white people from the western</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">world you come along</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">and and figure these things out right</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">when they have known them for as long as</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">they&#39;ve been around</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">and i want to speak specifically to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">concept of democracy here</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a very wonderful book by jack</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">weatherfield</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:44.000" style="s2">called uh indian givers and that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">course a play on when we say</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">indian givers we mean somebody dishonest</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">who is not going to give you fair</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">but he is saying oh but the western</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">world has learned so much from indians</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">and we gave it all freely and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">things they gave us</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">was how to do a democracy now the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">founding fathers of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">were exactly on the turf of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">hodnashoni</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">indian people native americans who had</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">unified</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">six warring nations under a great law of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">peace for many centuries that had no</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">more wars</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">and had a completely representative</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">democracy</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">and uh and benjamin franklin one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">founding fathers of the u.s constitution</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">was the only one</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">who bothered to really get to understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.039" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">their great law of peace and their</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">way their political system and he kept</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">telling his fellows</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to copy this you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">copy this this is really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">there was no democracy to copy from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">came from the ancient greeks of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">but as we know that was a slaveholding</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">society that wasn&#39;t exactly democratic</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">women were not enfranchised neither were</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">the slaves</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">you know but the haudenosaunee included</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">everyone women and children and seven</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:03.519" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">into the future with every deliberation</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">you make now</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">if a man wanted to propose war he had to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">walk into parliament wearing a skirt</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.640" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">and carrying a corn grinding bowl to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">remind people what war would do to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">food supply and the women and children</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">and so they had no more wars</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">these things are completely you know we</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">the only thing that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">founding fathers of the us took from</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">them was</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">the balance of powers the tripartite</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.279" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">in checks and balances against each</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">other but they left out women children</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">in the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">and nature uh which was so important</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">and so if we furthermore they also</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">uh put in the vote and voting</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">is a divisive way of doing a multi-party</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">yes nature has has opposites nature is</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">profoundly conservative with</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">things that work well and radically</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">creative when things don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">when they how to make something work</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">that should be a friendly collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">not a hostility between opposing parties</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">that you vote every year whether to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">this one or that one</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">you always have to be conservative and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">radical</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">and it must be by agreement so</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">if we could only have the great law of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">peace</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">we would have a real democracy i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">saying and they figured it out so long</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve experienced that in in my</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">apprenticeship in the way of council</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">with gigi coyle and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">and others from from the ohio foundation</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">where and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">really the the way of sitting in council</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">is not you don&#39;t come to a final</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">agreement that you then put</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">put to a vote you just hear all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">voices and all the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">to the point that the collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">intelligence the container you formed</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">with the council</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">informs everyone to a point that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">even if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have a one sentence</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">this is what we&#39;ve decided everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">is in resonance and understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">what now needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">so very often i mean gigi even tells the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">story that in the early</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">councils with with western mindset</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">developers and so on</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">they they kind of never understood</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:20.480" style="s2">where&#39;s the decision</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">um but but all the indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.480" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">said well it&#39;s obvious after the council</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">um um but i i i wanted to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">i did by the way we reflect that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">quaker meetings</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a close thing they probably learned</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">but i didn&#39;t know you you created this</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:40.320" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">um of indigenous sciences but what i do</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.320" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">know is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve done a piece of work that i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">hasn&#39;t got enough attention and that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">so critical</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">for the future of humanity and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">it will be re-edited</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">at a much larger scale the work that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">did with this japanese foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:02.800" style="s2">initially bringing eastern and western</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">science together</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.800" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">and then also running another symposium</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">where you work with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">islamic sciences and what i love about</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">this approach is that you from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">beginning say</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">you&#39;re basically appreciating multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">without dismissing any of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">but um i think you have this wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">image of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">of a keyboard um can you tell a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">bit more about that story</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">yes the one thing that that scientists</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">physicists all over the world seem to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">agree on is that the universe is made of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">vibrations</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">of waves and so it seemed reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">to take a keyboard as a as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">uh for a sequence of frequencies from</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">low to high or high to low depending</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">which way you look at the keyboard which</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">end you start from</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:54.560" style="s2">and when you when you do that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.560" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">reflect the taoist view i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:01.200" style="s2">taoism before</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">because they had a matter energy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">sequence</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">and so i say the low keys are matter the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">slow vibrations</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">it&#39;s generally agreed on that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">where matter should reside on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">not in the high frequencies but in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">low ones and as you move up the keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">you get to electromagnetic energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">which was considered non-real in western</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">science until it could be measured</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">before that it was like a stage show</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">animal magnetism being demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">things like that and so then that came</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">into western science and we&#39;re up the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">keyboard as far as what we call</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">zero point energy that background</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">vibration</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">in the whole universe and but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">get any further because things get less</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">and less material</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">as you go up and in the higher case you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">have mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">and spirit and consciousness now the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">easter the western ones</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">start from the matter end as i said but</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">they get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">part way up the keyboard because they</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">cannot measure the non-physical</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">vibrations</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">the eastern sciences and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">philosophies all started at the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">end in a sea of consciousness basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">and slow the vibrations down to get the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">rest of the keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">so they don&#39;t have a problem seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">entire keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">and i often say when people say it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">important now for us to raise our</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">vibrations</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">don&#39;t forget to play in the low keys</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">because the point of raising your</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">vibrations is to expand your keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">and if you lose the lower vibrations</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">then you&#39;re stuck up there with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">angels</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">who are envious of of human bodies</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">which is which is one of the really big</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">issues in in the kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">enlightened circles is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">too few people who have an imminent</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">spirituality and too many who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">talking about transcendent spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">losing themselves in kind of belly</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">gazing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">and yes the connection with them</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">losing the connection with nature and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">really our</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">job is to bring cosmic love down to our</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">physical toes not just our minds not</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">just even our hearts but all the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">down to our toes</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">we must do this now about the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">different sciences</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">once i could see that you could get</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">completely opposite</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">statements out of a science that starts</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">at one end or the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">and by the way the quantum theorists</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">in western physics bumped into</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">not being able to explain what they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">with the assumptions of western science</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">that this is a purely material universe</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">and that you can look at it objectively</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">and that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">comes out of matter those are all basic</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">axioms of western science so they</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">turned to vedic science from india to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">explain their own results</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">and that became known that was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">origin of what we call the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">shift right that we&#39;re still working on</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s why on my first uh symposium</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">which was funded in japan</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">by this wonderful uh sponsor um</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">akio uh oh gosh</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">and now i can&#39;t think his name last name</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">anyway he uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">what we did was invite</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">people with western phd western science</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">phds who had made the paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">so that they understood what the axioms</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">that they were taught</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">where were and also what the new axioms</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">they adopted from vedic science were</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:44.720" style="s2">and could compare the two and i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">looking for how do we bridge</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.720" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">this gap but then i realized suddenly it</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">was like an epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">why should i not allow both of those and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">show the world how one science can lead</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">you to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">consciousness is a late emergent product</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">of material evolution</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">in other words matter gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">consciousness while another science with</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">a different set of assumptions says</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">no consciousness gives rise to matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">absolutely opposite views</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">right and i used to talk about this uh a</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">lot with</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">with leading edge you know paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">shift kinds of science</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">as scientists um and so then i said well</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s see if we can get another</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">uh to write out their axioms right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s how kuala lumpur happened</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">for uh inviting islamic scientists and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">philosophers of science</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">and at first they were completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">confused what was i trying to get them</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">to do to write down what</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">their axiom what were the guardians but</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">eventually they did it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">distilled the three sciences into ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">uh statements so every science has</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">a world view made up of a set of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">concepts because</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t study nature as a scientist if</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:41:00.800" style="s2">you have no idea what is a net what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">nature what&#39;s a universe</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.800" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">you must have a fundamental worldview</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">about what it is you&#39;re studying in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">order to study it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">so you prejudice the case from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">beginning but it&#39;s the only way you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">possibly have a science</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">right you can&#39;t make a theory if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re making a theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">so that so then we had the three and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">then i my</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">the fourth one on my agenda was taoist</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">which i haven&#39;t brought into being yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">and then indigenous sciences</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">would be very important to add and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">eventually we might end up with a single</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">but i think we must go through the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">importance of recognizing diversity</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">it&#39;s part of this whole thing of coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">recognizing that racism is holding up</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">everything that when you do not treat</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">everyone in the global family</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">as a beloved equal other human on the</p>

<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">and see nature the same way so if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">stopped making war</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">on each other and on nature and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">stopped racism which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">almost a prerequisite to stopping war if</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:10.319" style="s2">we could get those two things out of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">way we&#39;d be a very long way to a better</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">climate change or not have you have you</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:18.880" style="s2">like the work so far the the the three</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">sets of axioms have they been written up</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">is it like</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">people i haven&#39;t i have them as a single</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">page i can send you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">that would be wonderful and is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">is there a website that i can</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">refer people to where they could um</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">i will post it on my website i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">think to do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">and out of the work with islamic</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">scientists was it with</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">out of that work that you also developed</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">this project of looking at what would a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">new economics</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">based on learning from life&#39;s principles</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">or how long right because</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">because uh western science uh was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:57.200" style="s2">materialist science</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">eastern science was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.200" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">consciousness-based science and islamic</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">science to my surprise</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">was the science of a living universe</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">their number one statement is allah</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">created the universe</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">their number two statement is and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">told us to study it</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">to study the living universe and i said</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">to them you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">in order to put yourselves on the map</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">demonstrate that you can do something</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">western science has been unable to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">and i can tell you right now that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:31.760" style="s2">have no science of economics</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">economics is not a science in in western</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.760" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">it tends to be but it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">it does not have it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">same kind of axioms and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">and theorems and proofs you know to call</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">it a science</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t study things the same way but</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">in the living universe with living</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">nature as your primary</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:57.119" style="s2">uh object of study they could do one</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">because nature&#39;s been doing economics</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.119" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">from the get-go</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">what is an an economy takes resources</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">transforms them into goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">distributes consumes and recycles we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">all of those except the recycling part</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">right which is the big big flaw</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">and why we cannot call ourselves a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">science of economics</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">but they could do that and then i say</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">don&#39;t replace western science in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">with islamic science teach them side by</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">so that people can see how different</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">assumptions lead to different sciences</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">and respect them all until we get</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">together strongly enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">to maybe be able to do our checks and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">balances within a single science</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">so what what would you say are the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">lessons that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">as because now finally um i remember</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">i mean you were also involved in um</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">helping to create</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">the guy education curriculum and um</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">the initial version of the online course</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">worked with for many years um</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">and back when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">brought out that course in 2007 or eight</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">it was really quite heretical in terms</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">the critique of the current growth</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">economics and and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:23.119" style="s2">the dogma of conventional um economics</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">and what i&#39;ve observed in the last 10 12</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.119" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">years is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s become absolutely okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">to say that the current economic system</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">is broken and we need to reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">system and and people in very</p>

<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">saying that now even all the way up to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">the imf um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">and and there are all these wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">would you say are the key lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">life from biology</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">and from from ecosystems that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:05.839" style="s2">have in mind when we</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">when we redesign um our economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.839" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">well i think it&#39;s very you know you</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">can&#39;t separate politics from economics</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">and so this this concept of having a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">rule by the people for the people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">that literally is what democracy means</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">in greek rule by the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">that the people must recognize that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">have to have both conservative that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">you&#39;re always seeking balance between</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">right and uh and the same thing has to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">go for a health care system we only have</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">a sickness care system at present</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">which is unfortunately so profitable</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s very difficult to dent</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t so long ago that we had an</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">actual health care system</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">in fact homeopathy was taught in medical</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.240" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">schools across the u.s not too long ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a statute of hahnemann in</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">to completely drug-based medicine so we</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">have to look</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">how can we achieve the kind of balance</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">that where we don&#39;t destroy ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">so that the wrong viruses leap onto us</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">as lifeboats and so that we make peace</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">with the micro world rather than trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">to</p>

<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">and so we have to look to to democracy</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.920" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">politics and to health care and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">and to all of these things that we want</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">and as i said before</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">if we could get rid of racism and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">warfare</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">those two things then i think and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">establish</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">a real democracy and i see this</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">happening in the chrysalis of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">shutdown at present that people</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:04.319" style="s2">first they elevate caregivers to heroism</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">not military figures not some big</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">scientists but</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">caregivers the ambulance drivers and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.839" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">nurses and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">and the farmers sharing food with each</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">other as people lose their jobs and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">economy goes to park</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">that we can take care of each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">again as in my childhood now i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">another great depression</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">again and unfortunately i don&#39;t i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">organic family farms this time but we</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">must recreate them as you so well know</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">and as you&#39;re working so hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">so i say you know there are many many i</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">i like</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">two roomy quotes so much one is why do</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">you stay in prison when the door is so</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">wide open</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">and the other is there are a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">ways to kneel and kiss the earth</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">that whether you are an or want to be an</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">organic farmer or</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">or go out and register voters for an</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">or fix computers or write songs or</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">makes your heart sing think of how you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">can make that contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">the world that we all want the peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">equitable</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">flourishing world the thriving world</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">that we want</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">and then together i think we can adapt</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">this massive climate change and things</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">and that we won&#39;t have these pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">if we have strong immune systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">and come back into balance with nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:29.280" style="s2">it really is doable i in in</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">honesty i believe our populations will</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.280" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">be dramatically reduced by the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">because we have waited too long already</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">think of yourself and your children and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">your grandchildren</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">as survivors they are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">potential survivors</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">if we go back to bioregionalism as</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">you&#39;re practicing now daniel</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">it is the only way to go and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:56.839" style="s2">it&#39;s doable and i think the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">cosmos is on our side wanting us to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.839" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">mature</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">into rebalancing with nature the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">indigenous people we have as role models</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">but they never had to do it at a global</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">that is what is new that is what we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:18.640" style="s2">and we have things like the internet now</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">we can do it we zoom like crazy these</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">days and people like eric whittaker can</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">can put ever more thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">into the same choir harmonizing each</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">you know these are these are important</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">things that are tools on our way now</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">yeah i mean garden too</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">the the political principle of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">subsidiarity of of really</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">enabling people at</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">the community and regional scale to make</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.280" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">the decisions that are meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">their future and their children</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">and all other forms of government</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">governance being</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">subsidiary to that in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">they only have coordinating functions</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">and make sure that there&#39;s global</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">solidarity in this process</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">that&#39;s really the the political</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">organization that would enable people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">like a lot of politicians talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">citizens participation but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">a system particularly because our</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">economic system that actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">enables um true participation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">and and also i always find that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">a caveat to that which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">if you hand over participation before</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:26.960" style="s2">you also</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.960" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">engage in a decolonialization of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.960" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">mind and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">and eco-literacy building then you what</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">you get back from</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">a participatory democracy is what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">junk that we&#39;ve been putting in</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">um to people for the last 30 40 years in</p>
