<p begin="00:11:41.879" end="00:11:46.829" style="s2">hands-on on some of these international</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.249" end="00:11:50.369" style="s2">issues the rise of China right you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.829" end="00:11:53.309" style="s2">and joining the military I felt was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.369" end="00:11:55.049" style="s2">was an interesting way to do that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.309" end="00:11:56.489" style="s2">Navy was the one that had the most sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.049" end="00:11:59.489" style="s2">of international footprint</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.489" end="00:12:01.619" style="s2">you don&#39;t really I mean we have Air</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.619" end="00:12:05.339" style="s2">obviously the world you know obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.989" end="00:12:08.910" style="s2">little bit more than I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.339" end="00:12:12.179" style="s2">probably and but the Navy is really the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.910" end="00:12:13.259" style="s2">one that conducts a lot of diplomacy for</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.179" end="00:12:16.290" style="s2">the United States and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.259" end="00:12:17.399" style="s2">attracted me to Naval Service and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.290" end="00:12:18.689" style="s2">know from the start and that when I</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.399" end="00:12:20.369" style="s2">explained it that my skill said they</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.350" end="00:12:31.619" style="s2">and walk in I literally did literally</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:32.910" style="s2">did the the so and this is to that to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.619" end="00:12:34.350" style="s2">your point and when I said earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.910" end="00:12:37.410" style="s2">I did everything backwards my life</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.350" end="00:12:40.470" style="s2">series backwards is I had was the first</p>

<p begin="00:14:46.070" end="00:14:50.150" style="s2">had finished my degree prior to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.170" end="00:14:52.520" style="s2">which is right as anyone will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.150" end="00:14:55.460" style="s2">is the absolute backwards way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.520" end="00:14:58.790" style="s2">anything but was that hard was that hard</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.460" end="00:15:00.500" style="s2">to be enlisted with your degree knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.790" end="00:15:02.420" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna you know ultimately end up</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.530" end="00:15:17.090" style="s2">the fact that I got to do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.420" end="00:15:19.340" style="s2">and understanding I&#39;ve seen both sides</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.090" end="00:15:21.530" style="s2">of the coin now and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.340" end="00:15:23.690" style="s2">the at the officer level your manager</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.530" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">right you&#39;re you&#39;re managing the people</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.640" end="00:15:38.020" style="s2">officer level it just doesn&#39;t come up as</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.770" end="00:15:40.180" style="s2">much so being in intelligence that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.400" end="00:15:54.279" style="s2">would have been down there but it would</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">have been in a managerial capacity right</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.279" end="00:15:59.560" style="s2">sorry so let&#39;s go from enlisted to</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.910" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">was a there was an army unit that was</p>

<p begin="00:17:10.390" end="00:17:14.920" style="s2">they look for you know you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.150" end="00:17:16.810" style="s2">what&#39;s called mobilization ready</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.920" end="00:17:18.730" style="s2">and so mobilization ready means you have</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.460" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">needed for you to be able to mobilize to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.440" end="00:17:42.340" style="s2">conduct that deployment and so I had</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.070" end="00:18:33.700" style="s2">your perception of Guantanamo Bay to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:36.580" style="s2">it sounds like a medieval dungeon right</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.120" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">have the beards right but that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.530" end="00:19:15.340" style="s2">religious purposes that&#39;s not because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">solid shape they they want the beards</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:46.900" style="s2">al Qaeda members right so the training</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.590" end="00:19:51.940" style="s2">they give you is essentially this idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.900" end="00:19:55.150" style="s2">of how to debrief someone through what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.940" end="00:19:56.190" style="s2">called rapport building tactics and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.150" end="00:20:00.510" style="s2">do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.190" end="00:20:03.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s this Hollywood narrative of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.510" end="00:20:05.890" style="s2">interrogation which you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.640" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">really thank I guess Gianna Hospital and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.890" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld for</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.320" end="00:20:13.950" style="s2">skewing and is that everyone thinks of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:16.450" style="s2">the CIA&#39;s version of interrogation as</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.950" end="00:20:20.679" style="s2">what we do right but I was military</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.450" end="00:20:23.380" style="s2">intelligence so their stuff was enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.679" end="00:20:28.090" style="s2">interrogation of waterboarding stress</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.380" end="00:20:30.610" style="s2">positions you know really extreme kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.090" end="00:20:32.370" style="s2">of tactics us guys in the military and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.610" end="00:20:38.260" style="s2">uniform we don&#39;t do any of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.370" end="00:20:41.910" style="s2">our version of interrogation is form a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.260" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">relationship with this person build a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.910" end="00:20:48.429" style="s2">connection with them one on one and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:50.050" style="s2">through the course of that connection</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.429" end="00:20:52.900" style="s2">through the course of that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.050" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">over time hold conversations with them a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.900" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">series of conversations with them that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">you can use this all in classified by</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:00.550" style="s2">the way you could you can go look this</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:03.190" style="s2">up it&#39;s also in how to win friends and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.550" end="00:21:04.870" style="s2">influence people oh is it good it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.190" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">the generals yeah it&#39;s the same idea and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.870" end="00:21:09.340" style="s2">then through the course of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:11.080" style="s2">manipulate the conversation in certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.340" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">ways where you can get the information</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.080" end="00:21:17.559" style="s2">that you want so you know classic</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:19.420" style="s2">example that we would use is you know if</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.559" end="00:21:21.700" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get a number from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.420" end="00:21:22.929" style="s2">girl at a bar right or I guess these</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.700" end="00:21:30.850" style="s2">days you might even say her Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.929" end="00:21:32.200" style="s2">page does anything and and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.850" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">example I always used so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.200" end="00:21:35.410" style="s2">trying to get a number from a girl at a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:37.300" style="s2">bar you&#39;re not just gonna walk up to her</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.410" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">and start screaming give me your number</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.300" end="00:21:42.730" style="s2">tell me tell me what the digits are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:44.950" style="s2">know that it&#39;s not gonna work very well</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.730" end="00:21:46.690" style="s2">no right and and if it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.950" end="00:21:47.970" style="s2">girl who does respond well to that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.690" end="00:21:50.860" style="s2">probably want to call that number right</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.970" end="00:21:52.510" style="s2">exactly or or you know to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.860" end="00:21:54.760" style="s2">analogy going it could be could be fake</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.510" end="00:21:57.550" style="s2">right exactly be fake we have many other</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.760" end="00:21:59.530" style="s2">things right so you want to go up to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.550" end="00:22:02.590" style="s2">them and maybe you tell an anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.530" end="00:22:04.870" style="s2">maybe you make some quippy reference to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.590" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">something that&#39;s going on in the room or</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.870" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">you start people watching what you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">you do anything you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">to sort of sideways get closer to them</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:18.490" style="s2">talk it up to them you know some people</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:21.850" style="s2">use pickup lines but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.490" end="00:22:23.529" style="s2">recommend that these are this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.850" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">called an indirect opener yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.529" end="00:22:29.169" style="s2">wren direct up exactly and you and at</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:31.029" style="s2">Guantanamo Bay for example obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.169" end="00:22:32.769" style="s2">know they know who they are and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.029" end="00:22:34.990" style="s2">know who you are when you you know when</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.769" end="00:22:40.539" style="s2">you&#39;re walking it so it&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.990" end="00:22:43.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t is not as indirect in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.539" end="00:22:45.669" style="s2">right but so throughout the course of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.240" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">the training its role-playing so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.669" end="00:22:50.289" style="s2">lot of role-playing of you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.509" style="s2">it&#39;s role-playing it&#39;s all recorded by</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.289" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">your teachers and if you screw up it</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.710" end="00:23:07.090" style="s2">before at least outside of the military</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.809" end="00:23:11.259" style="s2">I&#39;ve been said of publicly but I can so</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">a few minutes I can kind of get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:13.870" style="s2">of what their style is and then I try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:15.730" style="s2">you know in my own Jack mazovick way you</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.070" end="00:29:25.690" style="s2">there&#39;s cameras there&#39;s microphones but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.290" end="00:29:28.420" style="s2">when they see someone who puts them at</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.690" end="00:29:29.680" style="s2">ease it puts them in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.420" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">they&#39;re able to open it up more and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.680" end="00:29:31.030" style="s2">think you get a much better interview</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.120" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.030" end="00:29:36.040" style="s2">ya know no question about it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.120" end="00:29:38.920" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating to me that these</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.040" end="00:29:41.380" style="s2">communication skills are just so</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.920" end="00:29:43.420" style="s2">prevalent and useful everywhere and</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.420" end="00:29:47.290" style="s2">of those things like sales and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:48.550" style="s2">accounting everybody should learn a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.290" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">little oh yeah a little bit of both of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.550" end="00:29:52.360" style="s2">those no matter what your job is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:54.010" style="s2">be because basically everything is sales</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.360" end="00:29:55.780" style="s2">everything has some accounting in it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.010" end="00:29:58.090" style="s2">everything everything really does boil</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.780" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">down to communication especially today</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.090" end="00:30:04.660" style="s2">in our world of competing narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">storylines and the the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.660" end="00:30:09.640" style="s2">message and of ideas and so continue on</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.640" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">cuz I want to get and we&#39;ll say this for</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.700" end="00:30:20.200" style="s2">the one bit that&#39;s a little different is</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.259" end="00:32:23.849" style="s2">course and then so they try to match up</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.639" end="00:32:26.820" style="s2">people&#39;s personalities ages genders</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.849" end="00:32:28.619" style="s2">races with you know different people to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.820" end="00:32:30.239" style="s2">see what works and what doesn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.619" end="00:32:32.190" style="s2">a lot of a lot of it it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.239" end="00:32:33.509" style="s2">messenger - right right so with</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.190" end="00:32:35.700" style="s2">depending on the age you might get</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.509" end="00:32:36.659" style="s2">someone who&#39;s very young with someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.700" end="00:32:38.219" style="s2">who&#39;s very old you know you&#39;ve got like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.659" end="00:32:40.049" style="s2">a student teacher kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.219" end="00:32:41.369" style="s2">right or you might have the reverse mate</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.049" end="00:32:42.869" style="s2">if someone is old very young so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.369" end="00:32:44.429" style="s2">student-teacher angle goat that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.869" end="00:32:47.700" style="s2">almost like like a mentor or like a know</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.429" end="00:32:49.529" style="s2">sort of thing and so it&#39;s it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.700" end="00:32:50.820" style="s2">agreed upon beforehand you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.529" end="00:32:52.830" style="s2">a plan you you have to have a plan and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.820" end="00:32:55.379" style="s2">legally you actually need that as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">that it needs to be written down and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.379" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">obviously because of the CIA&#39;s enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:04.529" style="s2">interrogation plan a lot of laws were</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:06.599" style="s2">passed congressionally to control what</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.529" end="00:33:08.429" style="s2">gets done on on our end even though</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.599" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">nobody in military intelligence was</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.429" end="00:33:13.260" style="s2">involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:15.240" style="s2">so legally speaking it has to be down on</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.260" end="00:33:18.840" style="s2">paper what&#39;s going to happen prior to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.240" end="00:33:20.490" style="s2">then a it&#39;s all recorded during we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.840" end="00:33:23.100" style="s2">even touch that recording we can&#39;t watch</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.490" end="00:33:25.830" style="s2">it afterwards that&#39;s it&#39;s all preserved</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.100" end="00:33:26.970" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s out there it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.830" end="00:33:30.510" style="s2">think it gets it gets sent out to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.970" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">somewhere in the NSA and then after</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.510" end="00:33:34.260" style="s2">which you know you do like a full-on</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:36.360" style="s2">debrief with your you know what went</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.260" end="00:33:37.290" style="s2">well what was wrong what screwed up what</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.360" end="00:33:38.790" style="s2">could you have done better</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.290" end="00:33:40.050" style="s2">were there any leads that you picked up</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.790" end="00:33:44.340" style="s2">was there information that you picked up</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.050" end="00:33:46.200" style="s2">that kind of thing so that is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.340" end="00:33:49.650" style="s2">interrogation session right without any</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.200" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">of the you know details of it as far as</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.650" end="00:33:53.720" style="s2">arriving for the first time see thank</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.710" end="00:34:02.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing so you were on the base</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.350" end="00:34:06.180" style="s2">and there&#39;s a big bay obviously going</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.970" end="00:34:08.580" style="s2">some of a and you know we can&#39;t go off</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.180" end="00:34:09.929" style="s2">the base there&#39;s no even after Obama and</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.790" end="00:34:19.610" style="s2">used to have this joke to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.929" end="00:34:19.610" style="s2">Guantanamo Bay Cuba close but no cigar</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:27.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s not on the east side of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:30.540" style="s2">island I guess on uh south east south</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.960" end="00:34:32.640" style="s2">east south east so towards like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.540" end="00:34:38.160" style="s2">Dominican in Puerto Rico over there and</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.290" end="00:34:48.540" style="s2">the east side of the bay and that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.020" end="00:34:52.020" style="s2">ferry ride is about about 30 2530</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.540" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">minutes as you&#39;re crossing over and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.020" end="00:34:56.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like any other military base when</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.940" end="00:34:58.860" style="s2">you first arrive you know there&#39;s a shop</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.730" end="00:35:00.540" style="s2">at there&#39;s you know a little little</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:16.850" style="s2">foot and which was linked it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.120" end="00:35:19.560" style="s2">essentially a like a conex box almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.850" end="00:35:21.510" style="s2">shared with another guy and then there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:22.930" end="00:35:26.200" style="s2">as toilet and shower that we would use</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.609" end="00:35:27.339" style="s2">so like you would walk through that and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.200" end="00:35:30.069" style="s2">then you could walk into the next room</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.339" end="00:35:31.510" style="s2">over so it was a 2-bedroom 1-bath</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.770" end="00:35:41.049" style="s2">yeah so that that part of Cuba it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.190" end="00:35:44.109" style="s2">actually considered almost a desert</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.049" end="00:35:45.609" style="s2">because of essentially a lot of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.109" end="00:35:47.049" style="s2">a lot of mountains on the other side of</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.690" end="00:38:42.099" style="s2">like that enough time to take like 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.030" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">shots about an hour yeah that was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.099" end="00:38:47.140" style="s2">first batch of detainees that ever</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:50.109" style="s2">arrived at Guantanamo and they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.140" end="00:38:52.119" style="s2">waiting in processing and so they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.109" end="00:38:53.800" style="s2">held like that I got it for about an</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.119" end="00:38:56.020" style="s2">hour before they were moved into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.800" end="00:38:59.109" style="s2">facility right well that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.020" end="00:39:01.510" style="s2">great example of the way that single</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.109" end="00:39:03.369" style="s2">moments and time snapshots get</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.510" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">transmitted around the world used over</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.369" end="00:39:07.000" style="s2">and over again to tell stories and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">changing narratives manipulate people</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.000" end="00:39:13.480" style="s2">start wars get people elected etc you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:15.580" style="s2">know you know a little so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.480" end="00:39:19.060" style="s2">definitely circles so circle back you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.580" end="00:39:20.410" style="s2">know walking up it&#39;s it&#39;s all blocked</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.060" end="00:39:21.880" style="s2">off you have to go through you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.410" end="00:39:23.619" style="s2">numerous security checks before you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.880" end="00:39:27.339" style="s2">in I mean if there&#39;s not a moat I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.619" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">really care so there kind of is and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.339" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">mode is called the Caribbean Sea oh so</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:36.910" style="s2">the the facility itself is right on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:38.859" style="s2">ocean so I mean it&#39;s there&#39;s a detention</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.910" end="00:39:41.770" style="s2">facility and you can see on Google Maps</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.859" end="00:39:43.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s a detention facility and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.770" end="00:39:45.849" style="s2">then maybe a hundred-yard less than a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.990" end="00:39:46.630" style="s2">hundred yards maybe maybe 50 yards and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.849" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.630" end="00:39:51.910" style="s2">a sheer rock face and then just waves</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:54.999" style="s2">dang and then just just open ocean after</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.910" end="00:39:56.589" style="s2">that so if you&#39;re in the top level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.999" end="00:39:58.269" style="s2">the facility looking out one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.589" end="00:40:01.390" style="s2">windows you can actually see the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.269" end="00:40:03.579" style="s2">oh okay so view and as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.390" end="00:40:04.930" style="s2">they use that as sort of like a reward</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.579" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">for good behavior huh</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.930" end="00:40:07.809" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s room with the view tell daddy</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:09.430" style="s2">what he wants to know and I&#39;ll let you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.809" end="00:40:13.809" style="s2">have the good room I&#39;m not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.430" end="00:40:15.759" style="s2">that more like just just good behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.809" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">in general right right so you know not</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.759" end="00:40:19.900" style="s2">reward for providing information but</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:22.299" style="s2">reward for did you follow all the rules</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.900" end="00:40:24.190" style="s2">how many demerits do you have did you</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.299" end="00:40:26.170" style="s2">put your dish in the dishwasher did you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.190" end="00:40:28.809" style="s2">put your dish in the dishwasher did you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.170" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">did you get in any fights with any of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.809" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">the other detainees because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.039" style="s2">lot of it&#39;s communal living right</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:35.259" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two facilities one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.039" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">communal living and then one is more a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.259" end="00:40:39.609" style="s2">single cell and then that is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">separated by the other house this idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.609" end="00:40:46.119" style="s2">of you know good behavior right and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:47.529" style="s2">it it looks like any other modern prison</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.119" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">that you&#39;ve seen with one notable</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.529" end="00:40:51.999" style="s2">exception one extremely notable</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">exception is the fact that everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.999" end="00:40:58.420" style="s2">there is the same religion and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:41:00.219" style="s2">is in general in a general scope from</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.420" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">the same part of the world right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.219" end="00:41:03.729" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s difference between</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.259" style="s2">Arabs and Afghans and Pashtun and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.729" end="00:41:06.940" style="s2">everything that complete difference</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.259" end="00:41:10.660" style="s2">between all that obviously with you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.940" end="00:41:13.660" style="s2">regional you know regional differences</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.660" end="00:41:15.999" style="s2">but everyone&#39;s in general from Middle</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.660" end="00:41:18.279" style="s2">East LaVon right compared to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.999" end="00:41:19.960" style="s2">perceptions of imprisons in America</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.279" end="00:41:21.759" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got like all the black</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.960" end="00:41:23.950" style="s2">folks on one side all the whites on</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.759" end="00:41:25.900" style="s2">another and the Latinos on another and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.950" end="00:41:27.489" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s you know that kind of stark</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.900" end="00:41:29.729" style="s2">difference is that we can easily relate</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.489" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">and then also the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.729" end="00:41:34.329" style="s2">issues that arise you know you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:36.519" style="s2">countless documentaries about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.329" end="00:41:38.890" style="s2">the rise of the the in prison gangs that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.519" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">then sort of form and the the rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.890" end="00:41:47.229" style="s2">that happen that does happen inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:49.089" style="s2">Guantanamo but it&#39;s not as stark because</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.229" end="00:41:51.579" style="s2">of the cultural similarity so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.089" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">so I mean like like the like the Saudis</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.579" end="00:41:55.749" style="s2">hate the Afghans because they consider</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:57.819" style="s2">them to be like Hicks you know but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.749" end="00:42:00.250" style="s2">the Iraqis don&#39;t like the Saudis because</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.819" end="00:42:02.830" style="s2">the because the Iraqis will say like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.250" end="00:42:05.260" style="s2">oh you know we had you know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.830" end="00:42:07.420" style="s2">just a bunch of Bedouins who you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.260" end="00:42:08.650" style="s2">happen to have oil and so you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.420" end="00:42:10.270" style="s2">know you&#39;re rich but you&#39;re still living</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.650" end="00:42:12.820" style="s2">in the third you know third century</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.270" end="00:42:16.330" style="s2">whereas we had Babylon you know right we</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.820" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">had the kingdom of uh you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.330" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:24.490" style="s2">nationalistic rivalry that still goes on</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:27.220" style="s2">then the bigger the bigger switch in</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.490" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">terms of all that would be sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.220" end="00:42:33.090" style="s2">more hardliners versus the moderates</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.260" end="00:42:36.580" style="s2">in terms of radical Islam so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.090" end="00:42:37.750" style="s2">do they you know are there are people in</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.580" end="00:42:39.730" style="s2">there that are still fighting the fight</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.750" end="00:42:41.320" style="s2">that are still waging the war right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.730" end="00:42:42.849" style="s2">there even though they&#39;ve been there you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.320" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">know ten fifteen years they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.849" end="00:42:48.700" style="s2">waging war on the United States from</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:50.650" style="s2">their perspective of radical Islam and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.700" end="00:42:53.230" style="s2">but there are also other ones who have</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.650" end="00:42:54.820" style="s2">decided that you know perhaps radical</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.230" end="00:42:57.490" style="s2">Islam wasn&#39;t the best choice to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.820" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">with their lives and and they&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.490" end="00:43:02.290" style="s2">moderated to the point of of saying look</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:04.599" style="s2">you know I still believe in Islam still</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.290" end="00:43:06.820" style="s2">Muslim but I don&#39;t believe in you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.599" end="00:43:09.430" style="s2">killing every American that I see right</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.820" end="00:43:11.650" style="s2">well neither you nor I elected to put</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.430" end="00:43:13.630" style="s2">those people there nor can we elect to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.650" end="00:43:16.510" style="s2">get them out of there so we&#39;ll leave the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.630" end="00:43:17.800" style="s2">judgment upon that sort of side and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.510" end="00:43:18.940" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s kind of actually one</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.800" end="00:43:20.530" style="s2">thing that would come up is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.940" end="00:43:22.540" style="s2">you know they would they would say you</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.530" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">know you know where are we put in here</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.540" end="00:43:26.650" style="s2">and I said look I I was ordered here to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:28.390" style="s2">write you know what was your biggest</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.650" end="00:43:33.430" style="s2">takeaway you think from that your</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.390" end="00:43:35.080" style="s2">experience there Wow is that because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.430" end="00:43:37.300" style="s2">know jack not everybody who&#39;s listening</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.080" end="00:43:38.020" style="s2">to this podcast was an interrogator at</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.300" end="00:43:42.460" style="s2">Guantanamo Bay</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.020" end="00:43:46.180" style="s2">well I wouldn&#39;t specific irrigator but</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.460" end="00:43:47.109" style="s2">interrogator operations because I was in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.180" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">I would say certain things</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.109" end="00:43:56.020" style="s2">what&#39;s blue and and I want to be precise</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:44:00.570" style="s2">to so just that and this is gonna sound</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.020" end="00:44:00.570" style="s2">weird but I&#39;ll put it this way that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.740" end="00:44:08.410" style="s2">there are people who may be vastly</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.560" end="00:44:11.670" style="s2">different from us who may have even</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.410" end="00:44:14.119" style="s2">joined organizations to called al-qaeda</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">but you can still find common</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.119" end="00:44:19.670" style="s2">nowadays with them and that they join</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:22.279" style="s2">these organizations not because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.670" end="00:44:24.019" style="s2">crazy you know in this which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.279" end="00:44:25.160" style="s2">this this knee-jerk response to say well</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.019" end="00:44:26.779" style="s2">that you&#39;re crazy you&#39;re crazy to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.160" end="00:44:29.269" style="s2">something like that and see it is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.779" end="00:44:31.609" style="s2">obviously if I play you know planes into</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.269" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">buildings but to understand that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.609" end="00:44:37.460" style="s2">have a logical rational in their you</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">know their own sense they have a self</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.460" end="00:44:42.650" style="s2">rationalization that brings them to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:44.630" style="s2">these things and only really by</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.650" end="00:44:47.539" style="s2">understanding what that is and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.630" end="00:44:49.759" style="s2">know it&#39;s an ideology by understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.539" end="00:44:51.829" style="s2">what they believe through what they say</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.759" end="00:44:55.039" style="s2">is the only way you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.829" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">understand what the situation is so for</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.039" end="00:44:59.329" style="s2">people who just kind of paint with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:01.849" style="s2">broad brush and say everyone in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.329" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">part of the world is bad that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.849" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">right or to say that you know everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:08.089" style="s2">in that part of the world is just crazy</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:10.009" style="s2">and backwards and everything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.089" end="00:45:12.259" style="s2">right either but to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.009" end="00:45:15.109" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s more going on under the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.259" end="00:45:17.150" style="s2">surface than just adherence to you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.109" end="00:45:20.059" style="s2">whatever Osama bin Laden says and try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.150" end="00:45:22.910" style="s2">understand the ideology that&#39;s driving</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.059" end="00:45:25.130" style="s2">and motivating this I found that very</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.910" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">very interesting and so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.130" end="00:45:29.150" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing where I say to people</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:31.009" style="s2">look when I in in my public career now</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.150" end="00:45:33.049" style="s2">when I&#39;m talking about radical Islam I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.009" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">have a perspective on it that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.049" end="00:45:36.739" style="s2">hands-on right more so than that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:38.779" style="s2">probably it you know the college</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.739" end="00:45:40.069" style="s2">professor or someone who&#39;s never spent</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.779" end="00:45:42.140" style="s2">time listening to the things of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.069" end="00:45:44.029" style="s2">people say right that&#39;s fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.140" end="00:45:45.589" style="s2">it made me actually just think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.029" end="00:45:46.970" style="s2">gonna talk about this in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.589" end="00:45:50.019" style="s2">William Lynn&#39;s book fourth-generation</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.970" end="00:45:55.220" style="s2">warfare and then thinking about how like</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.019" end="00:45:57.849" style="s2">you said radical feminism radical Islam</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.220" end="00:46:01.039" style="s2">in my mind I was thinking radicalized</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.849" end="00:46:02.690" style="s2">Islam and I was yeah and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.039" end="00:46:05.150" style="s2">about for generation more fair William</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.690" end="00:46:07.900" style="s2">Lind and the stories sort of fables I</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.150" end="00:46:11.390" style="s2">guess that he told in there about how</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.900" end="00:46:14.180" style="s2">American behavior can actually create</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.390" end="00:46:18.380" style="s2">these exact people that are living now</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.180" end="00:46:20.089" style="s2">in Guantanamo Bay his book is fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.380" end="00:46:23.269" style="s2">I highly recommend it to everyone and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.089" end="00:46:25.720" style="s2">fact I modeled my book for tea warfare</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.269" end="00:46:27.890" style="s2">off of his book for generation warfare</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.720" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">but the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.890" end="00:46:31.579" style="s2">understanding that he puts forward in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:33.799" style="s2">that book is is it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.579" end="00:46:35.480" style="s2">comprehensive but it&#39;s a great starter</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.799" end="00:46:37.549" style="s2">for anybody who wants to get into that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.480" end="00:46:39.349" style="s2">space right I and I highly recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.549" end="00:46:40.940" style="s2">for anybody for everybody fourth</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.349" end="00:46:43.299" style="s2">generation warfare William Lind on</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.940" end="00:46:45.349" style="s2">Casilla distill the house I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.299" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">because it&#39;s just a great way to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.349" end="00:46:49.519" style="s2">understand it&#39;s sort of a foundational</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:53.240" style="s2">piece and trying to understand the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.519" end="00:46:54.859" style="s2">today and how the future of warfare is</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.240" end="00:46:58.010" style="s2">going to look and how we&#39;re perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.859" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">already in the middle of a more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.010" end="00:47:03.890" style="s2">sort of 4G sort of civil civil conflict</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:05.269" style="s2">here I wish I could guess it&#39;s I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.890" end="00:47:06.799" style="s2">could give that book to every leader in</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.269" end="00:47:08.660" style="s2">the United States right every political</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.799" end="00:47:11.299" style="s2">and military leader and say please just</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.660" end="00:47:16.099" style="s2">just die and don&#39;t just repeat what this</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.299" end="00:47:18.650" style="s2">says understand what this book means and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.099" end="00:47:20.210" style="s2">understand how there are things that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.650" end="00:47:22.579" style="s2">may think are good ideas and there may</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.210" end="00:47:24.529" style="s2">be policy or foreign policy outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.579" end="00:47:26.269" style="s2">that you&#39;re looking to achieve but</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.529" end="00:47:28.430" style="s2">you&#39;re going about it in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.269" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">actually detrimental to your interest in</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.430" end="00:47:32.690" style="s2">to the interest of others because of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:33.799" style="s2">what essentially fourth generation where</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.690" end="00:47:36.319" style="s2">I talked about as you say why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.799" end="00:47:39.470" style="s2">someone just say it yeah the way you go</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.319" end="00:47:41.960" style="s2">about things is almost more important</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.470" end="00:47:43.940" style="s2">than your intention very well said</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.960" end="00:47:46.099" style="s2">very succinct so in the book Lind goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.940" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">through an example of operation David</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.099" end="00:47:49.369" style="s2">and operation Goliath and what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">different outcomes would be an operation</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.369" end="00:47:54.200" style="s2">Goliath is like bringing the most amount</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">of weaponry to bear you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.200" end="00:47:57.740" style="s2">certain point and like flattening cities</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:00.410" style="s2">and rolling through with tanks and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.740" end="00:48:02.930" style="s2">thing and then the soldiers are you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.410" end="00:48:04.910" style="s2">marching with you know be helmets and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.930" end="00:48:07.250" style="s2">armor and just showing everybody how</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.910" end="00:48:10.460" style="s2">tough they are and real like world war</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.250" end="00:48:12.589" style="s2">two style just just marching across the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.460" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">country you know and conquering as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.589" end="00:48:16.849" style="s2">go right even like World War one even</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:19.210" style="s2">right right right and then and then and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.849" end="00:48:22.519" style="s2">then the the operation David is about</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.519" end="00:48:26.390" style="s2">of into the culture and society that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.529" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">you&#39;re occupying and like how to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.390" end="00:48:30.980" style="s2">your goals without dropping you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:32.329" style="s2">Moab&#39;s on villages just because you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.980" end="00:48:33.829" style="s2">didn&#39;t like what happened there like one</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.329" end="00:48:36.470" style="s2">of the examples that I really liked was</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.829" end="00:48:38.299" style="s2">a instead of having like a huge base</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.470" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">outside the city like have have your</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.299" end="00:48:41.540" style="s2">guys like actually quartered within the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:43.430" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.540" end="00:48:45.800" style="s2">then B was like instead of instead of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.430" end="00:48:47.960" style="s2">dropping you know bonds to kill a guy</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.800" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">you know higher like the local gangster</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.960" end="00:48:53.390" style="s2">guys to do a hit job or something</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:55.370" style="s2">exactly like very small sort of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.390" end="00:48:57.080" style="s2">whole perspective change in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.370" end="00:48:58.790" style="s2">lining up on either side of the field</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.080" end="00:49:00.470" style="s2">and shooting at each other or destroying</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.790" end="00:49:02.870" style="s2">everything in your path or like</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.470" end="00:49:06.170" style="s2">realizing that you need the people there</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.870" end="00:49:08.390" style="s2">to support you and you need also to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.170" end="00:49:10.910" style="s2">something left to govern at the end when</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.390" end="00:49:13.240" style="s2">you&#39;re done and and their whole reason I</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.910" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">brought this up just now is because</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.240" end="00:49:18.740" style="s2">operating as Goliath you do definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:21.590" style="s2">radicalize people and create more</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.740" end="00:49:23.320" style="s2">enemies whereas if you go about it in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.590" end="00:49:27.320" style="s2">much more empathetic and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.320" end="00:49:29.780" style="s2">socially aware way even it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.320" end="00:49:32.060" style="s2">surgical and you then have you create</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.780" end="00:49:34.070" style="s2">less enemies and less conflict and one</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.060" end="00:49:36.170" style="s2">of the things that that I actually talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.070" end="00:49:38.390" style="s2">about more in 4d warfare which in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.170" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">book I take the David versus Goliath</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.390" end="00:49:42.290" style="s2">paradigm and that&#39;s that&#39;s the way he</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:43.940" style="s2">puts it as so eloquently said whoever</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.290" end="00:49:45.530" style="s2">read the story of David versus Goliath</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.940" end="00:49:48.380" style="s2">and identified with Goliath</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.530" end="00:49:50.570" style="s2">did you always identify with David who</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.380" end="00:49:51.800" style="s2">you are hoped for and oh I have to win</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.570" end="00:49:52.310" style="s2">right or hope for you right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.800" end="00:49:54.710" style="s2">make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.310" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s literally and what you say</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.710" end="00:49:58.700" style="s2">that the United States is perceived as</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:01.400" style="s2">Damon or Goliath around the world Chuck</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.700" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">and this is something this is key this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.400" end="00:50:04.430" style="s2">is so key to everybody listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:06.920" style="s2">in the United States that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.430" end="00:50:10.490" style="s2">already understand this that the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.920" end="00:50:13.820" style="s2">the world for right or wrong right they</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.490" end="00:50:16.820" style="s2">perceive us as Goliath pretty much every</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.820" end="00:50:20.930" style="s2">country on the planet even our allies</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.820" end="00:50:23.630" style="s2">view us as Goliath and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.930" end="00:50:25.670" style="s2">necessarily wrong if you look at terms</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.630" end="00:50:28.910" style="s2">of the way that we make demands of other</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.670" end="00:50:30.680" style="s2">countries the way that we influence</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.910" end="00:50:32.870" style="s2">other countries countries kill everybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.680" end="00:50:34.520" style="s2">right disrupt entire regions right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.870" end="00:50:36.440" style="s2">right and the way that we oh we could we</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.520" end="00:50:38.540" style="s2">call it intervention under for</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.440" end="00:50:40.820" style="s2">democratic purposes a nation-building</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.540" end="00:50:43.820" style="s2">but to the rest of the world we just</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.820" end="00:50:45.590" style="s2">sort of look like we&#39;ve invaded because</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.820" end="00:50:47.560" style="s2">we felt like it and we want something</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.590" end="00:50:50.090" style="s2">and we&#39;re just shooting up people and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.560" end="00:50:51.890" style="s2">that&#39;s created a perception of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.090" end="00:50:53.480" style="s2">United States where you know under</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.890" end="00:50:54.590" style="s2">george w bush we had that perception and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.480" end="00:50:55.340" style="s2">the people thought obama would change</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.590" end="00:50:57.290" style="s2">things and then he</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.340" end="00:50:58.850" style="s2">sort of continued doing it the invasion</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.290" end="00:51:01.070" style="s2">of Libya which really doesn&#39;t get talked</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.850" end="00:51:03.800" style="s2">about very much this changes perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.070" end="00:51:06.710" style="s2">around the world and of the United</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.800" end="00:51:07.910" style="s2">States and you know as we said now not</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.710" end="00:51:09.560" style="s2">to get into current events but people</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.910" end="00:51:11.380" style="s2">are talking about Iran you know doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.560" end="00:51:13.610" style="s2">doing something there and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.380" end="00:51:17.230" style="s2">understanding that and this is a big</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.610" end="00:51:20.390" style="s2">problem not a problem but a big</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.230" end="00:51:23.300" style="s2">situation or a big circumstance that has</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.390" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">changed since warfare has gone on from</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.300" end="00:51:28.220" style="s2">world war two to now is the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:31.010" style="s2">first the mainstream media and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.220" end="00:51:33.740" style="s2">second of social media so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.010" end="00:51:37.250" style="s2">understanding that something that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.740" end="00:51:39.260" style="s2">in a small capacity right you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.250" end="00:51:41.540" style="s2">Abu Ghraib earlier I mentioned the photo</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.260" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">of Guantanamo even if it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.540" end="00:51:46.250" style="s2">that only happens for one second if if</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:47.690" style="s2">that moment in time is captured and it</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.250" end="00:51:49.670" style="s2">makes someone look like David and make</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.690" end="00:51:53.270" style="s2">someone look like Goliath that can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.670" end="00:51:56.090" style="s2">amplified around the world faster than</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.270" end="00:51:59.630" style="s2">any response can be met or any and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.090" end="00:52:02.030" style="s2">no explanation is ever going to be power</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.630" end="00:52:03.620" style="s2">more powerful than that image no</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.030" end="00:52:05.930" style="s2">explanation is ever going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.620" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">powerful than that first narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.930" end="00:52:12.470" style="s2">comes out right do you do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:16.040" style="s2">social media and you know 2019 media in</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.470" end="00:52:18.980" style="s2">general will make it harder to bang war</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.040" end="00:52:25.600" style="s2">drums and and rally people behind the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.980" end="00:52:29.090" style="s2">cause of war it will change it because</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.600" end="00:52:31.220" style="s2">there are ways that you can manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.090" end="00:52:33.590" style="s2">social media that governments could</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.220" end="00:52:35.030" style="s2">manipulate social media that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.590" end="00:52:36.500" style="s2">think of a franz ferdinand ferdinand</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.030" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">situation right so Franz Ferdinand was</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.500" end="00:52:42.650" style="s2">the was the Archduke he was assassinated</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:45.620" style="s2">when it but then the lead-up to World</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.650" end="00:52:47.720" style="s2">War one and so that that kicked off this</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.620" end="00:52:49.340" style="s2">this series of you know secret alliances</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.720" end="00:52:51.950" style="s2">that led to World War One happening so</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.340" end="00:52:53.720" style="s2">you got one instant that sparks an</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.950" end="00:52:57.140" style="s2">entire world war and wasn&#39;t really the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.720" end="00:52:59.180" style="s2">whole world but with social media you</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.140" end="00:53:01.550" style="s2">could still have that same effect you</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.180" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">could easily have that same effect with</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.550" end="00:53:06.140" style="s2">a 30-second video depending on what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:07.830" style="s2">video was and who it was and what was</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.140" end="00:53:09.930" style="s2">happening I think absolutely something</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.830" end="00:53:11.610" style="s2">like that could happen hmm you know you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.930" end="00:53:14.100" style="s2">don&#39;t think that now that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.610" end="00:53:16.200" style="s2">million competing narratives in people</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.100" end="00:53:18.270" style="s2">like yourself and some of our friends</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.200" end="00:53:22.290" style="s2">that have very large platforms that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.270" end="00:53:25.230" style="s2">drive narrative that contrasted to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.290" end="00:53:27.540" style="s2">world war two or even the Iraq war the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.230" end="00:53:29.070" style="s2">first Iraq war when the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.540" end="00:53:31.140" style="s2">in the Washington Post basically had a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.070" end="00:53:34.170" style="s2">virtual monopoly on the information flow</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.140" end="00:53:35.850" style="s2">they were able and I don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.170" end="00:53:38.520" style="s2">was a conspiracy but it probably was</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.850" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">they were able to work with the fake</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.520" end="00:53:41.910" style="s2">intelligence information and tell us all</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:44.370" style="s2">that there was weapons of mass</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.910" end="00:53:46.530" style="s2">destruction and everybody you know who</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.370" end="00:53:48.510" style="s2">had half a brain was like al-qaeda</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.530" end="00:53:50.760" style="s2">nuclear bombs met weapons of mass</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.510" end="00:53:52.620" style="s2">destruction Saddam Hussein holy of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.760" end="00:53:54.690" style="s2">course we need to go to war like they</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.620" end="00:53:55.230" style="s2">made perfect sense but there that was I</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.690" end="00:53:57.840" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.230" end="00:53:59.430" style="s2">what was that Leon 2002 or three or</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.840" end="00:54:01.460" style="s2">something that was two into three it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.430" end="00:54:03.930" style="s2">a second one yeah so it is like wow</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.460" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">today there would be a million competing</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.930" end="00:54:06.750" style="s2">narratives so there will be a million</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:08.070" style="s2">independent journalists there made</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.750" end="00:54:10.260" style="s2">million people spreading different</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.070" end="00:54:12.360" style="s2">stories so do you it takes a lot I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.260" end="00:54:14.280" style="s2">to rally a country into sending off you</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.360" end="00:54:17.130" style="s2">know 500,000 people so it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.280" end="00:54:19.800" style="s2">interesting about it is now with social</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.130" end="00:54:24.660" style="s2">media you have the democratization of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.800" end="00:54:27.390" style="s2">information and the ability for one</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.660" end="00:54:29.400" style="s2">controlling narrative to be out there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.390" end="00:54:31.020" style="s2">is lost there&#39;s there&#39;s so there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.400" end="00:54:34.020" style="s2">your right in that sense there there are</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.210" end="00:56:10.650" style="s2">definitely the most anti-war coalition</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.410" end="00:56:13.260" style="s2">that the right has ever had in in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.650" end="00:56:15.120" style="s2">American politics and sort of it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.260" end="00:56:18.030" style="s2">of anti intervention and you saw this</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.120" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">again and again over the course of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.030" end="00:56:23.340" style="s2">early Trump administration that there</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:25.290" style="s2">would be times where neoconservatives</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.340" end="00:56:27.480" style="s2">would be pushing for war the media would</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.290" end="00:56:29.190" style="s2">be really beating those drums of</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.190" end="00:56:32.310" style="s2">to do something we have to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.110" end="00:56:35.880" style="s2">and you would see a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.310" end="00:56:37.800" style="s2">Mokka community saying is is war the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.880" end="00:56:40.010" style="s2">only way we can respond to this do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.800" end="00:56:42.600" style="s2">really know what&#39;s going on should we</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.010" end="00:56:44.880" style="s2">immediately jump the gun to launching</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.600" end="00:56:46.440" style="s2">missiles or invading when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.880" end="00:56:48.270" style="s2">nebulous situation and we&#39;re not sure</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.270" end="00:56:52.650" style="s2">specific but right you you you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.730" end="00:56:55.020" style="s2">this sort of narrative play out again</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.650" end="00:56:57.570" style="s2">and again where a lot of folks in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.020" end="00:57:00.980" style="s2">manga community turn things around and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.570" end="00:57:02.550" style="s2">they say and this is this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.980" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">quintessentially the reason that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.550" end="00:57:08.310" style="s2">Donald Trump was able to stand out so</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:10.020" style="s2">much in the election and really win over</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.310" end="00:57:11.370" style="s2">even in the general election right not</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.020" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">so much the primary which people talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.370" end="00:57:14.820" style="s2">about the general why did he win the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:18.600" style="s2">general is because he said I want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.820" end="00:57:22.590" style="s2">care about the American people and their</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.600" end="00:57:24.630" style="s2">interests first and that was something</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.590" end="00:57:27.420" style="s2">that nobody had said in politics for</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.630" end="00:57:29.310" style="s2">twenty thirty years of saying hey what</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.420" end="00:57:30.390" style="s2">about our inner cities what about our</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.310" end="00:57:32.819" style="s2">infrastructure what</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.390" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">about our the wages of American workers</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.819" end="00:57:35.400" style="s2">what about these jobs that have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.079" end="00:57:37.380" style="s2">shipped overseas and a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.400" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">things we didn&#39;t used to think of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.380" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">as political issues right we used to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:42.660" style="s2">think of political issues as you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:43.980" style="s2">you know should we own guns how many</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.660" end="00:57:44.519" style="s2">good should we owe and how should we get</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.980" end="00:57:46.380" style="s2">guns</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.519" end="00:57:48.029" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with abortion and should</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.380" end="00:57:51.750" style="s2">we have that and you know these are the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.029" end="00:57:54.359" style="s2">traditional areas of sort of left versus</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.750" end="00:57:57.089" style="s2">right debate but when Trump came out he</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.359" end="00:57:58.740" style="s2">started talking about America versus the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.089" end="00:58:00.690" style="s2">rest of the world type of things and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.740" end="00:58:02.819" style="s2">that was an entirely different framework</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.690" end="00:58:05.130" style="s2">than anyone had ever entered into before</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.819" end="00:58:08.069" style="s2">and I think that because of that there</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.130" end="00:58:10.410" style="s2">were people who it fit very much in line</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.069" end="00:58:12.299" style="s2">with a lot of the anti-war crowd who</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.410" end="00:58:14.760" style="s2">also would make that same argument to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.299" end="00:58:17.309" style="s2">say this this war this intervention this</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.760" end="00:58:20.430" style="s2">nation-building situation doesn&#39;t serve</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.309" end="00:58:23.000" style="s2">the needs of America right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.430" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">necessarily just like a strident</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.000" end="00:58:28.170" style="s2">anti-war position it&#39;s more like all</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:29.789" style="s2">these recent wars have been really</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.170" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2">stupid and dumb and lots of people died</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.789" end="00:58:33.420" style="s2">and what good has it done for America</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:34.859" style="s2">why aren&#39;t we just a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.420" end="00:58:36.900" style="s2">careful with our decision making my I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.859" end="00:58:38.369" style="s2">was just moving forward right one of my</p>

<p begin="00:58:51.269" end="00:58:56.609" style="s2">you know we got to talk on the phone and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.309" end="00:58:58.230" style="s2">I said you know what what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.609" end="00:58:59.910" style="s2">the goal was over there what were you</p>

<p begin="00:58:59.910" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">not to talk operationally but he said</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.059" end="00:59:07.319" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re just kind of delaying the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:09.089" style="s2">inevitable I mean that never will pull</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.319" end="00:59:12.210" style="s2">out right the inevitable pull out and</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.089" end="00:59:13.799" style="s2">the eventual takeover by by the local</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.210" end="00:59:17.190" style="s2">populace those take back over the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.799" end="00:59:18.329" style="s2">country and the idea that America is</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.190" end="00:59:20.910" style="s2">going to be able to fundamentally change</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.329" end="00:59:23.190" style="s2">a country that has existed in the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.910" end="00:59:26.220" style="s2">state for thousands of years it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:09.800" end="01:10:14.750" style="s2">you how do you do that so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.580" end="01:10:17.390" style="s2">fast-forwarding here a little bit but</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.750" end="01:10:19.880" style="s2">it&#39;s and just to say in a quick way it</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.390" end="01:10:21.560" style="s2">was really going to the rallies on both</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.880" end="01:10:22.880" style="s2">sides both Trump rallies and Hillary</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.560" end="01:10:26.270" style="s2">rallies and then people forget about</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.880" end="01:10:27.850" style="s2">this but they tried to downplay the idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.270" end="01:10:30.470" style="s2">that Trump had a lot of support and</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.850" end="01:10:33.110" style="s2">going to those rallies and showing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.470" end="01:10:34.610" style="s2">sheer size the crowd size of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.110" end="01:10:36.230" style="s2">pictures that I was seeing and posting</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.610" end="01:10:37.580" style="s2">those people were saying I&#39;m not getting</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.230" end="01:10:39.980" style="s2">this anywhere else I&#39;m not getting this</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.580" end="01:10:41.480" style="s2">because people would go right but they</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.980" end="01:10:42.530" style="s2">weren&#39;t posting on social media they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.480" end="01:10:44.510" style="s2">just you know share a picture with their</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.530" end="01:10:45.800" style="s2">friends or sharing on Facebook which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.510" end="01:10:46.699" style="s2">more of like a closed sandbox</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.800" end="01:10:47.929" style="s2">environment whereas</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.699" end="01:10:51.560" style="s2">there&#39;s an open sandbox that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.929" end="01:10:53.480" style="s2">videocam term right and so basically</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.560" end="01:10:55.340" style="s2">what it means is on Twitter you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.480" end="01:10:57.500" style="s2">share something to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.340" end="01:10:59.510" style="s2">whereas on Facebook you&#39;re only sharing</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.500" end="01:11:01.969" style="s2">something essentially to people that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.510" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">were friends and family with and have</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.969" end="01:11:06.710" style="s2">closed network so it&#39;s a closed network</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:10.280" style="s2">and so by doing that on Twitter really</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.710" end="01:11:12.320" style="s2">got picked up I eventually got a you</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.280" end="01:11:13.790" style="s2">know sort of asked by Bill Mitchell if I</p>

<p begin="01:31:43.230" end="01:31:48.749" style="s2">then so everything that you then do goes</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.289" end="01:31:52.050" style="s2">back to reinforce your brand and to at</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.749" end="01:31:54.420" style="s2">least set your initial brand to be what</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.050" end="01:31:56.400" style="s2">you want it to be so don&#39;t give people</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.420" end="01:32:01.170" style="s2">the opportunity to brand you as</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.400" end="01:32:02.969" style="s2">something else and if you do that and</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.170" end="01:32:04.829" style="s2">you maintain everything around that</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.969" end="01:32:06.659" style="s2">initial brand and here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.829" end="01:32:09.480" style="s2">right the problem is is that we live in</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.659" end="01:32:13.050" style="s2">this world where you could be somebody</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.480" end="01:32:14.760" style="s2">who&#39;s who is on a a private account who</p>

<p begin="01:32:21.749" end="01:32:25.710" style="s2">you a little slander you they won&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.280" end="01:32:28.949" style="s2">ask you a question right and even if</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.710" end="01:32:30.719" style="s2">you&#39;re a private person and they&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.949" end="01:32:33.719" style="s2">everything you say in the worst possible</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.719" end="01:32:35.429" style="s2">light and they will will twist</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.719" end="01:32:38.219" style="s2">things that you have said and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.429" end="01:32:41.099" style="s2">sort of the Media Matters formula</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.219" end="01:32:42.090" style="s2">twisting something progress yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.099" end="01:32:44.579" style="s2">I think progress is found about John</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.090" end="01:32:47.670" style="s2">Podesta so you know take something that</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.579" end="01:32:51.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve said and twist it into this</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.670" end="01:32:53.760" style="s2">funhouse version of the opposite of what</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.300" end="01:32:54.580" style="s2">you intended to say right I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.760" end="01:32:57.790" style="s2">personal</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.580" end="01:32:58.510" style="s2">with that for sure also experiences</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.790" end="01:33:01.480" style="s2">around what you&#39;re saying around</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.510" end="01:33:04.030" style="s2">branding and now I think a year or two</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.480" end="01:33:06.640" style="s2">ago me would gag at the notion of social</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.030" end="01:33:08.140" style="s2">media branding but you know I think that</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.640" end="01:33:11.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve all kind of can accept to these</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.140" end="01:33:13.450" style="s2">days that social media you can take an</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.980" end="01:33:16.120" style="s2">approach on social media that requires</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.450" end="01:33:18.850" style="s2">branding and requires brand management</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.120" end="01:33:20.770" style="s2">and brand care and and forethought and</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.850" end="01:33:23.500" style="s2">for someone like me and someone like you</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.770" end="01:33:27.880" style="s2">who&#39;s social media experiences were</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.500" end="01:33:30.130" style="s2">deeply personal initially and not around</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.880" end="01:33:31.630" style="s2">a certain brand idea or brand concept</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.130" end="01:33:33.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of risk involved in that</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.630" end="01:33:34.540" style="s2">man and it&#39;s like which is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.220" end="01:33:36.460" style="s2">interesting to think is because</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.540" end="01:33:38.410" style="s2">initially right when I did my Game of</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.460" end="01:33:40.420" style="s2">Thrones thing that was a brand that was</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.410" end="01:33:42.550" style="s2">all thought out prior to because I was I</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.420" end="01:33:44.680" style="s2">was doing a character right right and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.550" end="01:33:47.920" style="s2">that there was a specific voice there</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.680" end="01:33:49.540" style="s2">was angry yeah he&#39;s always screaming</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.920" end="01:33:53.860" style="s2">he&#39;s always loud that&#39;s that&#39;s me doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.540" end="01:33:55.900" style="s2">a characterize versus me just joking</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.860" end="01:33:59.260" style="s2">around on the internet as myself right</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.900" end="01:34:01.360" style="s2">and so understanding that you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.260" end="01:34:03.370" style="s2">have to come to social media in that</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.360" end="01:34:04.900" style="s2">same vein and even if you&#39;re someone who</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.370" end="01:34:06.250" style="s2">thinks well I don&#39;t I don&#39;t roleplay I</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.900" end="01:34:08.020" style="s2">don&#39;t do characters I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.250" end="01:34:11.230" style="s2">professional well guess what like your</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.020" end="01:34:13.180" style="s2">version of your whatever your personal</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.230" end="01:34:14.800" style="s2">perspective of what a professional is</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.180" end="01:34:16.270" style="s2">and what a professional should do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.800" end="01:34:18.520" style="s2">still a character because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.270" end="01:34:19.780" style="s2">just quote-unquote being yourself right</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.520" end="01:34:22.320" style="s2">so that you&#39;re still playing a character</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.780" end="01:34:24.310" style="s2">still playing a role and this is why</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.320" end="01:34:26.440" style="s2">personally I think that my Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.310" end="01:34:28.150" style="s2">account at least now has been able to</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.440" end="01:34:31.660" style="s2">take off so much and be so successful is</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.150" end="01:34:33.700" style="s2">because I&#39;ve learned to become a self</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.660" end="01:34:36.550" style="s2">actualized character in the sense where</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.700" end="01:34:38.950" style="s2">I am myself yes I can connect</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.550" end="01:34:42.010" style="s2">emotionally with my fans I try to engage</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.950" end="01:34:45.210" style="s2">be as accessible and engaged as much as</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.010" end="01:34:48.100" style="s2">I can you know with that many followers</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.210" end="01:34:49.570" style="s2">but you know I do a lot of AMAs I do a</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.100" end="01:34:51.490" style="s2">lot of hey guys what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.570" end="01:34:55.060" style="s2">this I don&#39;t know what my take is what</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.490" end="01:34:59.230" style="s2">your you know what&#39;s your opinion and in</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.060" end="01:35:02.350" style="s2">doing so you can be yourself more than</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.230" end="01:35:06.790" style="s2">than this character but at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.350" end="01:35:08.790" style="s2">you want to maintain who you are and let</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.790" end="01:35:10.920" style="s2">that shine forward</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.790" end="01:35:12.540" style="s2">before the other side can kind of take</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.920" end="01:35:15.240" style="s2">things out of context and decide who you</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.540" end="01:35:17.340" style="s2">are you know I remember early Mike&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:35:31.290" end="01:35:36.540" style="s2">it&#39;s performance art right and it took</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.530" end="01:35:38.550" style="s2">me a couple of years to even realize</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.540" end="01:35:40.620" style="s2">what that really meant I mean it really</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.550" end="01:35:42.180" style="s2">is performance art and now it&#39;s it&#39;s if</p>

<p begin="01:35:47.040" end="01:35:50.850" style="s2">know that my I know that my ex-wife</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.690" end="01:35:52.290" style="s2">exclave and some of her friends they</p>

<p begin="01:35:52.290" end="01:35:56.430" style="s2">so like I&#39;ll get messages later like oh</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.110" end="01:36:00.240" style="s2">I can&#39;t believe you said that on Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.430" end="01:36:03.660" style="s2">I&#39;m like it&#39;s all true it&#39;s all real but</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.240" end="01:36:05.730" style="s2">it&#39;s also not exactly it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.660" end="01:36:08.250" style="s2">real life - it&#39;s like I would never just</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.730" end="01:36:10.320" style="s2">sit in front of a room full of people</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.250" end="01:36:12.540" style="s2">and just sort of act and talk that way</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.320" end="01:36:15.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a very specific thing that happens</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.540" end="01:36:17.820" style="s2">on social media right and and I I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.420" end="01:36:20.250" style="s2">it&#39;s unfair to try to reduce someone to</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.820" end="01:36:21.600" style="s2">it tweet yeah write that I&#39;m gonna read</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.250" end="01:36:22.950" style="s2">it though you tweeted this thing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.600" end="01:36:24.540" style="s2">gonna reduce you to it to eat that</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.950" end="01:36:26.430" style="s2">that&#39;s not a person that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.540" end="01:36:29.910" style="s2">tweet that&#39;s a thought Twitter is the</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.430" end="01:36:31.950" style="s2">it&#39;d you know in many ways right and</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.910" end="01:36:33.990" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a part of someone it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.950" end="01:36:37.500" style="s2">part of thought but it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.990" end="01:36:39.150" style="s2">totality and it can&#39;t be and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.500" end="01:36:42.600" style="s2">at some point we&#39;ll you know as a</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.150" end="01:36:45.870" style="s2">society understand that our social media</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.600" end="01:36:47.250" style="s2">is an extension of us but it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.870" end="01:36:51.270" style="s2">of us right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.250" end="01:36:53.130" style="s2">I I am as authentic as I can be on</p>

<p begin="01:36:54.780" end="01:37:01.110" style="s2">account and to my storytelling it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.660" end="01:37:03.570" style="s2">100% authentic and true but it&#39;s curated</p>
