<p begin="00:00:09.080" end="00:00:13.009" style="s2">see where it goes from there I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.639" end="00:00:16.900" style="s2">this is the first time we have a Sweeney</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:28.310" style="s2">debate it was quite predictable</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.470" end="00:00:31.550" style="s2">Savo won my handsomely but in a graceful</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.310" end="00:00:33.890" style="s2">way and I hope to begin with they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.550" end="00:00:36.379" style="s2">both more interested in each other after</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.890" end="00:00:38.539" style="s2">the debate and I certainly think that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.379" end="00:00:40.339" style="s2">lot of salvation fans out there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.539" end="00:00:42.079" style="s2">going out buying Jordan Peterson looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.339" end="00:00:43.249" style="s2">and there&#39;s certainly a lot of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.079" end="00:00:45.140" style="s2">Peterson fans out there who buy</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.249" end="00:00:47.149" style="s2">obviously she&#39;s books so it&#39;s really we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.140" end="00:00:49.699" style="s2">get more dialogue between the two I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.149" end="00:00:51.800" style="s2">solid won in a way because he I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.699" end="00:00:53.210" style="s2">you know quite early in the debate he</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.800" end="00:00:55.010" style="s2">just said we&#39;ll come on this is not like</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.210" end="00:00:56.269" style="s2">a fighting ring this is just like two</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:05.990" style="s2">of the yet because and I think that was</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.369" end="00:01:14.869" style="s2">have stood there and said you know the</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.219" end="00:01:22.759" style="s2">there you know there was a certain greed</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">involved with the whole event that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.759" end="00:01:27.229" style="s2">just exposed to that you know it was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:28.579" style="s2">bit of a red carpet event in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.229" end="00:01:30.829" style="s2">which i don&#39;t think that was their</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.579" end="00:01:32.329" style="s2">intention but it is it wasn&#39;t red carpet</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.829" end="00:01:33.890" style="s2">event it was in their expense it to go</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.890" end="00:01:37.850" style="s2">that event so yeah that was problematic</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.780" end="00:01:39.680" style="s2">but probably didn&#39;t so we didn&#39;t do stat</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.980" end="00:03:38.840" style="s2">then started doing Marxism essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.110" end="00:03:42.050" style="s2">and that was a huge reaction against</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.470" end="00:14:23.970" style="s2">example the nation of Israel mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.660" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good story that we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.970" end="00:14:27.900" style="s2">retell today and say we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:30.060" style="s2">again we can do better and it can last</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.900" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">longer this time because we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.060" end="00:14:33.630" style="s2">acknowledge this the person does never</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">had okay so you&#39;re saying wish it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.630" end="00:14:40.200" style="s2">ideal wise they got it correct mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:43.110" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying you&#39;re saying we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.200" end="00:14:44.820" style="s2">to kind of in a sense integrate all</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.110" end="00:14:48.090" style="s2">these things integrate the nation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.820" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">then yeah towards this global sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.090" end="00:14:51.510" style="s2">what you call a global Empire maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:58.650" style="s2">want to clarify the concept of global</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.510" end="00:15:00.540" style="s2">Empire because it&#39;s called it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.650" end="00:15:02.310" style="s2">the Internet right mm-hmm maybe he said</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.540" end="00:15:03.930" style="s2">absolutely everything on our planet</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.310" end="00:15:07.020" style="s2">today&#39;s being connected with everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.930" end="00:15:12.360" style="s2">else so that planet becomes one huge</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.020" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">computer okay so the your argument is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.360" end="00:15:16.500" style="s2">not that this is going to destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.980" end="00:15:18.300" style="s2">nation-state that but we that it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.500" end="00:15:21.350" style="s2">to be above the nation-state like we</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.300" end="00:15:24.510" style="s2">have a kind of hierarchy empire nation</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.350" end="00:15:26.310" style="s2">okay China Russia sort of experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.510" end="00:15:29.310" style="s2">with somehow being outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.310" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">internet towel fail dictatorships of the</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.959" end="00:15:44.190" style="s2">you can disconnect the world from the</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.190" end="00:15:55.139" style="s2">internet now controls the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.230" end="00:15:57.810" style="s2">mm-hm it&#39;s one huge phenomenon because</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.139" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">it means that all computers and all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.810" end="00:16:02.370" style="s2">smartphones in all the sensors and all</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.500" style="s2">the data centers on the planet are</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.370" end="00:16:07.139" style="s2">connected with each other and as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.500" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">you got a cloud of data in Word it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.139" end="00:16:10.680" style="s2">the interest of that cloud to unify</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:12.569" style="s2">itself with other clouds of data so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.680" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">eventually all these clouds data become</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.569" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">one huge cloud now if all data of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">world goes into one cloud and both</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.940" end="00:16:22.410" style="s2">Google and the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:24.060" style="s2">are attempting to do exactly that at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.410" end="00:16:25.769" style="s2">moment as soon as you got one good</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.060" end="00:16:27.389" style="s2">scholar that is all the data of</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.389" end="00:16:33.870" style="s2">everything that happens around us mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.660" end="00:16:35.339" style="s2">then that computer will be capable of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.870" end="00:16:37.410" style="s2">predicting the future on a level that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.339" end="00:16:40.829" style="s2">none of us none of the rest of us can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.410" end="00:16:44.910" style="s2">and that includes predicting the future</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.829" end="00:16:46.410" style="s2">of each one of us and it&#39;s groupings so</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.910" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">you can move all the way down to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.410" end="00:16:50.940" style="s2">tribal level the Dunbar&#39;s number which</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:52.920" style="s2">is a hundred and fifty seven hundred</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.940" end="00:16:54.630" style="s2">fifty seven is the number where people</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:16:56.069" style="s2">that we could connect with that most of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.630" end="00:16:58.019" style="s2">us could connect with we have have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.069" end="00:16:59.010" style="s2">idea who they are if you know them you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.019" end="00:17:01.319" style="s2">know their names you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.010" end="00:17:03.269" style="s2">backgrounds about 150 separate people I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.319" end="00:17:04.860" style="s2">mean it&#39;s the entire tribe including all</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.269" end="00:17:06.600" style="s2">elderly and children can be much wonder</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.860" end="00:17:08.850" style="s2">50 people and it&#39;s the ultimate size</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.600" end="00:17:11.850" style="s2">first we a program to handle that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.850" end="00:17:13.589" style="s2">that&#39;s easy we call that intra tribal</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.850" end="00:17:15.329" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to teach a human being to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.589" end="00:17:18.630" style="s2">the intertribal that&#39;s easy to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.329" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">anywhere beyond that takes effort it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.630" end="00:17:23.850" style="s2">takes narrative takes priestly work so</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:26.579" style="s2">the move from tribe to clan was the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.850" end="00:17:30.750" style="s2">first step the next step was climbed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.579" end="00:17:33.960" style="s2">nation yeah it&#39;s taken us the last 3,000</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.750" end="00:17:35.790" style="s2">years to move from clan to nation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.960" end="00:17:39.150" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the story of the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.790" end="00:17:42.150" style="s2">again or what we&#39;re going about</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.150" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">nationality so so nationalism so the</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:12.650" style="s2">end of nationalism because the last</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.390" end="00:20:16.940" style="s2">moves forward through Spinoza and we end</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.580" end="00:20:18.530" style="s2">up with the last today the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.770" end="00:20:32.900" style="s2">from reality and the big mistake that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.679" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">was done in the West was the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.900" end="00:20:38.750" style="s2">dualism and it starts with Plato and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.190" style="s2">of course Judaism has the problem Islam</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.750" end="00:20:42.919" style="s2">and Christianity certainly have this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.190" end="00:20:46.580" style="s2">problem we dualism right so the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.919" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t dualist the world is modest so to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.580" end="00:20:52.040" style="s2">begin with it&#39;s a lie you know spirit</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:54.110" style="s2">and body are not separate spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.040" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">body need each other they can be no</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.110" end="00:20:57.620" style="s2">spirit without body into certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:00.260" style="s2">that could be no body without spirit as</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.620" end="00:21:03.080" style="s2">well so spirit about our United the one</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.260" end="00:21:04.340" style="s2">thing being human is meaning having a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.080" end="00:21:05.960" style="s2">spirit and body they&#39;re just two</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.340" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">different attributes of the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.960" end="00:21:11.150" style="s2">substance which is getting human so the</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.150" end="00:21:15.470" style="s2">radically modest and and in there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.580" end="00:21:16.730" style="s2">one universe period and everything in</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.470" end="00:21:19.070" style="s2">this universe is interconnected with</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.720" end="00:21:29.419" style="s2">so that means the question is where did</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.600" end="00:21:31.250" style="s2">dualism come from and I know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.419" end="00:21:32.990" style="s2">conviction that dualism wasn&#39;t just an</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.250" end="00:21:37.040" style="s2">idea that somebody that planar come up</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.990" end="00:21:40.490" style="s2">with I think dualism has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.040" end="00:21:43.400" style="s2">child&#39;s fascination with a sexual ritual</p>
