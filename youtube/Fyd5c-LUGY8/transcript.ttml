<p begin="00:02:23.569" end="00:02:27.650" style="s2">it I don&#39;t even know what it was five</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.920" end="00:02:28.910" style="s2">simple enemas but watching that I really</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.650" end="00:02:31.459" style="s2">wanted to reach out to him so I did it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.910" end="00:02:33.890" style="s2">on video with our own five-step plan for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.459" end="00:02:35.900" style="s2">the World Cafe and I tweeted it at him</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.890" end="00:02:38.030" style="s2">and he just right before I went live</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.900" end="00:02:39.769" style="s2">liked it it&#39;s like me I liked it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.030" end="00:02:42.409" style="s2">I like my stuff that I want to go I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.769" end="00:02:44.870" style="s2">the algorithm to pick up and he liked it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.409" end="00:02:46.790" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay that I&#39;m now gushing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.870" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2">little bit yeah it is it&#39;s okay to gush</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:52.549" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to be exactly what you are in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:54.709" style="s2">the moment and that is what the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.549" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">Cafe is and even if that&#39;s all that ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.709" end="00:03:00.129" style="s2">comes from it that like JP Sears liked</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:03:02.660" style="s2">the the tweet that I I treated out him</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.129" end="00:03:04.250" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t even matter like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.660" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">it&#39;s fun to reach out to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.250" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">who inspire me and ask them to come on</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:12.980" style="s2">and it puts me in a space of being like</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:14.959" style="s2">we&#39;re on the same level cuz everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.980" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">on the same level everyone gets to just</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:19.010" style="s2">show up and be who they are and yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:22.069" style="s2">reaching out to the influencers who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.010" end="00:03:23.569" style="s2">the viewers who have the the platform so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.069" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">they can bring a bit of that and spread</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.569" end="00:03:30.260" style="s2">a bit of that like in socialism in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">idea that we have to like take from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.260" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">top and give to everybody else which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:40.010" style="s2">agree with there&#39;s a need for like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:41.720" style="s2">costs you something right if you tack</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.010" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">somebody you&#39;re taking from them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.720" end="00:03:44.389" style="s2">give you into everyone else Robin Hood</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:47.419" style="s2">was stealing from the rich and give you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.389" end="00:03:49.489" style="s2">into the poor and yet influence is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.419" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2">something that it doesn&#39;t actually cost</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.489" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">you to share and so coming on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">bringing with you a small piece of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:04:00.230" style="s2">100,000 or a million subscribers and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:02.180" style="s2">are also sharing it because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.230" end="00:04:03.410" style="s2">just having influencers on that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.180" end="00:04:05.299" style="s2">the point the point is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.410" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">platform where everybody is seen and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.299" end="00:04:09.079" style="s2">everybody is heard on the idea cafe and</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.490" end="00:08:26.150" style="s2">present on screen when someone was</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.900" end="00:08:27.229" style="s2">talking and there is good and bad with</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.150" end="00:08:28.789" style="s2">that because you can see people getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.229" end="00:08:33.050" style="s2">distracted but you can also see people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.789" end="00:08:34.490" style="s2">emotions and in the other one it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.050" end="00:08:36.979" style="s2">like I was popping people up and down</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.490" end="00:08:38.539" style="s2">which also like one person leaves with</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.979" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a little distracting on</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.539" end="00:08:42.349" style="s2">the screen but also like I got to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:44.210" style="s2">people&#39;s emotions cuz I can see them at</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.349" end="00:08:47.330" style="s2">the bottom of my screen slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.210" end="00:08:50.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like washed out like it&#39;s a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.330" end="00:08:50.350" style="s2">knows a filter on it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.470" end="00:08:53.860" style="s2">but I could see they&#39;re reacting to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.420" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">other people are saying I was reacting</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.860" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">to what other people say but no one can</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:08:58.090" style="s2">see that and I&#39;m like that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.170" end="00:09:00.190" style="s2">part of conversation I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.090" end="00:09:02.140" style="s2">do both of those things to have somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.190" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">on screen like when we have the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">cafe platform it will be and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:07.900" style="s2">clearly just me talking about idea I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:14.050" style="s2">guess I know my house like why are we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.900" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">doing technology plans change so</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.050" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">creating a like when the platform&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:21.520" style="s2">there the ideas we do show up when we</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">are present with each other and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.520" end="00:09:24.010" style="s2">listening to each other and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:25.630" style="s2">streamed lives if you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.010" end="00:09:26.890" style="s2">distracted it&#39;s you don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.630" end="00:09:28.810" style="s2">about other people seeing that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.890" end="00:09:30.040" style="s2">have to worry about like to try and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.810" end="00:09:31.450" style="s2">be distracted because we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.040" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">listen to each other we&#39;re trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.450" end="00:09:34.420" style="s2">present and hear each other&#39;s stories to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:36.730" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.420" end="00:09:38.440" style="s2">to listen for our commonality and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.730" end="00:09:40.210" style="s2">having that little conversation at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.440" end="00:09:43.480" style="s2">end the last for like five minutes like</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.210" end="00:09:47.020" style="s2">how do we bring this all together I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.480" end="00:09:49.150" style="s2">see so much power in what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.020" end="00:09:53.710" style="s2">together with a platform like that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.150" end="00:09:56.170" style="s2">so that is what the idea cafe YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.710" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">channel is is gonna showcase yes it goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.170" end="00:10:01.570" style="s2">live at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesdays and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:03.960" style="s2">want that to continue and then I want it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.570" end="00:10:08.020" style="s2">to spread to other time periods but as</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.960" end="00:10:09.670" style="s2">like my original vision two weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.020" end="00:10:11.890" style="s2">was that we&#39;d have one question for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.670" end="00:10:13.270" style="s2">week and people would would post like in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.890" end="00:10:14.740" style="s2">the comments section and although I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.270" end="00:10:17.530" style="s2">really want people to do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.740" end="00:10:19.810" style="s2">people to who can&#39;t be part of the few</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.530" end="00:10:21.820" style="s2">people on screen to share theirs if they</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.810" end="00:10:23.500" style="s2">want to share it like we will I will I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.820" end="00:10:26.530" style="s2">will watch it especially when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.500" end="00:10:28.060" style="s2">you know thousands of them I can&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.530" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">for that to be the problem I can&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.060" end="00:10:32.020" style="s2">for it to be thousands of people but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:34.540" style="s2">will watch people&#39;s videos commenting on</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.020" end="00:10:41.620" style="s2">that week&#39;s question and sharing from</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.540" end="00:10:43.210" style="s2">their heart and but I can see so much of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.620" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">what we can do with a platform room</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.210" end="00:10:47.050" style="s2">where you show up as you are have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:49.690" style="s2">conversation around a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.050" end="00:10:51.190" style="s2">question and we the platform give you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.690" end="00:10:53.320" style="s2">people to talk to about that question</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.190" end="00:10:55.089" style="s2">and we generate those questions together</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.320" end="00:10:56.350" style="s2">so not everyone generates a question</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.089" end="00:10:57.730" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s gonna dissipate the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.350" end="00:11:00.430" style="s2">energy or not to be able to have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.730" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">cafe because it&#39;ll only be maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.430" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">other person to talk to about it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:04.310" style="s2">maybe that is something we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.550" end="00:11:06.830" style="s2">down the path of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.310" end="00:11:08.690" style="s2">but not until we have more people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.830" end="00:11:10.310" style="s2">we want like one question a day so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.690" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">as the people are brought in to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.310" end="00:11:14.120" style="s2">conversation with that question it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:15.740" style="s2">common thread that like we all have</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.120" end="00:11:19.220" style="s2">something to share on this question and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.740" end="00:11:21.290" style="s2">then as people join in we can branch out</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.220" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">into areas of interest of like here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.290" end="00:11:24.830" style="s2">question on climate change here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">question on spirituality here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.830" end="00:11:29.210" style="s2">question on fashion I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:30.980" style="s2">anything people want it&#39;s gonna tie them</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.210" end="00:11:32.540" style="s2">together it&#39;s about sitting down seeing</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.980" end="00:11:34.910" style="s2">somebody&#39;s humanity and seeing that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.540" end="00:11:37.310" style="s2">have more in common than we have that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.910" end="00:11:39.950" style="s2">divides us and the things that divide us</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.310" end="00:11:41.930" style="s2">the things that lead to our diversity</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.950" end="00:11:44.150" style="s2">you&#39;re actually our most powerful I can</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">could be on a rating scale and we could</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.220" end="00:13:40.089" style="s2">help each other or show up on time our</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:41.799" style="s2">ability to follow through on a</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.499" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">not gonna be as likely to sell to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.419" end="00:14:00.069" style="s2">and that is you know I think that helps</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:02.289" style="s2">us build trust but it&#39;s not about one</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.069" end="00:14:04.059" style="s2">person creating that it&#39;s about getting</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.059" end="00:14:11.079" style="s2">and and creating a system like that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.229" end="00:14:13.029" style="s2">we want to have to interact with each</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.079" end="00:14:14.679" style="s2">other and then as people want to come on</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.029" end="00:14:17.019" style="s2">board it&#39;s voluntary right like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.679" end="00:14:19.299" style="s2">go out and rate everybody else although</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.019" end="00:14:21.099" style="s2">some of the technology absolutely go out</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.299" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">and rate other people like the imbd for</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.099" end="00:14:25.089" style="s2">politicians of course this urine in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:27.009" style="s2">public I you&#39;re a politician we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.089" end="00:14:29.079" style="s2">be rating you the CEOs and how like</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.009" end="00:14:30.819" style="s2">corrupt and horrible or good they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.079" end="00:14:32.139" style="s2">what their corporation is actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.819" end="00:14:33.759" style="s2">and how do we have those metrics</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.139" end="00:14:35.679" style="s2">those are things we&#39;re gonna go out and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.759" end="00:14:36.879" style="s2">actually grade people on but currently</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.679" end="00:14:39.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the other way around they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.879" end="00:14:41.559" style="s2">of like keeping data on us and deciding</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.100" end="00:14:44.409" style="s2">how to sell us more stuff if we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.559" end="00:14:46.989" style="s2">harness the information on them we flip</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.409" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">the script like it&#39;s the masses have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.989" end="00:14:51.970" style="s2">power and we&#39;ve already seen that in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:54.009" style="s2">lot of ways like Yelp going in and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.970" end="00:14:55.389" style="s2">giving somebody a low rating especially</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.009" end="00:15:01.989" style="s2">when they&#39;re a mom-and-pop type business</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.389" end="00:15:03.819" style="s2">can be devastating for them and a tech</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.989" end="00:15:06.369" style="s2">in Russia we are testing small chips</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.819" end="00:15:08.350" style="s2">implanted in people that&#39;s scary but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.369" end="00:15:10.059" style="s2">mean if people are willing in China they</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.350" end="00:15:11.769" style="s2">have face recognition which gives people</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.059" end="00:15:14.819" style="s2">low credit scores for bad behavior yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.769" end="00:15:16.989" style="s2">yeah exactly and so I think there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.819" end="00:15:19.149" style="s2">scary that can happen with</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.989" end="00:15:20.349" style="s2">technology and right now that that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.149" end="00:15:24.249" style="s2">we want to focus on creating a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.349" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">technology cooperative is technology has</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.249" end="00:15:29.470" style="s2">so much power a little too much power</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.209" style="s2">that we daren&#39;t wheel in that are not</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.470" end="00:15:33.160" style="s2">wielded in any way in the hands of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.209" end="00:15:36.850" style="s2">people we&#39;re having it wielded against</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.160" end="00:15:39.189" style="s2">us and so they like the top what four or</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.850" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">five companies on the stock exchange or</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.189" end="00:15:43.660" style="s2">technology companies are like Amazon</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.179" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">stuff that we really need there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.439" end="00:16:02.019" style="s2">reason they&#39;ve like won the market but</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:03.819" style="s2">we can create something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.019" end="00:16:05.800" style="s2">have the downside and does have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.819" end="00:16:07.480" style="s2">positive side we can create something</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.800" end="00:16:09.550" style="s2">that we trust where we&#39;re not giving our</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.480" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">data to corporations so they can sell us</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.550" end="00:16:13.420" style="s2">more that&#39;s destroying our planet</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:15.610" style="s2">we can create it so that our data is</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.610" end="00:16:19.329" style="s2">create a world that works for like uh</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:29.529" style="s2">and act on it and so creating the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.679" end="00:16:32.670" style="s2">technology cooperative is what we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.529" end="00:16:35.649" style="s2">to do like technology is is both very</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.860" end="00:17:50.890" style="s2">have if we have the ability if we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.820" end="00:17:52.600" style="s2">the ability to have a small and I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.890" end="00:17:54.460" style="s2">the you next a second if we have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.600" end="00:17:56.110" style="s2">capacity to have a conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.460" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">group of people it doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.110" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">7.5 billion it&#39;s maybe never gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:02.860" style="s2">7.5 billion but to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:05.429" style="s2">with a thousand people to ask them for</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.860" end="00:18:08.860" style="s2">their ideas and to upvote and downvote</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.429" end="00:18:12.010" style="s2">what we want in an app what we want in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.860" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">in a platform and then create a beta</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.010" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">create something that works for most</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:16.630" style="s2">people and have the way for people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">constantly say what would make it better</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.630" end="00:18:21.220" style="s2">and participate in making it better</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:23.770" style="s2">without like Henze like you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.220" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">it this way or i&#39;m not using it it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.770" end="00:18:27.370" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the same power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:29.860" style="s2">that we have when we create it together</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.370" end="00:18:32.559" style="s2">that we have with Google or with Walmart</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.860" end="00:18:34.330" style="s2">or with anyone that is selling us</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:37.150" style="s2">something and we have that distrust of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.330" end="00:18:39.340" style="s2">them which arises from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.150" end="00:18:42.910" style="s2">Bitcoin blockchain and permutation for</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.340" end="00:18:46.990" style="s2">currency requires a physical wallet like</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.910" end="00:18:48.669" style="s2">yeah I mean that is I don&#39;t think any of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.990" end="00:18:50.200" style="s2">the crypto currencies that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.669" end="00:18:51.580" style="s2">out there right now I don&#39;t think are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.200" end="00:18:53.650" style="s2">going to be the solution for the futures</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.580" end="00:18:57.400" style="s2">cryptocurrency needs or currency needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.650" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">if we have a currency needs I think we</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.400" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">will decide on what the like what gives</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:05.530" style="s2">money I know this isn&#39;t really what</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:08.260" style="s2">you&#39;re asking but what gives money value</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.530" end="00:19:09.790" style="s2">is us agreeing that it&#39;s worth something</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.260" end="00:19:12.340" style="s2">right us agreeing to use it in</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.790" end="00:19:17.559" style="s2">transactions to sell for Bitcoin to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.340" end="00:19:18.700" style="s2">accept Bitcoin so Bitcoin has values one</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.559" end="00:19:20.110" style="s2">of the first ones on the market but now</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.700" end="00:19:20.890" style="s2">there&#39;s thousands of them which one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.110" end="00:19:23.140" style="s2">going to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.890" end="00:19:26.110" style="s2">none of them we will create we&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.140" end="00:19:27.880" style="s2">at what is positive and negative about</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.110" end="00:19:29.890" style="s2">each one of them what we need to have in</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.880" end="00:19:31.720" style="s2">one and then we will create it and when</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.890" end="00:19:34.419" style="s2">we create it it&#39;ll be something we will</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.720" end="00:19:36.490" style="s2">use internally so it already has value</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.419" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">and then as we want to use it externally</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.490" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">yes it&#39;ll have an exchange rate for</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:41.799" style="s2">something on the you know outside but</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:43.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the only reason Bitcoin really</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.799" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">hustle you anyways cuz it&#39;s exchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.510" end="00:19:47.530" style="s2">for real money on the outside then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:49.540" style="s2">have the issue of like speculation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.530" end="00:19:54.070" style="s2">you know exchange yet so so creating one</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.540" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">ourselves is going to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.070" end="00:19:57.610" style="s2">ends up happening I don&#39;t think it&#39;s day</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.950" style="s2">one like it&#39;s not what we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.610" end="00:20:03.100" style="s2">are the things we&#39;re currently using so</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.950" end="00:20:06.039" style="s2">that Google can&#39;t strangle our traffic</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.100" end="00:20:07.239" style="s2">so that Facebook can&#39;t decide to stop us</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.039" end="00:20:08.590" style="s2">from having our own social media</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.239" end="00:20:10.419" style="s2">platform that actually actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.590" end="00:20:14.139" style="s2">disseminates proper information and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.419" end="00:20:16.690" style="s2">action access and those things you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.139" end="00:20:18.129" style="s2">create overnight if I recreated Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.690" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">even if I have the capability and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.129" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">money to do that no one&#39;s coming on</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.519" style="s2">board so the idea is to create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:27.279" style="s2">together that that we already have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.519" end="00:20:28.809" style="s2">threshold and users who want so if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.279" end="00:20:31.239" style="s2">had a million people come together be</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.809" end="00:20:33.279" style="s2">like yes we want a cooperatively owns</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.239" end="00:20:36.009" style="s2">don&#39;t hold and don&#39;t contain my data</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.279" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">social media platform and then a million</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.009" end="00:20:38.739" style="s2">people are enough to start it because a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:42.519" style="s2">million people can interact with one</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.739" end="00:20:44.139" style="s2">another in a very real way we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.519" end="00:20:45.519" style="s2">your friends and family to come on board</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.139" end="00:20:47.080" style="s2">for you to want to use our social media</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.519" end="00:20:50.230" style="s2">platform there&#39;s already enough people</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.080" end="00:20:52.119" style="s2">here to use it and so that&#39;s how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.230" end="00:20:53.529" style="s2">creating products is we&#39;re not creating</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.119" end="00:20:55.389" style="s2">them and then hoping people come on</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.529" end="00:20:56.889" style="s2">board and marketing them we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.389" end="00:20:59.259" style="s2">marketing beforehand and being like how</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.889" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">do we create this how do we fund it</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.259" end="00:21:03.519" style="s2">together and so the first one because</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:05.590" style="s2">it&#39;s the one I&#39;m capable of doing within</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.519" end="00:21:07.659" style="s2">my limitation is the idea of cafe which</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.590" end="00:21:09.609" style="s2">is my other YouTube channel it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.659" end="00:21:11.859" style="s2">YouTube channel right now where people</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.609" end="00:21:13.149" style="s2">can come and have a conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.859" end="00:21:15.149" style="s2">a meaningful question because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.149" end="00:21:17.049" style="s2">gonna be the first platform we create</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.149" end="00:21:20.230" style="s2">but what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.049" end="00:21:22.269" style="s2">is going to change based on how it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.230" end="00:21:23.830" style="s2">happens on YouTube like what do we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.269" end="00:21:25.509" style="s2">in a conversation what works what</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.830" end="00:21:27.639" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and we&#39;ll be using existing</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.509" end="00:21:30.039" style="s2">technology like our first beta isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.639" end="00:21:32.169" style="s2">gonna have streaming video that we own</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.039" end="00:21:34.600" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be using zoom it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.169" end="00:21:37.149" style="s2">connecting people in a in a back room</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.600" end="00:21:39.119" style="s2">that back room maybe the back ends it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.149" end="00:21:41.259" style="s2">gonna say hey when are you available</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.119" end="00:21:43.090" style="s2">this is where you show up to your to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.259" end="00:21:44.830" style="s2">your video conversation based on your</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.090" end="00:21:46.899" style="s2">availability and what you want in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.830" end="00:21:49.509" style="s2">conversation and then generate those</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.899" end="00:21:51.249" style="s2">conversations as we figure out the kinks</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.509" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">and what works and what doesn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.249" end="00:21:55.239" style="s2">creating our social media platform that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:57.970" style="s2">will be probably a million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.239" end="00:22:00.549" style="s2">platform that but the first one will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.970" end="00:22:02.350" style="s2">a few thousand dollars to create and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.549" end="00:22:03.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have a few thousand dollars nor do</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.350" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">I want to create something that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.460" end="00:22:07.570" style="s2">be slightly broken and then break the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:09.460" style="s2">whole thing I want to bring people on</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.570" end="00:22:10.490" style="s2">board so right now it is just a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.460" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">channel we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.490" end="00:22:15.890" style="s2">doing that using stream yard - and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:17.330" style="s2">YouTube to stream live on 11 a.m. on</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:18.650" style="s2">Wednesdays I&#39;m bringing people on to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.330" end="00:22:20.540" style="s2">answer a meaningful question and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.650" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">showcase what a conversation looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.540" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">at the same time I&#39;m reaching out to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:29.030" style="s2">YouTube so I was talking about for</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.690" end="00:22:30.350" style="s2">anyone going on YouTube people with more</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.080" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">people so like you have a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.490" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">subscribers by l.b I don&#39;t need doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">matter because I&#39;m not asking how many</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:53.150" style="s2">underneath so if we get celebrities on</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.990" end="00:22:55.070" style="s2">then they bring with them their fans and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.150" end="00:22:56.420" style="s2">with them their subscribers and those</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.460" end="00:23:11.660" style="s2">so as the subscription and interest</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.910" end="00:24:18.260" style="s2">you have 10,000 people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.620" end="00:24:19.340" style="s2">climate change and we generated an</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.260" end="00:24:20.330" style="s2">amazing so someone comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.340" end="00:24:21.480" style="s2">something and we&#39;re like oh my god</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.250" end="00:24:30.149" style="s2">like don&#39;t you say 10,000 I guess we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.110" end="00:24:32.190" style="s2">only have $10,000 then but everyone puts</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.190" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">create this with and then you also have</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.500" end="00:24:47.880" style="s2">like okay well 10,000 people have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.970" end="00:24:50.820" style="s2">conversation maybe maybe a thousand have</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.880" end="00:24:54.120" style="s2">the the harvesting of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.820" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">to see how that what was commonality and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.120" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what sparks the idea and then a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:58.740" style="s2">hundred of those people want to commit</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:00.450" style="s2">themselves to work you know on it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.740" end="00:25:03.000" style="s2">ten people end up actually working</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.450" end="00:25:05.820" style="s2">full-time on it and then one person is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.000" end="00:25:07.409" style="s2">like super key so we&#39;re like filtering</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.820" end="00:25:08.580" style="s2">down we&#39;re not saying that yes when</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">create the actual space that is not</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.790" end="00:27:43.290" style="s2">and I&#39;m like look if you can&#39;t make it</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.290" end="00:27:47.880" style="s2">accessible it has to be intellectually</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.880" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">it has to be not from day one it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.130" end="00:27:54.420" style="s2">necessarily mean that like everything we</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:57.090" style="s2">do has to be able to be understood by</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.420" end="00:27:59.070" style="s2">90% of the people but to if you if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.090" end="00:28:00.990" style="s2">concept can&#39;t be understood eventually</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.070" end="00:28:02.790" style="s2">in an easy way by 90% of people it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.990" end="00:28:04.380" style="s2">gonna be adopted and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.790" end="00:28:06.780" style="s2">think cryptocurrency is an issue I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.380" end="00:28:09.420" style="s2">having these thoughts yesterday of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.780" end="00:28:10.890" style="s2">I feel I understand cryptocurrency and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.420" end="00:28:13.320" style="s2">now if I understand blockchain enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.890" end="00:28:15.060" style="s2">but I don&#39;t there&#39;s when people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.320" end="00:28:17.190" style="s2">talking I&#39;m like what are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.060" end="00:28:18.780" style="s2">about like this is it&#39;s like oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.190" end="00:28:20.430" style="s2">know like they&#39;re like making their</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.780" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">language much more complex than it needs</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.430" end="00:28:25.140" style="s2">to be and the other space I have felt</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:27.420" style="s2">that in where I felt grossly inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.140" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">and having a conversation was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.420" end="00:28:32.610" style="s2">in university about physics and I could</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:34.530" style="s2">have an intellectual conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.610" end="00:28:36.300" style="s2">about biology and I could even possibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.530" end="00:28:37.740" style="s2">do it about chemistry even if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.300" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">quite because I understood the bonds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.740" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">chemistry if I couldn&#39;t have as deep of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:43.500" style="s2">a conversation but physics was like</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:45.780" style="s2">vibrating strings and Schrodinger&#39;s cat</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.500" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">and other dimensions I&#39;m like Tessa</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.780" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">racks folding up like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:52.610" style="s2">it&#39;s not mine but but physics and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:53.929" style="s2">is what I was playing with yesterday I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.610" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">like physics is different because you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.790" end="00:34:14.850" style="s2">everybody needs that for their idea and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.619" end="00:34:16.080" style="s2">then there&#39;s like the legal structure</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.850" end="00:34:17.399" style="s2">and the insurance structure and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.080" end="00:34:19.109" style="s2">everything that has to prop that up</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.399" end="00:34:20.310" style="s2">because we don&#39;t trust one another and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.109" end="00:34:22.379" style="s2">you might be lying and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.310" end="00:34:27.210" style="s2">be like when we create something</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.379" end="00:34:29.820" style="s2">together it&#39;s in that like we are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.210" end="00:34:31.409" style="s2">be less likely to sue zero chance of sue</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.820" end="00:34:34.830" style="s2">me no of course not but we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.409" end="00:34:36.750" style="s2">less likely to sue because we have like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.830" end="00:34:38.730" style="s2">it&#39;s how you like to explain the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.750" end="00:34:42.210" style="s2">difference if you go to a restaurant and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.730" end="00:34:43.950" style="s2">you get food poisoning you sue if you go</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.210" end="00:34:45.540" style="s2">to a friend&#39;s house and you get food</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.950" end="00:34:46.919" style="s2">poisoning you&#39;re probably gonna tell</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.540" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">your friend and you might never eat</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:50.490" style="s2">there again but you&#39;re not gonna sue</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.290" style="s2">them and so when we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.490" end="00:34:55.350" style="s2">something if we&#39;re creating a product if</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.290" end="00:34:57.270" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a service and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.350" end="00:34:59.340" style="s2">looking at the risk we&#39;re saying what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.270" end="00:35:01.740" style="s2">the risk like how do we put food safety</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.340" end="00:35:03.660" style="s2">into place for for food but then</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.740" end="00:35:04.680" style="s2">something goes wrong we&#39;re looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.660" end="00:35:07.170" style="s2">and figure out how to make it not wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.680" end="00:35:09.570" style="s2">go wrong again but we&#39;re not suing like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.170" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">that&#39;s part of our like terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.570" end="00:35:13.320" style="s2">agreement right that like you didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.490" end="00:35:14.280" style="s2">it either you know I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.320" end="00:35:15.480" style="s2">know like there&#39;s these little things</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.280" end="00:35:17.130" style="s2">called buckyballs they were little</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.480" end="00:35:19.170" style="s2">magnetic balls actually have some that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.130" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">aren&#39;t called mochi balls but they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.170" end="00:35:24.390" style="s2">all over the place like ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">maybe and and they&#39;re little magnets</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.390" end="00:35:28.050" style="s2">that people can swallow and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:29.700" style="s2">you swallow two magnets it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.050" end="00:35:31.170" style="s2">destructive because they meet each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.700" end="00:35:34.080" style="s2">in your body and they can kill you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.170" end="00:35:35.310" style="s2">like a slow-moving bullet how nobody</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.080" end="00:35:36.900" style="s2">thought of that before it was on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.310" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">market and kids started swallowing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.900" end="00:35:40.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like nobody at that table thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:41.640" style="s2">of that nobody had a kid that happen to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.410" end="00:35:43.740" style="s2">have a magnet that they swallowed and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.640" end="00:35:45.420" style="s2">had to go to emergency room okay if</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.740" end="00:35:46.590" style="s2">there been 10,000 of us putting that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.420" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">would have thought about that and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.590" end="00:35:49.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t we would have been like do not</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:52.050" style="s2">sell this to people who have children</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.940" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">and then if you bought it when you had</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.050" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">children it would be this is my friend</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:02.280" style="s2">from periscope so you have the kiddo and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:03.660" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just sue sue your own friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.280" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">he would be interesting to see over us</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.660" end="00:36:08.040" style="s2">and it does happen it definitely happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:12.540" style="s2">but it does it&#39;s like you have to what</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.040" end="00:36:15.690" style="s2">what level of violence or what is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.540" end="00:36:16.860" style="s2">word that you sue people for um neglect</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.690" end="00:36:18.930" style="s2">I can&#39;t think of the word that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.860" end="00:36:20.250" style="s2">somewhere in the back of my head you</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.930" end="00:36:21.960" style="s2">would have to have a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.250" end="00:36:23.340" style="s2">negligence I think is the word that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.960" end="00:36:26.070" style="s2">would sue for than you would for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.340" end="00:36:27.690" style="s2">corporation or a for-profit company like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.070" end="00:36:29.820" style="s2">this food poisoning they&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.690" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">to food poison you but if you like went</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:34.890" style="s2">that steak story I left it out for 48</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.970" end="00:36:37.830" style="s2">hours yeah you might sue them then cuz</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.890" end="00:36:40.530" style="s2">you&#39;re like you did what your ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.830" end="00:36:42.030" style="s2">human why would you feed me that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.530" end="00:36:43.560" style="s2">like a higher level of negligence and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.030" end="00:36:44.940" style="s2">we&#39;re building it into the system where</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.560" end="00:36:46.380" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be less likely to sue</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.940" end="00:36:49.290" style="s2">because we all should have seen the risk</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.380" end="00:36:51.360" style="s2">so we all chose to kind of take that</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.290" end="00:36:53.130" style="s2">risk on and we&#39;re looking to make it</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.360" end="00:36:55.440" style="s2">better like if you are now permanently</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.130" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">disabled because of something we did if</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.440" end="00:36:58.080" style="s2">there&#39;s enough of us we can figure out</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.680" style="s2">the legal system and when we make your</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.680" end="00:37:25.860" style="s2">which would help everybody live their</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.860" end="00:37:30.210" style="s2">happen to have blindness but also people</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.390" end="00:37:32.580" style="s2">who whatever tech that technology is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.210" end="00:37:34.920" style="s2">like when voice-to-text a voice helps a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.580" end="00:37:37.470" style="s2">lot of people but isn&#39;t only that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.920" end="00:37:38.790" style="s2">making any sense an interesting concept</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.470" end="00:37:40.200" style="s2">dimension because it&#39;s not accessible</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.790" end="00:37:41.670" style="s2">you need a lawyer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.200" end="00:37:44.040" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things we will be we</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.670" end="00:37:48.990" style="s2">will be recreating to the best of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.040" end="00:37:50.790" style="s2">ability like there was a good life good</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.990" end="00:37:52.290" style="s2">good remember it&#39;s called if The Good</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.790" end="00:37:55.740" style="s2">Wife had to spin off about the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.290" end="00:37:57.480" style="s2">and one of the episodes was a asset that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.740" end="00:37:59.130" style="s2">one of the lawyers brothers created who</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.480" end="00:38:02.070" style="s2">had been in jail and he created this</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.130" end="00:38:03.780" style="s2">this app that helped people not sue the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.070" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">jail but put in a complaint against the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.780" end="00:38:07.530" style="s2">jail which there is a process to do but</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:09.030" style="s2">it&#39;s so arduous that you need a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.530" end="00:38:10.619" style="s2">and so that you need to contact a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.030" end="00:38:11.970" style="s2">which is really hard to do from jail and</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.619" end="00:38:14.430" style="s2">costly and all these things so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.970" end="00:38:17.099" style="s2">basically made an app that ran through</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.430" end="00:38:18.359" style="s2">it it helped you and the other lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.099" end="00:38:19.619" style="s2">basically bought it and put it on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.359" end="00:38:21.660" style="s2">shelf cuz they were like you mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.619" end="00:38:23.700" style="s2">putting us out of this like this not to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.660" end="00:38:26.849" style="s2">happen we want our hundreds of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.700" end="00:38:28.619" style="s2">per hour but we wouldn&#39;t like we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.849" end="00:38:30.510" style="s2">co-create that like that is an actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.619" end="00:38:33.270" style="s2">idea we can co-create to help people in</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.510" end="00:38:34.650" style="s2">prison get access to legal advice and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.270" end="00:38:36.690" style="s2">there are things out there that are like</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.650" end="00:38:38.130" style="s2">that and we&#39;re putting in place like</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.690" end="00:38:41.490" style="s2">this is not a lawyer this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.130" end="00:38:43.829" style="s2">lawyer legally this is not law advice</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.490" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s the best you can access for</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.829" end="00:38:47.910" style="s2">free it&#39;s the best you can access for</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">very low cost and so it&#39;s better than no</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.910" end="00:38:52.170" style="s2">lawyer it&#39;s maybe not as good as having</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">a lawyer but if that&#39;s spelled out and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.170" end="00:38:57.180" style="s2">in in an actual Terms of agreement way</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">that like is accessible and not least 15</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.180" end="00:39:01.910" style="s2">pages of legalese documents but like hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:04.470" style="s2">we&#39;re not a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.910" end="00:39:06.089" style="s2">don&#39;t pretend we&#39;re a lawyer this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.470" end="00:39:08.310" style="s2">like don&#39;t come back at us later and be</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.089" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">like you gave us bad advice this is our</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.310" end="00:39:12.599" style="s2">co-created law advice so it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.099" style="s2">we have to give it&#39;s gonna be less than</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.599" end="00:39:17.460" style="s2">a doctor we can do that with therapy</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.099" end="00:39:19.859" style="s2">like so many people have mental health</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.460" end="00:39:23.490" style="s2">in crisis and there&#39;s no therapy to go</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.740" end="00:40:03.970" style="s2">was like something innocuous and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.930" end="00:40:06.609" style="s2">ended up that this guy brought forward</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.970" end="00:40:07.720" style="s2">his his stepson committed suicide a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.609" end="00:40:08.829" style="s2">months ago I didn&#39;t know that ring</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.720" end="00:40:10.869" style="s2">community together and I didn&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.180" end="00:40:19.180" style="s2">crisis and being like I just want</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.859" end="00:40:20.589" style="s2">someone to talk to and I called the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.180" end="00:40:22.660" style="s2">suicide line because it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.589" end="00:40:24.190" style="s2">people available and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.660" end="00:40:26.170" style="s2">available I was like what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.190" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not available this is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.170" end="00:40:30.130" style="s2">I know there&#39;s people out there if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:31.569" style="s2">post it on my Facebook to my friends</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.130" end="00:40:34.150" style="s2">somebody would contact me but I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.150" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">this moment it&#39;s too vulnerable how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.579" end="00:40:39.609" style="s2">we co-create that with people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:42.039" style="s2">tried to commit suicide but people</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.609" end="00:40:44.500" style="s2">who&#39;ve lost people to suicide to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.039" end="00:40:46.420" style="s2">what do you need in that moment and how</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.500" end="00:40:48.010" style="s2">do we create it and then we already have</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.420" end="00:40:50.010" style="s2">the people who are interested in both</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.010" end="00:40:52.180" style="s2">being the people people reach out to in</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.010" end="00:40:53.559" style="s2">co-creating a space of like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.180" end="00:40:55.329" style="s2">now you know you&#39;re not gonna go and get</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.559" end="00:40:56.650" style="s2">institutionalized because that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.329" end="00:40:57.970" style="s2">why people don&#39;t reach out like I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.650" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">a horrific experience being</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.970" end="00:41:02.769" style="s2">institutionalized and if I go forward</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:04.299" style="s2">I&#39;d rather be dead I&#39;d rather be dead</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.769" end="00:41:05.769" style="s2">than go through that again and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.299" end="00:41:07.299" style="s2">don&#39;t have anywhere to go and they feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.769" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">so alone and they feel it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.299" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">well what can we do for each other it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:14.470" style="s2">won&#39;t be perfect we&#39;ll still lose people</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:16.269" style="s2">but better than what is currently there</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.470" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s the idea for everything we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.269" end="00:41:19.059" style="s2">create like what are you doing for food</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:20.890" style="s2">how much money are you spending how much</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.059" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">time how do we keep bringing that down</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.890" end="00:41:25.329" style="s2">how do we create a system so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:27.099" style="s2">everyone can find connection and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.329" end="00:41:28.420" style="s2">keep making it better and better and</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.099" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">better and what&#39;s going wrong and how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.420" end="00:41:33.609" style="s2">we fix it and what&#39;s not working for you</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:35.500" style="s2">come tell us have a space to say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.609" end="00:41:37.390" style="s2">not working and then be matched up with</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.500" end="00:41:40.390" style="s2">people who that&#39;s also not working for</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.390" end="00:41:42.819" style="s2">and co-create a solution together I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.390" end="00:41:44.170" style="s2">there&#39;s just like an infinite idea for</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.819" end="00:41:45.880" style="s2">the amount of technology we can create</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.170" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">to make our lives better apps to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.880" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">co-parent with the person you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:50.950" style="s2">divorced that like what&#39;s the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.349" style="s2">and how do you deal with money you had</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.950" end="00:41:54.700" style="s2">like this app is created for that how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.349" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">we create something that helps you eat</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.700" end="00:41:57.579" style="s2">better how do we create something to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:41:59.470" style="s2">help spaces that are more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.579" end="00:42:01.650" style="s2">because we all have varying degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.470" end="00:42:04.930" style="s2">physical mental and emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.650" end="00:42:06.430" style="s2">sensory needs and we need to know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.930" end="00:42:06.850" style="s2">out there and how does that co-create</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.430" end="00:42:08.950" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.850" end="00:42:11.290" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a party in here so I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.950" end="00:42:12.910" style="s2">to come and we need to make it work like</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.290" end="00:42:14.770" style="s2">the idea of me creating technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.910" end="00:42:18.910" style="s2">there&#39;s so many benefits creating it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.770" end="00:42:20.650" style="s2">together because there&#39;s as few apps as</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.910" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">possible on your phone and yet they do</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.650" end="00:42:25.300" style="s2">as much as possible and it&#39;s done in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:27.910" style="s2">way you can trust it and you get to own</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.300" end="00:42:29.650" style="s2">your own data and see where it could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.910" end="00:42:32.230" style="s2">used powerfully for your benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.650" end="00:42:34.690" style="s2">society&#39;s benefit and have people</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.230" end="00:42:37.720" style="s2">generate all of those ideas because they</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.690" end="00:42:39.010" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go to work 40 80 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.720" end="00:42:41.290" style="s2">week to provide for their families</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.010" end="00:42:42.670" style="s2">because we figured that out together we</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.290" end="00:42:44.980" style="s2">figured out how to bring the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.670" end="00:42:46.300" style="s2">food down down down how to make it so</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.980" end="00:42:48.550" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way for you even if</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.300" end="00:42:52.870" style="s2">they&#39;re not working to access food to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.550" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">access education to access shelter and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.870" end="00:42:57.000" style="s2">like every weekend crew co-create</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:42:59.110" style="s2">solutions that work for us together</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.000" end="00:43:01.300" style="s2">bypass our governments who are never</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.110" end="00:43:02.620" style="s2">gonna do it they don&#39;t want us not to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.300" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">poor they don&#39;t want us not to be in</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.620" end="00:43:06.940" style="s2">poverty because it&#39;s how they they can</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.090" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">control us and why would you go and work</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.940" end="00:43:11.230" style="s2">if your government was giving you money</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what ubi is that I love the idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.230" end="00:43:14.410" style="s2">of our governments it&#39;s gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.760" end="00:43:15.640" style="s2">decades before they&#39;re gonna they agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.410" end="00:43:19.240" style="s2">to implement it which will be way too</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.640" end="00:43:22.510" style="s2">late we need we can create ubi ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.240" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">we cannot tax ourselves and then dole it</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.510" end="00:43:28.330" style="s2">out to everyone that is not what we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:29.770" style="s2">creating what we can create is okay if</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.330" end="00:43:31.560" style="s2">we don&#39;t have access to jobs because</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.770" end="00:43:34.900" style="s2">they&#39;ve been outsourced and automated</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.560" end="00:43:37.240" style="s2">what do we actually need as humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.900" end="00:43:39.640" style="s2">what we need is humans is food clothing</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.240" end="00:43:42.250" style="s2">shelter water energy intranet right like</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.640" end="00:43:44.200" style="s2">those things we can create solutions for</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.250" end="00:43:45.730" style="s2">not all at once but like what&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.200" end="00:43:47.290" style="s2">there already how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.730" end="00:43:49.450" style="s2">accessible to us how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.290" end="00:43:51.900" style="s2">cheaper how do we make it our own if</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.450" end="00:43:54.520" style="s2">they won&#39;t let us buy it from them and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.900" end="00:43:57.610" style="s2">we can recreate the means of production</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.520" end="00:43:59.260" style="s2">as opposed to seizing the means of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.610" end="00:44:00.310" style="s2">production which is violent and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.260" end="00:44:02.740" style="s2">own it and would probably shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.310" end="00:44:04.360" style="s2">seize it going in and seizing Amazon on</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.740" end="00:44:07.390" style="s2">behalf of the workers it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.360" end="00:44:09.700" style="s2">the workers property but the workers</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.390" end="00:44:11.230" style="s2">could co-create a competing one and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.700" end="00:44:12.490" style="s2">could choose whether we were gonna we</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.230" end="00:44:15.130" style="s2">were gonna participate in that and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.490" end="00:44:16.570" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t if they can&#39;t compete with</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.130" end="00:44:18.490" style="s2">Amazon and they can&#39;t they can&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.570" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">cheaper better faster product and pay</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.490" end="00:44:21.109" style="s2">themselves well</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:25.559" style="s2">that would not work in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.109" end="00:44:28.470" style="s2">but if the user we&#39;re the user decided</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.559" end="00:44:30.390" style="s2">to create a user cooperative that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.470" end="00:44:32.430" style="s2">got our needs met and bulk buy the items</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.390" end="00:44:33.720" style="s2">we bought off of Amazon and delivered</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.430" end="00:44:36.030" style="s2">them in a way that worked for us that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.720" end="00:44:38.900" style="s2">maybe wasn&#39;t twice for 24-hour delivery</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.030" end="00:44:41.250" style="s2">because do we need 24-hour delivery but</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.900" end="00:44:43.170" style="s2">sat down with the worker and we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.250" end="00:44:44.670" style="s2">what do you need to make what do we need</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.830" end="00:48:51.980" style="s2">that&#39;s not really what YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.150" end="00:48:54.140" style="s2">designed for so I don&#39;t really gain</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.980" end="00:48:55.930" style="s2">subscribers no one shares the content no</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.140" end="00:48:58.010" style="s2">one comments the way that I want them to</p>

<p begin="00:48:59.780" end="00:49:03.020" style="s2">or watch it before tea they might watch</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.860" end="00:49:04.760" style="s2">beats bits and pieces of it but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.020" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">designed to work on YouTube&#39;s platform</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.760" end="00:49:09.350" style="s2">what I am doing but I have to work with</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:12.410" style="s2">the social media platforms I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.350" end="00:49:15.619" style="s2">because it&#39;s what&#39;s available idea cafe</p>
