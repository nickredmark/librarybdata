<p begin="00:00:08.360" end="00:00:14.099" style="s2">here to talk about the last the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.730" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">days on earth while I was looking over</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.099" end="00:00:19.260" style="s2">this book this morning and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:22.590" style="s2">beautiful it&#39;s a beautiful kind of epic</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.260" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">poem is it what she wrote called last</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">days on earth and it&#39;s probably much</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">more poignant right now because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:35.579" style="s2">a kind of apocalyptic moment right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:37.500" style="s2">so I should say that you&#39;re a poet</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.579" end="00:00:39.989" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve published quite a number</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">of books won all kinds of awards for</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">your poetry and of course that&#39;s not not</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:48.809" style="s2">what matters what matters is is you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">the quality of what what you do which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.809" end="00:00:55.070" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">real let&#39;s say dedication and beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.070" end="00:01:02.039" style="s2">profundity to your work so and in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">circles I don&#39;t know very many poets I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">mean I haven&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve known poets in the past but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">been talking to a lot of intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">philosophers people who are very you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:18.780" style="s2">know very articulate in the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">realm but I&#39;ve also noticed a big gap in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.780" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">in this scene and and I&#39;m and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">wondering where are the poets and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">also wondering if this Cova nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">business somehow makes poet poetry more</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">important and you eluded kind of to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">prophetic aspect of poetry I think when</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">you said that you know you wrote this in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">2015 and a poet has a sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">happening around the corner and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">been recently talking to Zack Stein and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">genre Vicky about the prophetic aspect</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:51.229" style="s2">of the arts and how they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">important and how we need that in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.229" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">how that might be even more valuable on</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:02.180" style="s2">some in some sense than you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:06.149" style="s2">intellectual our the sociological or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.180" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">let&#39;s say the propositional political</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.149" end="00:02:10.810" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">diagnosis of what of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.810" end="00:02:15.370" style="s2">now which is all very important and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:17.740" style="s2">course all these realms are important</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.370" end="00:02:22.300" style="s2">but but the one thing that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.740" end="00:02:25.150" style="s2">maybe is this aspect of poetry and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.300" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">hoping that&#39;s going to change and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.150" end="00:02:29.560" style="s2">hoping that you can speak to that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.990" style="s2">little bit yeah the importance of poetry</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.560" end="00:02:34.210" style="s2">yeah I would be happy to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.990" end="00:02:37.300" style="s2">um first of all I wouldn&#39;t make this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.210" end="00:02:40.540" style="s2">separation between philosophy and poetry</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.300" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">and politics I&#39;m - to me it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.540" end="00:02:50.140" style="s2">been part of of the of the mesh and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:53.500" style="s2">job of the poet is the root of poet is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.140" end="00:02:57.520" style="s2">to make and and so what poets do is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.500" end="00:03:00.490" style="s2">make articulations of condition and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.520" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">we&#39;re using language and languages</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.490" end="00:03:04.630" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:06.730" style="s2">a broken technology it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.630" end="00:03:09.850" style="s2">system of interrelated symbols that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.730" end="00:03:14.890" style="s2">sort of mapped over a broken ontology so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.850" end="00:03:19.180" style="s2">it&#39;s an epistemological complex that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">think in and and language is how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:24.820" style="s2">represent the world to ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:27.489" style="s2">then we directly weave begin to respond</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.820" end="00:03:30.820" style="s2">to our own representations and so if</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.489" end="00:03:35.260" style="s2">language gets stuck and if language gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.820" end="00:03:38.019" style="s2">codified in a flag which gets made into</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.260" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">some official verse culture then our</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.019" end="00:03:42.700" style="s2">thinking and our being gets stuck and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.250" style="s2">the job of the poet is really to keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.700" end="00:03:49.330" style="s2">language fresh there to come out with</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.250" end="00:03:54.459" style="s2">new articulations of condition and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.330" end="00:03:56.680" style="s2">and the idea is to have a place that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.459" end="00:03:59.320" style="s2">could build together you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.680" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">always say if I write something that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.320" end="00:04:03.130" style="s2">know it&#39;s boring to you if I write</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:06.370" style="s2">something that I know it&#39;s boring to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.130" end="00:04:07.989" style="s2">and so what I try to do is open up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.370" end="00:04:10.630" style="s2">write something that that we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.989" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">explore together and make meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:16.539" style="s2">make sense together you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:19.720" style="s2">more of a democratic process right well</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.539" end="00:04:21.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s a communal aspect right hello</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.720" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">to poetry which is very important which</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.640" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">perhaps gets lost in a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:30.250" style="s2">entertainment or a culture of you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:33.160" style="s2">individual egos sort of you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.250" end="00:04:35.260" style="s2">noticed that in a slam poetry world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.160" end="00:04:40.030" style="s2">often a performance right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.260" end="00:04:42.910" style="s2">performative and it&#39;s it&#39;s but often</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.030" end="00:04:44.890" style="s2">that lets say that the depth is lost in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.910" end="00:04:49.510" style="s2">that and it&#39;s also about individual egos</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.890" end="00:04:52.690" style="s2">you know yeah so so I think we I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.510" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">the poets are you know the poet&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.690" end="00:04:57.250" style="s2">are valuable or a meaningful are deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">than that right yeah yeah well I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.250" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">now you know there&#39;s this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.830" end="00:05:06.010" style="s2">difference between you know a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:09.220" style="s2">performance right and and really a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.010" end="00:05:11.560" style="s2">poetic explorations and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.220" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong I have no problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.560" end="00:05:16.330" style="s2">with what slam poets are you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:17.080" style="s2">yeah you know that&#39;s that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.330" end="00:05:18.970" style="s2">well and fine</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.080" end="00:05:20.950" style="s2">what&#39;s the content I think that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.970" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">criticizing there yeah the content it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.950" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">can be somewhat either overtly pull it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:29.169" style="s2">to me it become it&#39;s politicized and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:31.660" style="s2">that it loses something and all or else</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.169" end="00:05:34.419" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just biographical</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.660" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a narcissistic on one level or</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.419" end="00:05:43.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s some kind of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.110" end="00:05:44.500" style="s2">ideological you know some kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.240" end="00:05:46.900" style="s2">know expression of ideological</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.500" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">possession yeah but then but then the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.900" end="00:05:52.270" style="s2">poets the poets that are valuable to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:54.100" style="s2">are not you know a political there is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.270" end="00:05:58.630" style="s2">politics there but it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.100" end="00:06:01.060" style="s2">more radical and deep do you agree with</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.630" end="00:06:04.120" style="s2">out of my yeah I absolutely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.060" end="00:06:06.910" style="s2">that you know in fact in in in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.120" end="00:06:09.790" style="s2">about this conversation because you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.910" end="00:06:12.010" style="s2">I spoke and we had planned this I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.790" end="00:06:14.890" style="s2">brought a few things to read to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.010" end="00:06:17.740" style="s2">demonstrate you know probably that point</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.890" end="00:06:19.570" style="s2">that you were just saying so you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.740" end="00:06:23.050" style="s2">what I would I&#39;d like to agree it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.570" end="00:06:27.490" style="s2">just like a one page thing that I was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.050" end="00:06:30.940" style="s2">contemplation on on what poetry does</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.490" end="00:06:32.889" style="s2">towards agreement an agreement towards a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.940" end="00:06:37.330" style="s2">peacemaking and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.889" end="00:06:41.169" style="s2">way of of coming into into alignment</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.330" end="00:06:44.139" style="s2">between between people so in and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.169" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">reading this not as not as a discourse</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.139" end="00:06:49.419" style="s2">an intellectual discourse but as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:52.150" style="s2">demonstration of how to use language in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.419" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">a different way so I&#39;ll read this and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.150" end="00:06:57.819" style="s2">then you know go for it awesome okay all</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">right so poetry or a language is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.819" end="00:07:02.199" style="s2">playground we&#39;re invited to explore to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">Prague the open space and poke into</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.720" end="00:12:31.260" style="s2">was hearing you read this poem they</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:33.660" style="s2">would they might get a completely</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.660" end="00:12:37.560" style="s2">know I got stuck on certain words</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.250" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">because that&#39;s was where I was at at</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.560" end="00:12:42.030" style="s2">that moment that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">that&#39;s I was thinking of rupture and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.030" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">rapture of those two words because</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.260" end="00:12:52.780" style="s2">because of this feeling you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.240" end="00:12:54.970" style="s2">this feeling at the moment of this sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.780" end="00:12:57.490" style="s2">of rupture of the ordinary like</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.970" end="00:13:01.330" style="s2">everything going kind of weird and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.490" end="00:13:04.690" style="s2">there&#39;s also a kind of coming into being</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.330" end="00:13:07.450" style="s2">of something else which is ecstatic so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.690" end="00:13:10.570" style="s2">it&#39;s just suffering an ecstasy meeting</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.450" end="00:13:11.830" style="s2">or or something like that right does</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.570" end="00:13:15.310" style="s2">that make any sense when I guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.830" end="00:13:18.930" style="s2">absolutely it does and and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.310" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">the the poetry that I try to produce</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.930" end="00:13:26.460" style="s2">either helps a reader get to that space</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:31.150" style="s2">or process through that space or that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.460" end="00:13:34.210" style="s2">allows allows a field okay a field that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.150" end="00:13:37.270" style="s2">the play in to explore you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.210" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">not saying that what I do is wide open</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.270" end="00:13:44.380" style="s2">you know every every every work I do has</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">has an intention and an intention or a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.380" end="00:13:50.080" style="s2">thought or an idea you know the way I</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:51.910" style="s2">like to describe it is like you know if</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.080" end="00:13:54.340" style="s2">we&#39;re playing in the playground you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.910" end="00:13:56.950" style="s2">and you could imagine you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.340" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">kids and and when the kids go to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.950" end="00:14:02.380" style="s2">playground they all do different things</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">you know and and so their experience of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.380" end="00:14:06.850" style="s2">the playground is going to be totally</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.420" end="00:14:09.100" style="s2">different from from one another however</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.850" end="00:14:11.200" style="s2">they all could agree that they were in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.100" end="00:14:12.850" style="s2">the same playground mm-hmm so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.200" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">form to it as what you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.850" end="00:14:17.170" style="s2">not just total formless free jazz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:19.660" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s there is a form</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.170" end="00:14:23.430" style="s2">and yeah and also I think that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.660" end="00:14:26.700" style="s2">interesting analogy because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.430" end="00:14:29.080" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not and again this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.700" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">what I was talking about with John John</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.080" end="00:14:34.360" style="s2">and Zach or what they were saying is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:36.640" style="s2">this atomized individual we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.360" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">one thing right right all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.640" end="00:14:40.510" style="s2">different personalities and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">subpersonalities within us and they make</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.510" end="00:14:48.640" style="s2">up a kind of chaotic symphony of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:50.590" style="s2">and so so of different types and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.640" end="00:14:51.820" style="s2">archetypes and personalities and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.590" end="00:14:55.270" style="s2">and they&#39;re all in this playground</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.820" end="00:14:57.640" style="s2">uh-huh experimenting and trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.270" end="00:14:59.690" style="s2">together and coming in and out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.640" end="00:15:02.510" style="s2">harmony and and collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.690" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">yeah yeah and you know that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.510" end="00:15:07.730" style="s2">that&#39;s it and you know it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:10.040" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of funny when I think about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.730" end="00:15:13.070" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve written a bunch of books and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.040" end="00:15:15.500" style="s2">every book every project is radically</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.070" end="00:15:17.930" style="s2">different from the one that went before</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.500" end="00:15:22.220" style="s2">it which is a really bad career move but</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.930" end="00:15:24.770" style="s2">but I mean that&#39;s how how how the poetry</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.220" end="00:15:26.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad career move because people</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.770" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">want you to be a certain thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.930" end="00:15:32.120" style="s2">exactly right and and when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:34.220" style="s2">disappoint them they reminds me of Bob</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.120" end="00:15:36.590" style="s2">Dylan a little bit of like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.220" end="00:15:38.900" style="s2">it was I was changing and people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.590" end="00:15:40.580" style="s2">always reacting to that and in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.900" end="00:15:42.140" style="s2">negative way every time he changed</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.580" end="00:15:46.400" style="s2">something about himself but he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.140" end="00:15:47.900" style="s2">always sort of a step ahead of of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.400" end="00:15:51.590" style="s2">time he was always just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.900" end="00:15:53.960" style="s2">ahead of the time yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.590" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">and but it&#39;s that exploration and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.960" end="00:16:00.760" style="s2">said that allowing to to come through</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:04.670" style="s2">what what that time is just becoming so</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.760" end="00:16:06.710" style="s2">like every time I write a a book I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.670" end="00:16:08.990" style="s2">learned from it you know if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.710" end="00:16:11.870" style="s2">teaching me something then then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.990" end="00:16:15.530" style="s2">probably wrong hmm yeah I understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.870" end="00:16:18.350" style="s2">that that&#39;s right yeah cuz cuz if you if</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.530" end="00:16:19.880" style="s2">you know where you&#39;re going when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.350" end="00:16:22.040" style="s2">writing a poem it&#39;s not going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.880" end="00:16:24.290" style="s2">poem no it&#39;s just going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:27.050" style="s2">regurgitation of what you already know</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.290" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">so the poem has to be breaking into new</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.050" end="00:16:32.210" style="s2">ground for yourself you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">hearing something ahead of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.210" end="00:16:37.790" style="s2">right hey well exactly oh yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">hearing your divine double I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.790" end="00:16:43.460" style="s2">speak to you mmm that&#39;s good waiter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:46.010" style="s2">that well that is exactly it you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.460" end="00:16:48.350" style="s2">when you&#39;re writing a poem or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.010" end="00:16:51.290" style="s2">creating any part of any sort of art</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.350" end="00:16:53.780" style="s2">it&#39;s already there right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.290" end="00:16:55.400" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about time before time</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.780" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really exist I mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.400" end="00:16:59.720" style="s2">perception of duration and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:02.750" style="s2">certainly your relation to you to where</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.720" end="00:17:04.189" style="s2">you are at that moment and when when</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.750" end="00:17:05.569" style="s2">you&#39;re doing a creative project like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.189" end="00:17:09.410" style="s2">when I have when I&#39;m working on a book</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.569" end="00:17:12.230" style="s2">you know I&#39;m just well the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.410" end="00:17:13.370" style="s2">that project is always just waiting okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.230" end="00:17:16.670" style="s2">so I just wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.370" end="00:17:20.360" style="s2">until I send something and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.670" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">it&#39;s about following it through so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.360" end="00:17:24.800" style="s2">know I&#39;ll get you in a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:27.050" style="s2">know I&#39;ll hear usually it&#39;s a vibration</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.800" end="00:17:28.250" style="s2">or a sound you know so the musicality is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.050" end="00:17:30.230" style="s2">extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.250" end="00:17:31.790" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t start in language if it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.230" end="00:17:33.080" style="s2">starts in language I know I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.790" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">about something and I&#39;d rather write an</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.080" end="00:17:37.040" style="s2">essay or do CrossFit</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:45.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not that so where does it start and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.040" end="00:17:46.940" style="s2">a feeling of discomfort or or ecstasy or</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.140" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">what what it where does the feeling what</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.940" end="00:17:53.150" style="s2">is the feeling where does a poem start</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">yeah it starts in a feeling yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.150" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:18:05.720" style="s2">embodied sensing you know in in it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:07.340" style="s2">it has no no no qualities that I could</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.720" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">ascribe to it I can&#39;t say it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.340" end="00:18:12.260" style="s2">happier sigh other joyful or any of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:16.940" style="s2">but it&#39;s a feeling you know it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:20.030" style="s2">like a whole whole vibration and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.940" end="00:18:22.360" style="s2">then you know some words will come and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.030" end="00:18:23.540" style="s2">then I&#39;ll sense into that and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.360" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.540" end="00:18:29.570" style="s2">and it&#39;s always out there just just that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:32.390" style="s2">ahead and I try to follow it the best I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.570" end="00:18:34.700" style="s2">can and and what&#39;s really funny in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.390" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">process is because you&#39;re collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.700" end="00:18:42.980" style="s2">time and and you&#39;re also you also sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:44.750" style="s2">when you have it right you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.980" end="00:18:52.429" style="s2">it&#39;s an art of really feeling your way</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.750" end="00:18:55.790" style="s2">through yeah you know if it if it like</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.429" end="00:18:56.900" style="s2">if it feels wrong it&#39;s probably it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.790" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">probably dead weight or it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.900" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">not essential or it&#39;s probably mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:07.030" style="s2">yeah yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s that the process</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:09.500" style="s2">is really about a tuning into that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.030" end="00:19:12.260" style="s2">you know like all my books I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.500" end="00:19:14.780" style="s2">it you know I just I was gonna ask you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.260" end="00:19:17.720" style="s2">about that actually I was gonna ask you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.780" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">about that so you don&#39;t edit at all no</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.720" end="00:19:22.820" style="s2">because I so you work like Jack Herer</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:25.310" style="s2">kind of just like a you know you let it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.820" end="00:19:27.140" style="s2">all go out or or well you know there</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.310" end="00:19:29.630" style="s2">must be some preparation or some</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.140" end="00:19:33.590" style="s2">well the preparation is really sitting</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.630" end="00:19:36.679" style="s2">in in being with that that thing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.590" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">wants to be expressed and and in really</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.679" end="00:19:43.610" style="s2">doing a practice to get into a space</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:47.900" style="s2">where you&#39;re ready to receive if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.610" end="00:19:50.900" style="s2">will and and so what and it&#39;s oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.900" end="00:19:52.790" style="s2">nothing comes out you know with Kerouac</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.900" end="00:19:55.250" style="s2">and you know those guys who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.790" end="00:19:57.590" style="s2">you know stream of conscious whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.250" end="00:20:00.770" style="s2">all comes out and then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.590" end="00:20:02.929" style="s2">editing or not sure for me it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.770" end="00:20:04.549" style="s2">about waiting it&#39;s about you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.929" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">pulling the hand backs like you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.549" end="00:20:09.110" style="s2">that&#39;s not it that&#39;s not it and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.040" end="00:20:11.720" style="s2">when I sense that it&#39;s right it just it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.110" end="00:20:13.309" style="s2">just comes out and that means so if</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.720" end="00:20:15.620" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that&#39;s not it aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.309" end="00:20:17.720" style="s2">editing a little bit in your mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.620" end="00:20:20.270" style="s2">trying to get I&#39;m trying to I get get</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.720" end="00:20:22.700" style="s2">around and get to this idea of not</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.270" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">editing cuz it&#39;s exactly the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.700" end="00:20:29.660" style="s2">how I work I I just go over stuff over</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:32.090" style="s2">and over again until it till I get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.660" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">something essential I mean and I write</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.090" end="00:20:37.549" style="s2">songs right so long has to be it has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:40.820" style="s2">be a bullet it has to have all or it has</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.549" end="00:20:42.350" style="s2">to be a complete thing i if there&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.820" end="00:20:44.120" style="s2">there&#39;s you know where&#39;s it where&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.350" end="00:20:46.130" style="s2">think a poem you have much more room and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.120" end="00:20:48.230" style="s2">space to explore you have a larger space</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:50.630" style="s2">to explore it perhaps than a psalm where</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.230" end="00:20:53.150" style="s2">you have to if you fit yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.630" end="00:20:54.980" style="s2">some kind of form and I find the form</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.150" end="00:20:58.120" style="s2">kind of freeing or I kind of find the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.980" end="00:21:00.710" style="s2">limitations freeing and I find that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.120" end="00:21:03.620" style="s2">perhaps I don&#39;t trust myself enough to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.710" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">not edit yeah wait you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.620" end="00:21:09.080" style="s2">bringing up a really interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:12.309" style="s2">and this is what I spoke a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.080" end="00:21:16.460" style="s2">about at the conference you and I were</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.309" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">at where we met in he back in September</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.460" end="00:21:21.770" style="s2">and and there is a meta move that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:25.549" style="s2">happens in that process</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.770" end="00:21:29.720" style="s2">and in the the meta move is that you see</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.549" end="00:21:32.900" style="s2">yourself writing you know so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.720" end="00:21:34.790" style="s2">a there&#39;s a perspective that has the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:37.400" style="s2">sense and when I say see that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.790" end="00:21:40.120" style="s2">too strong but that there&#39;s an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.400" end="00:21:42.460" style="s2">of what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.120" end="00:21:45.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re you&#39;re right the editing</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.460" end="00:21:47.170" style="s2">happens in that meta level and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.430" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">where I&#39;m saying no you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.170" end="00:21:52.090" style="s2">where I can pull it back if I see that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">or fight sense that that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.090" end="00:22:00.490" style="s2">following that the trajectory of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">future thing that wants to come in so</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.490" end="00:22:05.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a dialogue that goes all right</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:07.480" style="s2">before it before the poem comes into</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.290" end="00:22:09.370" style="s2">being so there&#39;s a dialogical process</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.480" end="00:22:09.810" style="s2">perhaps we could have to look at it that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.370" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.810" end="00:22:14.020" style="s2">rehearsal because I felt like I felt</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:16.270" style="s2">like when you were reading the poem to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.020" end="00:22:18.870" style="s2">me actually I felt like that you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.270" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">going through a dialogue with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.870" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">with different aspects of yourself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:27.580" style="s2">well for that it was specifically around</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:30.820" style="s2">an agreement you know so so that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.580" end="00:22:34.780" style="s2">concept was agreement and in and how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.820" end="00:22:39.190" style="s2">we how do we agree yeah ie in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.780" end="00:22:41.260" style="s2">or prevent conflict and and what is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.190" end="00:22:45.970" style="s2">what is the language is role in that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.260" end="00:22:48.040" style="s2">you know in the the dialogue is also</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.970" end="00:22:49.720" style="s2">part of the problem cuz it&#39;s - and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.040" end="00:22:54.040" style="s2">not interested in - I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.720" end="00:22:56.590" style="s2">three you know the the the two is really</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.040" end="00:22:58.870" style="s2">the the epistemological roots of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.590" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">technology of language okay well three</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.870" end="00:23:04.090" style="s2">is interesting as three is like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:05.920" style="s2">the dialogue between you and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.090" end="00:23:09.580" style="s2">element your dialogue you against and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.920" end="00:23:12.220" style="s2">then there&#39;s a third thing a third</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.580" end="00:23:13.570" style="s2">element right now which is the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.220" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">the whole thing you could call if the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:17.500" style="s2">logo sir we were calling it the logos or</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.530" style="s2">something like that which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.500" end="00:23:22.300" style="s2">actually the third element like I agree</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.530" end="00:23:22.930" style="s2">if it&#39;s just a dialogue of just back and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.300" end="00:23:25.330" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.930" end="00:23:27.010" style="s2">there&#39;s no inspiration there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.330" end="00:23:30.130" style="s2">just where there might be a rivalry or</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.010" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">there might be agreement but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.130" end="00:23:35.260" style="s2">the third part that gives you the this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">inspiration right right you know and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.260" end="00:23:43.900" style="s2">comes back to you know just just our own</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:46.750" style="s2">psychology or makeup is you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.900" end="00:23:50.170" style="s2">language begins when you could say I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.750" end="00:23:53.980" style="s2">write and and at that point you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.170" end="00:23:56.950" style="s2">separation and so I is contradicting</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.980" end="00:24:00.610" style="s2">instinct from the knot I so you&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.950" end="00:24:03.130" style="s2">that that duality yeah and and that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.610" end="00:24:05.799" style="s2">the problem and you need the vow that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.130" end="00:24:08.500" style="s2">and there&#39;s the that&#39;s the third element</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.799" end="00:24:10.900" style="s2">like I&#39;m thinking of boobers formulation</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.500" end="00:24:12.520" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s the I in the it now but</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.900" end="00:24:16.630" style="s2">then there&#39;s a space in between which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.520" end="00:24:19.510" style="s2">the vow you know or you know for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.630" end="00:24:22.600" style="s2">more it&#39;s more Buddhist I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.510" end="00:24:26.049" style="s2">in it it&#39;s the the non-dualistic dualism</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.600" end="00:24:31.990" style="s2">that that makes the third for me so so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.049" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">it is it is the I and the not I that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.990" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">that become held in a non-dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:41.140" style="s2">dualism they exist but you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:47.890" style="s2">them apart from from one another and not</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.140" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">that dualism hmm yeah it&#39;s not not a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.890" end="00:24:55.059" style="s2">negation right it&#39;s not an aggregation</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">nourifusion it is holding it&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.059" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">the the the the this is the ability that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:04.330" style="s2">that they had to live in the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:07.240" style="s2">okay of the not knowing if that space of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.330" end="00:25:08.950" style="s2">not knowing knowing he you know in and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.240" end="00:25:13.780" style="s2">this is where it gets really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.950" end="00:25:19.090" style="s2">to articulate something using language</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.780" end="00:25:20.470" style="s2">that has the the the the goal to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.090" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">articulate something that&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.470" end="00:25:24.790" style="s2">language and you know that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">that&#39;s poetry you know and that&#39;s music</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.790" end="00:25:29.830" style="s2">and that&#39;s art that&#39;s that&#39;s that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:34.780" style="s2">takes you to to a different a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.830" end="00:25:36.700" style="s2">space hmm so you are objecting to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.780" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">vow in the sense because it&#39;s it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.700" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">much of a let&#39;s say theistic concept or</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:47.049" style="s2">something like that no it&#39;s a it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:49.929" style="s2">it&#39;s the separation that that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.049" end="00:25:54.460" style="s2">problem with mm-hmm yeah the dualism the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.929" end="00:25:56.950" style="s2">dualism that that that that forms the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.460" end="00:26:00.270" style="s2">epistemology I mean if we&#39;re thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.950" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">language and language it&#39;s beast is is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.270" end="00:26:07.210" style="s2">technology of but doesn&#39;t the vow allow</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:10.590" style="s2">you to transcend do dualism in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.210" end="00:26:13.650" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer me versus you it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.590" end="00:26:17.950" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the relationship like</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.650" end="00:26:20.260" style="s2">like our friend Nora Bateson speaks</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.950" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">about a lot huh yeah yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.260" end="00:26:26.410" style="s2">relationship of everything to everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:29.740" style="s2">else you know that the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.410" end="00:26:32.650" style="s2">complexity Nora would say you know in</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.740" end="00:26:36.310" style="s2">the ecosystems that the complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.650" end="00:26:38.920" style="s2">ecosystems in relation to each other in</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.310" end="00:26:43.150" style="s2">a mutual learning and and say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.920" end="00:26:45.700" style="s2">Norris Norris main point is that the is</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.150" end="00:26:48.820" style="s2">is that the complexities are always</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.700" end="00:26:51.820" style="s2">continuing to learn and and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.820" end="00:26:54.940" style="s2">adjusting in relation to everything that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.820" end="00:27:00.310" style="s2">being everything that goes on and in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.940" end="00:27:02.410" style="s2">in poetry I you know that is like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.310" end="00:27:05.470" style="s2">the piece I read which is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.410" end="00:27:07.830" style="s2">poetic essay is really an attempt of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.470" end="00:27:10.150" style="s2">creating a complex ecosystem of thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.830" end="00:27:13.480" style="s2">you know thought of feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.150" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">musicality of breaking through that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.480" end="00:27:21.280" style="s2">separation so that you could enter in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:25.020" style="s2">and and and be in in relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.280" end="00:27:27.220" style="s2">hmm that makes me think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.020" end="00:27:29.940" style="s2">hospitality that is necessary here</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.220" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">there&#39;s you have to invite people into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.940" end="00:27:36.820" style="s2">space which is hospitable in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:39.580" style="s2">but also challenging and that which</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.820" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">makes you you know grow and learn yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.580" end="00:27:47.680" style="s2">well you know it to me it&#39;s about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:50.860" style="s2">about did the democracy of the page you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.680" end="00:27:53.680" style="s2">know in it&#39;s about participation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.860" end="00:27:55.690" style="s2">this is you know I often get labeled as</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.680" end="00:27:59.500" style="s2">experimental and there&#39;s a whole group</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.690" end="00:28:05.020" style="s2">of us cut from the 70s 80s 90s and still</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.500" end="00:28:08.710" style="s2">continuing who who are essentially left</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.020" end="00:28:10.390" style="s2">out or we&#39;re really resisted by you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.710" end="00:28:13.720" style="s2">what we&#39;ll call official burst culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:17.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a mechanism that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.720" end="00:28:20.509" style="s2">this kind of disruptive thought poetry</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.260" end="00:28:22.909" style="s2">in in the world or in the academy</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.509" end="00:28:25.190" style="s2">because they&#39;re you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.909" end="00:28:28.369" style="s2">controlled it&#39;s controlled by by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.190" end="00:28:30.859" style="s2">Academy by the publishers and so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.369" end="00:28:33.709" style="s2">of us had to go yeah it&#39;s kind of a blue</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.859" end="00:28:34.999" style="s2">Church of poetry exactly so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.709" end="00:28:38.959" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.999" end="00:28:41.599" style="s2">you know sort of mmm yeah right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.959" end="00:28:45.529" style="s2">and and there&#39;s there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.599" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">a more or less a suppression or you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.529" end="00:28:50.869" style="s2">trying to to keep out you know these</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:54.139" style="s2">this sort of this sort of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.869" end="00:28:58.009" style="s2">because it is it&#39;s just very disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.139" end="00:29:00.169" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t because if if you if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.009" end="00:29:03.199" style="s2">can&#39;t tell you or if you can&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.169" end="00:29:06.079" style="s2">can&#39;t say what a poem means or have some</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.199" end="00:29:07.669" style="s2">status because you understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.079" end="00:29:09.889" style="s2">poem means and somebody else doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.669" end="00:29:13.069" style="s2">this is why you know when people hear</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.889" end="00:29:15.409" style="s2">poetry they think they go cold because</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.069" end="00:29:18.589" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been trained that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.409" end="00:29:21.109" style="s2">poetry has the secret message and only</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.589" end="00:29:24.499" style="s2">very smart and bright well-educated</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.109" end="00:29:26.869" style="s2">people huh yet it you say no and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.499" end="00:29:28.489" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying is no no no no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.869" end="00:29:33.319" style="s2">you know we have a strong theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.489" end="00:29:35.869" style="s2">base and that we operate from but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.319" end="00:29:38.209" style="s2">poetry is you said is is in an inviting</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.869" end="00:29:41.239" style="s2">place it&#39;s a place it&#39;s a place for</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.830" end="00:32:22.530" style="s2">yeah I was thinking of the exit wound</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:25.590" style="s2">you know so hugs it named his name of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.530" end="00:32:30.659" style="s2">um so and that always comes last</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.590" end="00:32:32.730" style="s2">um is how what what what what what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.730" end="00:32:37.710" style="s2">price of exiting thought you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.909" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">we do that you know in this align you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.710" end="00:32:41.130" style="s2">know the thought has been thought out</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:43.020" style="s2">you know cuz he you can you can oh that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.130" end="00:32:45.539" style="s2">deadline struck me - yeah the thought</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.020" end="00:32:47.070" style="s2">has been thought out yeah and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.539" end="00:32:49.640" style="s2">all around right you know it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.640" end="00:32:56.900" style="s2">and at the end of at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.809" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">philosophy at the end of science at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.900" end="00:33:04.340" style="s2">end of any any deep any deep dive on any</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:06.770" style="s2">particular topic you&#39;re gonna come to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.340" end="00:33:07.820" style="s2">this place where you can&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.770" end="00:33:10.700" style="s2">through anymore</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.820" end="00:33:13.250" style="s2">and and there&#39;s that&#39;s because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.700" end="00:33:15.650" style="s2">different type of knowing there and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.250" end="00:33:20.120" style="s2">that knowing is very resistant to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.650" end="00:33:24.049" style="s2">articulation and and poetry&#39;s job is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.120" end="00:33:26.870" style="s2">try to articulate that you know can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.049" end="00:33:29.150" style="s2">articulated exactly exactly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.870" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">paradox always at the heart of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.150" end="00:33:33.500" style="s2">well there is the paradox and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:35.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like Keats said right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.500" end="00:33:38.840" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the the ability of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.690" end="00:33:42.500" style="s2">poet to have the negative capability to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.840" end="00:33:46.220" style="s2">exist and be comfortable in the not</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.500" end="00:33:48.280" style="s2">knowing in in the unknown and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.220" end="00:33:50.419" style="s2">very frustrating for a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.280" end="00:33:53.299" style="s2">especially for especially in Western</p>

<p begin="00:33:53.299" end="00:33:58.549" style="s2">where we&#39;ve just been reductionist and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.030" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">scientific and you know we divide</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.549" end="00:34:03.409" style="s2">something and study it and have have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:08.810" style="s2">you know have an understanding of it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.409" end="00:34:10.790" style="s2">then you know and it&#39;s broadside it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.810" end="00:34:12.589" style="s2">brought us a great deal it&#39;s compromise</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.410" end="00:36:02.060" style="s2">so I know what I know what to expect</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.140" end="00:36:04.190" style="s2">from Joe because Raisa</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.060" end="00:36:05.830" style="s2">he&#39;s a poet right whereas somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.190" end="00:36:10.610" style="s2">I know what to expect from them because</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.830" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah so you know that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.610" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">part of the the you know my my project</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:19.850" style="s2">and I hate using the that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:21.980" style="s2">language but it&#39;s been the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.850" end="00:36:25.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve been interested in since forever</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.980" end="00:36:27.770" style="s2">is you know I started out in science I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.700" end="00:36:30.830" style="s2">was gonna be a doctor sighs really in</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.770" end="00:36:32.830" style="s2">the hardcore sciences yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.830" end="00:36:35.360" style="s2">around the time of university that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.830" end="00:36:37.820" style="s2">realized at the endpoint of science is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.360" end="00:36:40.370" style="s2">going to be to disprove itself because</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.820" end="00:36:42.830" style="s2">if the premise is a hold on you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.370" end="00:36:46.550" style="s2">can only cut things up so so much and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.830" end="00:36:50.390" style="s2">that reductionist point is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.550" end="00:36:53.720" style="s2">be useful at some at some point now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.390" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">and and so okay so what do you do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.720" end="00:36:57.740" style="s2">know so how do you bring the whole back</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:00.680" style="s2">how do you bring a whole back into you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.740" end="00:37:02.300" style="s2">to residents in in a community then in</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.680" end="00:37:04.700" style="s2">that that that&#39;s that&#39;s the project so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.300" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">started meeting series started group</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.700" end="00:37:12.830" style="s2">projects you know just just get into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:14.120" style="s2">conversation with with artists other</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.830" end="00:37:16.670" style="s2">poets you know people</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.120" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking like this and you know so</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:29.270" style="s2">we invented just out of necessity a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:32.360" style="s2">of reading you know traditional you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.270" end="00:37:34.910" style="s2">money and and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.360" end="00:37:37.490" style="s2">by that I mean it&#39;s always been in</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.550" end="00:38:40.580" style="s2">traditional way because we put we put</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.100" end="00:38:44.390" style="s2">our energy into this creative act which</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.580" end="00:38:48.260" style="s2">entails a sacrifice of often material</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.390" end="00:38:48.770" style="s2">comforts or or or job status or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.260" end="00:38:51.320" style="s2">it might be</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.770" end="00:38:55.300" style="s2">well that&#39;s it it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.320" end="00:38:58.730" style="s2">vulnerable only from the sense of of of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.300" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">societal expectations and the means of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.730" end="00:39:06.860" style="s2">making a living now now it&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:10.310" style="s2">resilient because at this moment you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.860" end="00:39:12.980" style="s2">know yeah you know it&#39;s hard to say but</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.310" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">but this really isn&#39;t being on lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.980" end="00:39:18.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t really any that much different</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:22.150" style="s2">than my normal day-to-day you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.170" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s always been about you know be</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.150" end="00:39:27.530" style="s2">trying to do the creative and going in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:29.930" style="s2">and and in doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.530" end="00:39:31.970" style="s2">deep introspection and all not all that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.930" end="00:39:34.220" style="s2">that a lot of people at this moment are</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.970" end="00:39:35.900" style="s2">are having I would imagine a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.220" end="00:39:37.550" style="s2">difficult time well people are freaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.900" end="00:39:40.310" style="s2">out perhaps because they&#39;ve been living</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.550" end="00:39:42.590" style="s2">in a transactional world and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.310" end="00:39:44.690" style="s2">getting the feedback they&#39;re used to now</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.590" end="00:39:47.360" style="s2">so they&#39;re stuck with themselves yep and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.690" end="00:39:51.530" style="s2">in worse than that they&#39;ve defined</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.360" end="00:39:53.450" style="s2">themselves in relation to externals you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.530" end="00:39:56.300" style="s2">know they they are their job they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.450" end="00:40:00.200" style="s2">there they know there&#39;s there&#39;s spot on</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.300" end="00:40:01.940" style="s2">this fourteen that I don&#39;t know so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.200" end="00:40:05.450" style="s2">it&#39;s I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.940" end="00:40:09.410" style="s2">pain out there right now certainly that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.450" end="00:40:11.120" style="s2">it hurts me and I feel that deeply but</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.410" end="00:40:13.580" style="s2">that gives me another insight to why the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.120" end="00:40:17.390" style="s2">the poet is is kind of important right</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.580" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">now and that is that that in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.390" end="00:40:25.640" style="s2">society we have a narrow vision of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:27.470" style="s2">a person is and the poet opens up a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.640" end="00:40:30.170" style="s2">portal where we can see that the person</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.470" end="00:40:32.360" style="s2">is to something much larger and much</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.170" end="00:40:37.550" style="s2">more mysterious and must let much less</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.360" end="00:40:43.160" style="s2">atomistic and much more of a symphony of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.550" end="00:40:46.490" style="s2">voices yeah yeah and and and also that</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.160" end="00:40:48.950" style="s2">that that goes for for every individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.490" end="00:40:51.830" style="s2">yeah so the individual has to give</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.950" end="00:40:54.250" style="s2">themselves the permission to say didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.830" end="00:40:58.070" style="s2">see themselves and that fed multitude</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.250" end="00:40:59.660" style="s2">mmm you know and at that point you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.070" end="00:41:04.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not vulnerable all its it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.660" end="00:41:07.490" style="s2">very rich it&#39;s incredibly rich yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.190" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a process sure and so that the poet</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.490" end="00:41:15.860" style="s2">you know the poet say sorry to interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:18.500" style="s2">go ahead continue here this case a poet</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.860" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">said you know in society that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.500" end="00:41:24.110" style="s2">undergoing change like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">political change often get rounded up</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.110" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">you know because the poets are dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:30.020" style="s2">yeah you were I was just about to bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:31.700" style="s2">that up the idea of danger you had one</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.020" end="00:41:37.060" style="s2">of your questions was why are the poets</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.700" end="00:41:40.130" style="s2">and artists artists dangerous and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.060" end="00:41:42.980" style="s2">it&#39;s because they they break the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.130" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">the rules of the current exactly norms</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.980" end="00:41:48.830" style="s2">right and which is a threat to people</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:51.170" style="s2">but if they&#39;re responsible poets right</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.830" end="00:41:56.510" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re offering a different a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.170" end="00:41:58.070" style="s2">new vision of the world right so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.510" end="00:42:02.600" style="s2">not that just that they&#39;re tearing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.070" end="00:42:04.100" style="s2">tearing the it down yeah well you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.600" end="00:42:07.340" style="s2">don&#39;t think poets tear down</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.100" end="00:42:10.250" style="s2">um I think the danger you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.340" end="00:42:11.750" style="s2">close but the way I would read that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.250" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">opponents are dangerous because they</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.750" end="00:42:17.570" style="s2">allow the society and see the repressive</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:21.950" style="s2">mechanisms and that&#39;s what the power</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.570" end="00:42:23.810" style="s2">thing that be don&#39;t want and and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.950" end="00:42:25.790" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s danger that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.810" end="00:42:27.830" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of hatred towards the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.790" end="00:42:31.910" style="s2">poet or something there&#39;s hatred towards</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.830" end="00:42:37.400" style="s2">this type of person who is not it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.910" end="00:42:40.130" style="s2">nonlinear who has you know might might</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.400" end="00:42:44.980" style="s2">appear to be crazy at times might might</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.130" end="00:42:48.200" style="s2">not be easily categorizable or</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.980" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">understandable you know all right</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.200" end="00:42:54.950" style="s2">and you probably know being in poetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:56.870" style="s2">circles that you know I think artistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.950" end="00:42:59.330" style="s2">people in general are sensitive and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.870" end="00:43:01.850" style="s2">often they have substance problems or</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.330" end="00:43:06.140" style="s2">certain mental illness problems or they</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.850" end="00:43:11.750" style="s2">tend to fall into a lot of they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.140" end="00:43:15.290" style="s2">they tend to you know go into dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.750" end="00:43:17.360" style="s2">territories psychological territories</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.290" end="00:43:19.240" style="s2">and sometimes they they make it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.360" end="00:43:22.460" style="s2">sometimes they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.240" end="00:43:25.250" style="s2">yes yes there did this you probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.460" end="00:43:27.260" style="s2">known a few people like that and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:30.350" style="s2">well you know I thought I wouldn&#39;t rule</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.260" end="00:43:32.840" style="s2">myself out you know because when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.350" end="00:43:34.730" style="s2">in in that process I mean you&#39;ve what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.840" end="00:43:37.070" style="s2">mean you&#39;re still here on writing poetry</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.730" end="00:43:39.590" style="s2">and you&#39;re still you&#39;re still going but</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.070" end="00:43:43.310" style="s2">I think a lot of people you know are</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.590" end="00:43:44.840" style="s2">casualties yeah yeah well you know III</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.310" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">think that goes through it for artists</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.840" end="00:43:51.050" style="s2">you know I or any any sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:53.140" style="s2">individual you know let&#39;s say we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.050" end="00:43:57.849" style="s2">say an artist as a person with some</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.140" end="00:43:59.710" style="s2">kind of poetic capacity yeah they&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.849" end="00:44:03.069" style="s2">they&#39;re really an artist so poetry is is</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.710" end="00:44:06.430" style="s2">one written poetry is one aspect of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.069" end="00:44:08.190" style="s2">but yeah not exactly exactly and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.430" end="00:44:11.019" style="s2">know and I wouldn&#39;t even make the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.190" end="00:44:12.819" style="s2">categorical distinction between poet and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.019" end="00:44:17.529" style="s2">visual artists the musician and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.819" end="00:44:23.039" style="s2">architect and you know yeah or or you</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.529" end="00:44:23.039" style="s2">could do anything in life artistically</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.819" end="00:44:29.049" style="s2">sure you know again that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.130" end="00:44:31.180" style="s2">traps isn&#39;t it the specialness to put</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.049" end="00:44:32.859" style="s2">there you go oh yeah I&#39;m special so poor</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.180" end="00:44:35.619" style="s2">you know you could say that that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.859" end="00:44:38.769" style="s2">that may be the meaning of life is just</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.619" end="00:44:40.390" style="s2">to meet it as artfully as possible then</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.769" end="00:44:43.480" style="s2">as you can and it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.390" end="00:44:45.640" style="s2">some specialized art work or art form or</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.480" end="00:44:48.519" style="s2">art yeah yeah I would agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.640" end="00:44:51.549" style="s2">you know and and part of like that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.519" end="00:44:54.869" style="s2">flipside of the danger part is you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.549" end="00:44:57.910" style="s2">that people don&#39;t want to hear or</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.869" end="00:45:01.420" style="s2">sometimes want to prohibit the the veil</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.910" end="00:45:04.539" style="s2">from being lifted and society at whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.420" end="00:45:08.109" style="s2">and so that they counter-attack to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.539" end="00:45:11.470" style="s2">is like oh well she&#39;s just a poet he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.109" end="00:45:14.289" style="s2">just a musician and and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.470" end="00:45:17.500" style="s2">they&#39;re a fool yeah he&#39;s so you you try</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.289" end="00:45:22.329" style="s2">to make them into into a clown or a fool</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.500" end="00:45:24.069" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a trick of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.329" end="00:45:27.849" style="s2">well we see it in politics all the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.069" end="00:45:30.609" style="s2">of authoritarian control it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.849" end="00:45:32.289" style="s2">first the first the first thing</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.520" end="00:49:38.359" style="s2">people&#39;s consciousness it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.290" end="00:49:39.740" style="s2">ultimate zombie or something right busy</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.530" end="00:49:52.609" style="s2">and at the same time there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.750" end="00:49:56.089" style="s2">altruistic compassionate act of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.609" end="00:49:59.869" style="s2">just getting somebody who you know falls</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.089" end="00:50:05.299" style="s2">on something that I wrote a place of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.869" end="00:50:08.329" style="s2">respite of quietude of reflection I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.299" end="00:50:13.790" style="s2">like okay no not not everybody is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.329" end="00:50:17.299" style="s2">this against us so the poem is an oasis</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.510" end="00:50:30.770" style="s2">although they are it&#39;s great it&#39;s a wee</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.790" end="00:50:32.809" style="s2">something that brings an individual back</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.770" end="00:50:33.619" style="s2">to the recognition of their own key</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.809" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">nominee</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.619" end="00:50:39.019" style="s2">and the inter connection and the inter</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.019" end="00:50:47.420" style="s2">that is important now more than ever</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.470" end="00:50:50.630" style="s2">because as we go through this crisis you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.420" end="00:50:52.579" style="s2">know you know it&#39;s cliche to say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.630" end="00:50:54.589" style="s2">either we all get through it together</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.579" end="00:51:02.809" style="s2">none of us do</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.589" end="00:51:05.059" style="s2">but it but it&#39;s true nonetheless no and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.809" end="00:51:07.819" style="s2">in any way you know regardless of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.059" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">you know then the bigger context it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.819" end="00:51:14.089" style="s2">about how do you want to live your life</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:18.680" style="s2">I mean you want a high present I want to</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.809" end="00:51:31.180" style="s2">tribulation relationship with others and</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.460" end="00:51:34.130" style="s2">and and and all all o being know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.180" end="00:51:37.579" style="s2">why why would you want to live in a in</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.130" end="00:51:45.049" style="s2">the separation by data mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.579" end="00:51:46.430" style="s2">I never missed a better what about well</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.049" end="00:51:49.640" style="s2">I kind of wanted eyes interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.430" end="00:51:55.309" style="s2">were saying that that that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.640" end="00:52:01.809" style="s2">get back to something like some more</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.309" end="00:52:01.809" style="s2">sane you know a community based society</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.019" end="00:52:07.249" style="s2">with genuine relationships rather than</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.670" end="00:52:10.430" style="s2">transactional ones etc and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.249" end="00:52:12.440" style="s2">talked about the prophetic aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.430" end="00:52:16.190" style="s2">poetry about seeing what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.440" end="00:52:17.809" style="s2">the future and you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.190" end="00:52:20.359" style="s2">thinking a lot about that what is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.809" end="00:52:25.190" style="s2">prophetic and the more I think about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.359" end="00:52:28.819" style="s2">the more I think that you know strong</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.190" end="00:52:33.230" style="s2">poetry has it as a prophetic aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.819" end="00:52:37.190" style="s2">it would you agree with that a if it</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.230" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">does it&#39;s it&#39;s like your book it seems</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.190" end="00:52:42.090" style="s2">to be somewhat prophetic at least and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:44.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.090" end="00:52:46.350" style="s2">because you keep saying this is left and</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.010" end="00:52:47.910" style="s2">you you describe the world to fragments</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.350" end="00:52:50.610" style="s2">right all this is what is enough but</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.910" end="00:52:52.290" style="s2">also the there&#39;s there&#39;s like an ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.610" end="00:52:54.060" style="s2">in a trauma happening at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.290" end="00:52:56.100" style="s2">as the trauma and ecstasy happening at</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.060" end="00:52:57.840" style="s2">the same time as you&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.100" end="00:53:01.110" style="s2">this landscape of all these neglected</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.840" end="00:53:04.140" style="s2">forgotten broken things of TS Eliot</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.110" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">wastelander or whatever whatever and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.140" end="00:53:08.430" style="s2">said at the same time embracing them</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:10.680" style="s2">more you know when I picked up your book</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.430" end="00:53:15.410" style="s2">and started reading it I had the sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.680" end="00:53:19.230" style="s2">that there was a prophetic quality to it</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.410" end="00:53:21.830" style="s2">yeah perhaps but you wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.230" end="00:53:24.000" style="s2">perhaps own that or</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.830" end="00:53:24.780" style="s2">what of what I would say is I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.000" end="00:53:27.570" style="s2">know it at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.780" end="00:53:31.140" style="s2">you know I sensed enter this is 2015</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.570" end="00:53:33.720" style="s2">yeah you know so I sensed that something</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.140" end="00:53:35.880" style="s2">was coming no you know said since that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.720" end="00:53:38.010" style="s2">book I&#39;ve done to others so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.880" end="00:53:41.310" style="s2">you know is that good is that predictive</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.010" end="00:53:45.300" style="s2">of time coming I don&#39;t know you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.310" end="00:53:47.670" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see but but I do I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.300" end="00:53:49.710" style="s2">know if I mean that predicting in turn</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.670" end="00:53:51.540" style="s2">okay know that I think that&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.710" end="00:53:54.210" style="s2">of a reductive idea of what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.540" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">prophetic okay uh-huh that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.210" end="00:54:03.570" style="s2">yeah prophetic you know there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:06.810" style="s2">sense of prophecy in that in and to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.570" end="00:54:11.130" style="s2">prophesy lands on intentionality and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.810" end="00:54:14.190" style="s2">if to the extent that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.130" end="00:54:18.930" style="s2">create a future we have to have some</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.190" end="00:54:23.480" style="s2">vision or intentionality of something to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.930" end="00:54:26.610" style="s2">come that we do we live into that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.480" end="00:54:29.820" style="s2">so so in that sense yes I would own that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.610" end="00:54:32.850" style="s2">the prophecy because that that part is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.820" end="00:54:35.940" style="s2">always aspirational it&#39;s like okay there</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.850" end="00:54:39.180" style="s2">there there&#39;s this current and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.940" end="00:54:41.970" style="s2">we can you could do but the prophetic is</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.180" end="00:54:45.240" style="s2">also coming to terms with the grief yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.970" end="00:54:48.030" style="s2">and the tragedy of this moment yes so we</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.240" end="00:54:49.980" style="s2">have to do this first yes before we get</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.030" end="00:54:54.150" style="s2">to what what what does that cause the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.980" end="00:54:54.680" style="s2">post tragic or the the next world or or</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.150" end="00:54:56.540" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.680" end="00:55:00.230" style="s2">world you know we&#39;re leaning into her</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.540" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">imagining or dreaming of right right</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.230" end="00:55:04.910" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:09.350" style="s2">you know it certainly and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.910" end="00:55:11.990" style="s2">really frustrating when when people when</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.350" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">I hear people saying well this moment is</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.990" end="00:55:17.660" style="s2">I&#39;m very grateful for and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:18.470" style="s2">gonna bring us to our senses and oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.660" end="00:55:21.770" style="s2">it&#39;s gruesome</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.470" end="00:55:24.020" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s a denial of of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.770" end="00:55:27.560" style="s2">grieving process a very deep breathing</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.020" end="00:55:29.540" style="s2">process that that has to be has to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.560" end="00:55:32.930" style="s2">experienced and I mean you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.540" end="00:55:34.340" style="s2">sugarcoat that at all I mean we they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.930" end="00:55:37.310" style="s2">probably the best thing everybody could</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.340" end="00:55:40.100" style="s2">do is that to go deeply into that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.310" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">sit with that that&#39;s that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.100" end="00:55:45.650" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna release the shadows of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:47.780" style="s2">even and and it comes almost like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.650" end="00:55:50.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no choice at this</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.780" end="00:55:52.820" style="s2">point it&#39;s not like a decision to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.120" end="00:55:55.070" style="s2">that right it&#39;s just it&#39;s just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.820" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s in our face right you me even if</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.070" end="00:56:02.090" style="s2">we&#39;re sitting watching Netflix 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:04.850" style="s2">a day we&#39;re still the truth of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.090" end="00:56:08.690" style="s2">happening the death all around us is</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.850" end="00:56:12.380" style="s2">going to have some you know effect on</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.690" end="00:56:15.800" style="s2">our consciousness certainly hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.380" end="00:56:19.370" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and and our own potential</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.800" end="00:56:24.350" style="s2">you know you know death right I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.370" end="00:56:26.510" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m only I&#39;m not quite 50 years old</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.350" end="00:56:28.850" style="s2">I have some gray hairs you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.510" end="00:56:31.580" style="s2">you know this this thing could take me</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.850" end="00:56:35.510" style="s2">out could take you out on a ways we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.580" end="00:56:36.920" style="s2">to think about that right and and and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.510" end="00:56:38.990" style="s2">don&#39;t want to think about that but we</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.920" end="00:56:40.250" style="s2">have no choice to think about that right</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.990" end="00:56:44.810" style="s2">now which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.250" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">yeah it is you know now I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.810" end="00:56:51.710" style="s2">you know at the beginning of this and</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:54.530" style="s2">wow like in January way before the block</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.710" end="00:56:59.420" style="s2">down I have friends in China so I saw</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.530" end="00:57:02.420" style="s2">tonight okay I saw was who&#39;s coming and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.420" end="00:57:05.690" style="s2">and also from you know my my scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.420" end="00:57:07.700" style="s2">background I knew severity that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.690" end="00:57:11.300" style="s2">likely to hit</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.700" end="00:57:14.450" style="s2">and and at the point of loves lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.300" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">here in France mid March is the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.450" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">realization that my parents are in their</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:22.369" style="s2">80s it&#39;s like I mean never seen them</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:26.030" style="s2">again and that&#39;s very real and and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.369" end="00:57:30.290" style="s2">allowed myself to to process really sad</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.030" end="00:57:35.150" style="s2">with that as a is a very real</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.290" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">possibility and and in and through that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.150" end="00:57:38.900" style="s2">process to extend it out to you to all</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:43.070" style="s2">of humanity that we&#39;re all going through</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.900" end="00:57:45.140" style="s2">this then you know so you not not make</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.070" end="00:57:46.310" style="s2">your heroic sense it&#39;s like oh okay well</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.140" end="00:57:51.579" style="s2">he&#39;s great good for him</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.310" end="00:57:55.160" style="s2">no it&#39;s that you know you look located</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.579" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">personally and and I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.160" end="00:58:01.460" style="s2">artistic sensibility is to to feel into</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.070" style="s2">what what&#39;s going on I said that a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.460" end="00:58:05.900" style="s2">species level yeah again and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.070" end="00:58:09.369" style="s2">another reason why maybe poetry is</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:11.660" style="s2">important right now because we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.369" end="00:58:16.130" style="s2">confronted with our own mortality</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.660" end="00:58:19.790" style="s2">yeah and what do we want to hear on our</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.130" end="00:58:22.250" style="s2">deathbed or you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.790" end="00:58:26.630" style="s2">care about our you know the you know our</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.250" end="00:58:29.569" style="s2">job or you know as much or a role or you</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.630" end="00:58:32.210" style="s2">know there are you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.569" end="00:58:35.780" style="s2">trying to achieve or that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.210" end="00:58:38.359" style="s2">we we need the essential the essentials</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.780" end="00:58:43.010" style="s2">right and a poetry is sort of aiming</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.359" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">towards the essentials I think yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.010" end="00:58:47.810" style="s2">also the play you know it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:49.819" style="s2">richness of life that we want that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.810" end="00:58:53.569" style="s2">need to that we contemplate much more</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.819" end="00:58:55.819" style="s2">deeply when we&#39;re faced with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.569" end="00:58:59.060" style="s2">possibility of deaths right yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.819" end="00:59:01.720" style="s2">certainly I mean you know existential</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.060" end="00:59:05.300" style="s2">crisis brings it brings it really close</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.720" end="00:59:09.290" style="s2">and and I&#39;m you know this this brings it</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.300" end="00:59:11.450" style="s2">home to everyone because it&#39;s like like</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.290" end="00:59:14.089" style="s2">you said yeah it could be literally</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.450" end="00:59:17.780" style="s2">brings it home yeah you could do me it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.089" end="00:59:21.320" style="s2">could be you um in in that sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.780" end="00:59:24.080" style="s2">immediacy brings people to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.320" end="00:59:26.450" style="s2">to to a different sort of sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.080" end="00:59:29.840" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like like climate</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.450" end="00:59:32.690" style="s2">you know good the climate crisis you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.840" end="00:59:35.150" style="s2">know it&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.690" end="00:59:38.600" style="s2">somebody to to experience that how much</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.150" end="00:59:40.070" style="s2">you&#39;re a farmer or a myelination where</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.600" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">you see it</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.070" end="00:59:46.130" style="s2">most people that doesn&#39;t affect and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:48.260" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get traction yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.130" end="00:59:50.690" style="s2">interesting but this thing is much more</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.260" end="00:59:53.120" style="s2">immediate amaze essential on an</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.690" end="00:59:55.340" style="s2">existential level then than any one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.120" end="00:59:57.260" style="s2">these other sort of hypothetical threats</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.340" end="01:00:00.920" style="s2">or idea that it even if they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.260" end="01:00:05.510" style="s2">they&#39;re just they don&#39;t the reason we</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.920" end="01:00:08.990" style="s2">don&#39;t change you know our habits to to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.510" end="01:00:11.510" style="s2">fix the climate is because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.990" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">really feel that it&#39;s a reality on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.510" end="01:00:16.760" style="s2">somatic level like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:20.540" style="s2">existential threat there right right</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.760" end="01:00:23.600" style="s2">right now right right always but but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.540" end="01:00:27.350" style="s2">but now here we have an existential</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.600" end="01:00:29.720" style="s2">threat that&#39;s happening right now on</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.350" end="01:00:31.460" style="s2">some level you know even if that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.720" end="01:00:33.800" style="s2">existential start is already there I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.460" end="01:00:37.190" style="s2">mean people die and there&#39;s tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.800" end="01:00:38.780" style="s2">happening all the time it&#39;s not like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.190" end="01:00:41.090" style="s2">know there&#39;s no there&#39;s a bit more of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.780" end="01:00:44.120" style="s2">happening right now but yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.090" end="01:00:47.870" style="s2">what I mean it yeah and in it it also it</p>

<p begin="01:01:01.490" end="01:01:05.360" style="s2">can send our trumpet out in Torah bar</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.410" end="01:01:09.410" style="s2">you know we can trumpet it out into the</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.740" end="01:01:23.690" style="s2">they I think the long-form discussion if</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">people have made it to this point in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.690" end="01:01:29.300" style="s2">conversation yeah and if there if</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:32.090" style="s2">there&#39;s that kind of engagement Oh</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.860" end="01:01:42.890" style="s2">conversation then then they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.210" end="01:01:44.510" style="s2">probably part of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.890" end="01:01:46.280" style="s2">the conversation is expanding and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.510" end="01:01:48.080" style="s2">deep conversation and that&#39;s a long-form</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.280" end="01:01:51.470" style="s2">conversation like it&#39;s like reading a</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.080" end="01:01:53.390" style="s2">book or or as opposed to just watching a</p>

<p begin="01:02:02.210" end="01:02:08.930" style="s2">very very important you know if they</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.530" end="01:02:12.110" style="s2">saved my sanity a lot you and you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.930" end="01:02:15.320" style="s2">in our little network of podcasters it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.110" end="01:02:17.540" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very very important and</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.320" end="01:02:20.900" style="s2">it&#39;s also it&#39;s also an important work</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.540" end="01:02:23.360" style="s2">it&#39;s well I&#39;m hoping it as you say I</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.900" end="01:02:25.190" style="s2">hope it is genuinely community building</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.360" end="01:02:27.800" style="s2">on some level I think it is I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.190" end="01:02:31.220" style="s2">very I think it&#39;s really generative um</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.800" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">you know in at this stage it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.220" end="01:02:35.330" style="s2">generative in the sense that these these</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:38.060" style="s2">different sorts of conversations are</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.330" end="01:02:43.190" style="s2">going out in the communities going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.060" end="01:02:45.620" style="s2">collect coalesce around around bits and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.190" end="01:02:48.290" style="s2">pieces of this I don&#39;t know how we all</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.620" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">come back together again and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.290" end="01:02:54.170" style="s2">going to do but certainly we know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:57.470" style="s2">we&#39;re not alone and that there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.170" end="01:03:01.970" style="s2">that we respect that are giving some</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.470" end="01:03:04.790" style="s2">deep thought and working on on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.970" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">situation that we find ourselves in and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.790" end="01:03:10.490" style="s2">in this this this goes from you know pre</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:12.260" style="s2">coronavirus right pre Cova time mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.490" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">mean it&#39;s really important it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.260" end="01:03:16.970" style="s2">does but this Kovan thing is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:18.980" style="s2">intensification and a deepening and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.970" end="01:03:21.410" style="s2">just really feels that way it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.980" end="01:03:23.200" style="s2">accelerator so I think it&#39;s an extremis</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.410" end="01:03:25.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s really accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.200" end="01:03:27.620" style="s2">whatever&#39;s happening positive negative</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.360" end="01:03:29.810" style="s2">yeah you know you don&#39;t have to even</p>

<p begin="01:03:29.810" end="01:03:35.430" style="s2">it&#39;s just deepening and acceleration</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.680" end="01:03:37.829" style="s2">over present</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.430" end="01:03:41.400" style="s2">individual sister or president you know</p>

<p begin="01:04:05.309" end="01:04:09.359" style="s2">publisher takes it and there it goes</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.900" end="01:04:11.880" style="s2">it&#39;s out in the world I have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:14.549" style="s2">I have no idea who&#39;s wears it where</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.880" end="01:04:16.740" style="s2">where it&#39;s landing if it&#39;s touching</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.549" end="01:04:19.740" style="s2">anybody or if it&#39;s yeah if it&#39;s landing</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.740" end="01:04:24.390" style="s2">nowhere I don&#39;t know but what I do know</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.740" end="01:04:27.450" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s taking part of the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.390" end="01:04:30.660" style="s2">the sphere of the poetry so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.450" end="01:04:33.720" style="s2">contributing then you know and maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.660" end="01:04:36.210" style="s2">future is going to look like something</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.720" end="01:04:39.529" style="s2">where where we can connect at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.210" end="01:04:44.960" style="s2">community level we have to rebuild</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.529" end="01:04:48.539" style="s2">smaller units and more more</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.960" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">earth-friendly resilient sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.539" end="01:04:53.160" style="s2">ways and at the same time we&#39;re like you</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:55.049" style="s2">like you say where we aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.160" end="01:04:57.869" style="s2">connect like this yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.049" end="01:04:59.999" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s both the local and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.869" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">global and whatever noticed in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.999" end="01:05:05.130" style="s2">conversation is that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:08.819" style="s2">blending into other conversations that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.130" end="01:05:10.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve had like there&#39;s a unity forming in</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.819" end="01:05:16.109" style="s2">all of these conversations so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.980" end="01:05:17.670" style="s2">just me talking to you it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.109" end="01:05:19.289" style="s2">speaking and then I&#39;m bringing in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.670" end="01:05:23.999" style="s2">other conversations that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.289" end="01:05:26.309" style="s2">having with people and so so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.999" end="01:05:29.910" style="s2">conversation is becoming larger and more</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.309" end="01:05:34.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s taking not not an absolute form</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.910" end="01:05:34.700" style="s2">but it&#39;s taking some kind of let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.789" end="01:05:38.700" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.940" end="01:05:41.670" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s taking this kind of</p>

<p begin="01:05:44.760" end="01:05:50.220" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.380" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">process of building itself of becoming</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.220" end="01:05:57.360" style="s2">of emerging and in we don&#39;t know I think</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.600" end="01:06:22.740" style="s2">know and we can control but that this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.330" end="01:06:26.280" style="s2">a reminder of the hubris of all that and</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.740" end="01:06:30.650" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s a call to to reconnect</p>
