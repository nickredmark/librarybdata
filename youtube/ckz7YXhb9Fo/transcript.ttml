<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">without anything personal just what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">going on over there in Toronto so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">doing well as all the people I love and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">care about including Chris and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">no in-person classes at the University</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:40.129" style="s2">of Toronto so I&#39;ve been switching</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">everything over to virtual the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.129" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">psychology department the department</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">physically closed on Friday my phottix</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">but the entire university will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">physically closed as a month beer</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">Tuesday I think they&#39;re trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">it open as long as possible for</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">libraries and whatnot but I expect that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">shortly because the premier has asked us</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">to go into pretty much lockdown so and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">the University of course being publicly</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">funded a university will follow what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">premier says so I fully expect that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">will be it when what&#39;s gonna happen I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know going forward I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">received one email indicating that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:24.290" style="s2">courses that I&#39;m supposed to teach in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.159" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">May and June</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.290" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">nothing official has been said but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">should plan for them to be done totally</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">virtually as well so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">happening sort of professionally and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">personally what&#39;s happening virtually is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a couple of talks with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">Hall around kovat 19 and issues around</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">it around rationality and faith and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">starting Monday I&#39;m going to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">live streaming free meditation course</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:19.720" style="s2">just meet regularly and sit together so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.580" end="00:02:22.240" style="s2">that&#39;s something I&#39;m gonna try and do to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.720" end="00:02:24.220" style="s2">help people out and Peter Lindbergh and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.240" end="00:02:26.230" style="s2">I are also putting together he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.220" end="00:02:28.900" style="s2">to revise some sort of a virtual stoah</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve got some of the most famous</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.900" end="00:02:34.240" style="s2">Stoics involved current Stoics I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">was not like we resurrected anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.240" end="00:02:40.780" style="s2">no Seneca Seneca will be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.150" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna be offering that for</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.780" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">people as a place where they can go also</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:50.590" style="s2">to well try to cultivate some in-person</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:53.170" style="s2">stoicism to give them a way of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.590" end="00:02:54.790" style="s2">with some of the extra strains that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.170" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">is putting on their lives so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.790" end="00:02:58.660" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of where I&#39;m at right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">hmm so how about you Christian is there</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.660" end="00:03:04.210" style="s2">anything you want to add to that no not</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:06.940" style="s2">really I&#39;m also fine my me and mine are</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.210" end="00:03:10.390" style="s2">fine so far um we&#39;ve been very fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.940" end="00:03:13.900" style="s2">I think comparably here next to much of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.390" end="00:03:15.550" style="s2">the rest of the world I think and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.900" end="00:03:17.800" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been off work for</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.550" end="00:03:19.420" style="s2">some months anyway so my day-to-day life</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.800" end="00:03:20.380" style="s2">hasn&#39;t changed a whole lot although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.420" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">learning that there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.380" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">between like elective solitude and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:26.709" style="s2">solitude by ordinance the activities on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:28.360" style="s2">the ground aren&#39;t all that different</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.709" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">that feeling is a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.360" end="00:03:32.260" style="s2">it has it&#39;s not quite an ordinance yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">here but it&#39;s that&#39;s just shy of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.260" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like we haven&#39;t been ordered to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:37.240" style="s2">remain cloistered in our homes but but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">everything is as John said everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.240" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">more or less shuttered so you really you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:43.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of options if you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">to venture out anyway but yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.720" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">say so far so good so far so good</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:52.420" style="s2">yeah how are you doing Andrew Oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:56.110" style="s2">something first I do person I were both</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.420" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">talking just before you came into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.110" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">room that we were actually very pleased</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">with how our both our federal and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.690" style="s2">provincial governments are handling this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">we&#39;re very happy about that and we think</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.690" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">they&#39;re doing an excellent job mmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:13.690" style="s2">that&#39;s good to know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">yeah about me personally well it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.690" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m an overworked</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:22.030" style="s2">underpaid teacher I would say so in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:27.500" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.030" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">months I&#39;ve been working crazily doing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.500" end="00:04:32.330" style="s2">lot of classes and also doing this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:34.780" style="s2">of thing so so I&#39;ve been overworked</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:39.169" style="s2">basically and a little bit burnt out and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.780" end="00:04:40.970" style="s2">so now I&#39;m on total lockdown I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.169" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">we&#39;ve been on total lockdown for about a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:48.590" style="s2">week here in France and luckily we moved</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:51.350" style="s2">last year to the edge of Paris so we</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.590" end="00:04:55.789" style="s2">have a little garden hmm so I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.350" end="00:04:58.789" style="s2">like I&#39;m very lucky compared to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.789" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">my friends and colleagues who are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.789" end="00:05:03.860" style="s2">in little apartments in Paris and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:05.389" style="s2">can&#39;t leave without a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.860" end="00:05:06.860" style="s2">basically you know they they need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.389" end="00:05:09.560" style="s2">have a piece of paper to say I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.860" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">to the store or I&#39;m going for a jog or</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.560" end="00:05:15.139" style="s2">something like that so it&#39;s very extreme</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:16.759" style="s2">here and it seems we&#39;re on the up curb</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.139" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s just getting worse in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.759" end="00:05:22.610" style="s2">numbers but so there&#39;s this extreme</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:24.530" style="s2">contrast between how wonderful my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.610" end="00:05:26.510" style="s2">is right now I&#39;m here with my family and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.530" end="00:05:29.599" style="s2">I&#39;m doing I&#39;m working remotely like like</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.510" end="00:05:31.970" style="s2">you John and I I&#39;m doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.599" end="00:05:34.039" style="s2">physical work every morning and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.970" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">feeling much healthier than I have in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.039" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">long time actually and the grim picture</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:44.449" style="s2">outside and my neighbor who&#39;s elderly</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:47.389" style="s2">and just had a stroke and it&#39;s very odd</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.449" end="00:05:49.400" style="s2">he can&#39;t really we&#39;re not supposed to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.389" end="00:05:53.240" style="s2">and talk to her and so well usually we</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.400" end="00:05:55.099" style="s2">have a relationship so so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.240" end="00:05:58.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very extreme contrast</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.099" end="00:06:00.320" style="s2">between me right now feeling like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.430" end="00:06:01.970" style="s2">living my life like I would want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.320" end="00:06:05.150" style="s2">living white life really almost in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.970" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">retreat like a Buddhist retreat with my</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.150" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">family and and then the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:16.009" style="s2">situation outside you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:17.900" style="s2">Andrew I just and I&#39;m just this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.009" end="00:06:19.220" style="s2">practical curiosity but I&#39;ve heard of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.900" end="00:06:21.080" style="s2">that I&#39;ve heard I know this is true</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.220" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">Italy I didn&#39;t know that it was also</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.080" end="00:06:25.009" style="s2">true of France that you need some kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:26.330" style="s2">of you need effectively a permission</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.009" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">slip to go out and carry on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.330" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">business what what does that mean like</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">where do you get that is you you find it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">on the internet and you have to print it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">out and it has to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:40.190" style="s2">date on it so we&#39;ve had our groceries</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">delivered so I haven&#39;t even gone out and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.190" end="00:06:45.289" style="s2">done that yet actually but but so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.550" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">guess you you can change the date each</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.289" end="00:06:49.340" style="s2">time you go go out and you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:52.009" style="s2">why you&#39;re going out if you&#39;re going out</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.340" end="00:06:54.190" style="s2">to walk the dog or go for a jog you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.009" end="00:06:56.599" style="s2">to be six meters away from other people</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.190" end="00:06:58.220" style="s2">six meters something is something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.599" end="00:06:59.780" style="s2">that maybe I&#39;ve got that wrong I could I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.220" end="00:07:01.460" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have a but but you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.780" end="00:07:03.470" style="s2">to really keep a distance from everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.460" end="00:07:05.270" style="s2">I&#39;m not allowed to go out with my family</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.470" end="00:07:09.500" style="s2">for a lot for example I can go it alone</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.270" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">I could go for a jog and I could do</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.500" end="00:07:15.860" style="s2">exercise or go for a walk but but but</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:20.509" style="s2">again I&#39;m in a little village so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.860" end="00:07:22.220" style="s2">in the heat of the the the the heat of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.509" end="00:07:24.380" style="s2">the thing which a lot of my friends in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.220" end="00:07:26.569" style="s2">Paris are and I can kind of I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.380" end="00:07:29.650" style="s2">that from them that it&#39;s very intense I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.569" end="00:07:33.050" style="s2">think being stuck in a small apartment</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.650" end="00:07:35.780" style="s2">would be would be pretty hard yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.050" end="00:07:39.409" style="s2">know so I read your papers your paper</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.780" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">today much too quickly i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.409" end="00:07:44.930" style="s2">going to reread it in more more detail</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.780" style="s2">here is called gnosis in the second</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.930" end="00:07:50.210" style="s2">person responding to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.780" end="00:07:54.889" style="s2">in the Socratic quest of authentic</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.210" end="00:08:00.889" style="s2">dialogue so what struck me in the end is</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.889" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">is and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong if</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.889" end="00:08:07.819" style="s2">I&#39;ve misunderstood something because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">this is a big overview so this is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.819" end="00:08:16.940" style="s2">dialo goes right and you outline sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:20.300" style="s2">five dimensions of dialogue owes and one</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.940" end="00:08:22.310" style="s2">is the let&#39;s say person to person which</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.300" end="00:08:26.539" style="s2">is the horizontal dimension of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.310" end="00:08:28.849" style="s2">us me talking to you and then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.539" end="00:08:32.029" style="s2">vertical dimension which is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.849" end="00:08:34.360" style="s2">talking to to being about questioning</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.029" end="00:08:38.450" style="s2">yourself and/or your existence I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.360" end="00:08:40.060" style="s2">or being itself and then you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.450" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">how that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.060" end="00:08:45.130" style="s2">but that moves into something a third</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:47.650" style="s2">dimension which is related to the eye</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.130" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">maybe the eye though in some level that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.650" end="00:08:53.650" style="s2">something is created out of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">dialogue hmm right and I and and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.650" end="00:08:58.780" style="s2">the fourth dimension is that moves into</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.170" end="00:09:02.200" style="s2">time and then the fifth dimension is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.780" end="00:09:04.810" style="s2">kind of timelessness that results and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.200" end="00:09:06.310" style="s2">so I like this whole model I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.810" end="00:09:08.530" style="s2">very very beautiful and I wondered if</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.310" end="00:09:13.090" style="s2">you could just go into detail and flush</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.530" end="00:09:14.500" style="s2">it out a bit so I&#39;ll uh I&#39;ll start Chris</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.090" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">and I will probably tag-team a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.500" end="00:09:21.640" style="s2">because our thinking on this paper is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:23.620" style="s2">deeply symbiotic I think one thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.640" end="00:09:25.270" style="s2">perhaps it would be useful to keep a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.620" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">distinction in hand that we could refer</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.270" end="00:09:29.850" style="s2">to throughout which is dialogo cesare</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.490" end="00:09:33.580" style="s2">the process that&#39;s being realized and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.850" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">dialectic is the psycho technology that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.580" end="00:09:38.920" style="s2">people can learn and practice in order</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">to try and realize the process and try</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.920" end="00:09:43.780" style="s2">to cause it to be instantiated in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:45.880" style="s2">dialogue and so part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.780" end="00:09:49.740" style="s2">trying to do in the paper is to figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.880" end="00:09:52.680" style="s2">out as you mentioned the the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.740" end="00:09:56.950" style="s2">both phenomenological and functional of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:10:00.610" style="s2">d logos as a process and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.950" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">starting to that of course has merit in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.610" end="00:10:04.270" style="s2">its own right we&#39;re also doing that also</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:05.800" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to figure out from</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.270" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">the phenomenology and the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.800" end="00:10:10.780" style="s2">what the psycho technology should look</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">like what should dialectic look like</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.780" end="00:10:14.470" style="s2">what are some of the features that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:17.140" style="s2">should be put into practice and the hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.470" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">is the oral hope from the paper is if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.140" end="00:10:21.970" style="s2">can work back from the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.180" end="00:10:25.690" style="s2">functionality of do logos into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.970" end="00:10:28.090" style="s2">reverse engineering the dialectic we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:30.490" style="s2">put that potentially into a deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.090" end="00:10:32.950" style="s2">dialogue and I choose that term</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:36.130" style="s2">intentionally a deep dialogue with what</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.950" end="00:10:37.780" style="s2">we see in Socratic practice within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.130" end="00:10:43.780" style="s2">Platonic dialogues and the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.780" end="00:10:46.830" style="s2">traditions as a way of then putting all</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.780" end="00:10:49.330" style="s2">of that into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.830" end="00:10:51.820" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.330" end="00:10:57.850" style="s2">emergence of both psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.820" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">like guys and stocks circling or you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.850" end="00:11:02.520" style="s2">know Atwood Russia&#39;s empathy circling or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:06.280" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.520" end="00:11:09.160" style="s2">anti debate these new practices and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.280" end="00:11:10.750" style="s2">their attempts to tap into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.160" end="00:11:11.980" style="s2">collective intelligence of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.750" end="00:11:14.830" style="s2">cognition and so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.980" end="00:11:17.260" style="s2">reverse-engineer dialectic put it into</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.830" end="00:11:19.570" style="s2">contact with the historical scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.260" end="00:11:21.670" style="s2">of platonic dialectic take that whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.570" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">thing and put it into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.670" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">these emerging practices in which people</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">are seeking to reformulate Andry vivify</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:33.910" style="s2">dialogue so that it can be a means by</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:37.330" style="s2">which people can cultivate wisdom in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.910" end="00:11:43.840" style="s2">deep sense then we think what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.330" end="00:11:46.390" style="s2">is help to bring philosophy a--</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.840" end="00:11:49.390" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom into these</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.390" end="00:11:51.460" style="s2">emerging practices because I generally</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.390" end="00:11:53.500" style="s2">see although I have great value and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.460" end="00:11:55.330" style="s2">appreciation and I participate in these</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.500" end="00:11:58.780" style="s2">practices I&#39;m not just an outsider of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.330" end="00:12:01.150" style="s2">great value and appreciation for things</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.780" end="00:12:03.430" style="s2">like circling and I&#39;m in constant</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.150" end="00:12:06.730" style="s2">communication with guys hens Don and guy</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.430" end="00:12:08.590" style="s2">actually sanctions this and in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.730" end="00:12:11.020" style="s2">positive sense on what I&#39;m about to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.590" end="00:12:14.080" style="s2">I see these practices as largely lacking</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.020" end="00:12:15.940" style="s2">the integration with philosophy ax and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.080" end="00:12:17.710" style="s2">that maybe means if can i interject a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.940" end="00:12:20.590" style="s2">little bit of lacking in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.710" end="00:12:22.900" style="s2">lacking in a Nigerian yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.590" end="00:12:26.110" style="s2">you&#39;re in when we what Heidegger means</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.900" end="00:12:27.700" style="s2">by thinking this is almost taboo in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.110" end="00:12:29.850" style="s2">these kind of circles we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.700" end="00:12:33.820" style="s2">have a we&#39;re supposed to work on our</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.850" end="00:12:37.870" style="s2">feeling somatic experiences and then on</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.820" end="00:12:41.050" style="s2">the other hand so there&#39;s this divide</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.870" end="00:12:43.390" style="s2">between the somatic experience and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.050" end="00:12:46.630" style="s2">divided you semantically magnetism</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.390" end="00:12:49.270" style="s2">yeah intellectualization and extreme</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.630" end="00:12:50.860" style="s2">sort of empiricism on one hand and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.270" end="00:12:53.170" style="s2">extreme sort of experience on the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.860" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">am i Gary much very much I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.170" end="00:12:57.250" style="s2">right I think there&#39;s kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.250" end="00:13:02.330" style="s2">intellectualism</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.220" end="00:13:04.770" style="s2">that&#39;s often the presentation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.330" end="00:13:06.270" style="s2">propositional argumentation or there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.770" end="00:13:08.640" style="s2">sort of that like I call it the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.270" end="00:13:11.610" style="s2">romantic romantic ISM where somehow by</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.640" end="00:13:17.190" style="s2">sort of exploring our somatic states we</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">will accrue to the good life that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.190" end="00:13:19.950" style="s2">to say that there isn&#39;t a lot of value</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">in mindfulness in at reception</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.950" end="00:13:28.050" style="s2">you know I hold to all of that but I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">agree what&#39;s missing and I think you put</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.050" end="00:13:31.590" style="s2">your finger on it well in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.710" style="s2">practices where we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.590" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">communicate and even commune if by that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.710" end="00:13:39.690" style="s2">we mean that the connectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">intimacy between people is also valued</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.690" end="00:13:44.580" style="s2">what&#39;s missing and all in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:47.190" style="s2">practices is like I said is but how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.580" end="00:13:49.020" style="s2">they how do they help us cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.190" end="00:13:51.750" style="s2">wisdom both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.020" end="00:13:53.370" style="s2">collectively in a way that&#39;s seriously</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.750" end="00:13:58.050" style="s2">needed for addressing the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.370" end="00:13:59.400" style="s2">now let Chris speak well that was pretty</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.640" end="00:14:19.170" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;ve invoked the Socratic</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.810" end="00:14:43.950" style="s2">that yeah yeah um so I mean the reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.460" end="00:14:45.960" style="s2">that Socrates is such a choice symbol or</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.950" end="00:14:49.170" style="s2">symbol on for us is precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.960" end="00:14:52.080" style="s2">the Socratic dialogue goes combines the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.170" end="00:14:54.030" style="s2">dramaturgical dimensions of in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.060" end="00:15:01.320" style="s2">right the dimension of it that&#39;s played</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.070" end="00:15:03.210" style="s2">through and dramatized and enacted and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.320" end="00:15:08.310" style="s2">then the dimension of it that then</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.210" end="00:15:10.860" style="s2">regather zazz as a as a process of of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.310" end="00:15:12.780" style="s2">will be Maiko reasoning or rationing</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.860" end="00:15:17.160" style="s2">right and so because because</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.780" end="00:15:18.900" style="s2">Socrates as a symbol is both a entreats</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.160" end="00:15:21.390" style="s2">us to both at once he entreats us both</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.900" end="00:15:23.430" style="s2">to the to the the discourse for the</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:30.060" style="s2">those two are then bundled in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.170" end="00:15:32.550" style="s2">process of dialogo stripe because you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.060" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">have what we called or what right called</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.460" end="00:15:47.850" style="s2">process you have the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.870" end="00:15:49.770" style="s2">disclosure the thing that seems to avail</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.850" end="00:15:52.470" style="s2">more of reality and that they&#39;re bundled</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.770" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2">together and Socrates because of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.470" end="00:15:57.000" style="s2">nature of the symbol because of his</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:58.530" style="s2">countenance he tends to provoke both of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.000" end="00:16:00.780" style="s2">those states at once because Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.530" end="00:16:03.390" style="s2">sort of stands Socrates is both a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.780" end="00:16:05.280" style="s2">personal and impersonal mystery right</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.390" end="00:16:07.500" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know who that somehow who</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.280" end="00:16:09.030" style="s2">knowing who Socrates is isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.500" end="00:16:10.980" style="s2">knowing who Socrates is it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.030" end="00:16:12.420" style="s2">knowing who we are and knowing who we</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.980" end="00:16:15.840" style="s2">are isn&#39;t just knowing who we are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.420" end="00:16:17.760" style="s2">knowing what what what the world is writ</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.840" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">large and all of these things seem to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.760" end="00:16:20.640" style="s2">constantly together in this cretak</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:22.020" style="s2">symbol and that&#39;s why he&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.640" end="00:16:25.800" style="s2">prism through which all of this then</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.020" end="00:16:27.990" style="s2">opens so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve dropped him I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.800" end="00:16:29.730" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not exactly an ingenious move</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.990" end="00:16:32.190" style="s2">Socrates has been this for a long long</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.730" end="00:16:34.080" style="s2">time too many people we&#39;ve dropped him</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.190" end="00:16:36.210" style="s2">into the middle of this because he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.080" end="00:16:38.670" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s an emissary and an exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.210" end="00:16:43.110" style="s2">for it at same time right so he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:45.980" style="s2">bridge and he&#39;s sort of a bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.110" end="00:16:48.060" style="s2">the per the personal and the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.980" end="00:16:49.980" style="s2">going back and forth and he also</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.060" end="00:16:52.770" style="s2">transcends both the personal and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.980" end="00:16:55.500" style="s2">impersonal well he famously famously</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.770" end="00:16:57.540" style="s2">presents himself as a tip-offs not</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.500" end="00:17:00.330" style="s2">belonging to any category and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.540" end="00:17:04.860" style="s2">Mattacks who somehow between the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.330" end="00:17:08.420" style="s2">and the divine and so he he consciously</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.860" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">or at least through in plato&#39;s dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.420" end="00:17:15.510" style="s2">identifies with those two those two you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:16.950" style="s2">know buying the symbol long</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.510" end="00:17:21.330" style="s2">relationships you have the binding</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.950" end="00:17:24.180" style="s2">together he sort of sits between our</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.330" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">normal categories of identity for human</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.180" end="00:17:26.520" style="s2">beings and as i said he sits between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.040" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.520" end="00:17:30.780" style="s2">devine and therefore he can bind both of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">those together a rock cows can his</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.780" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">really good book Heidegger&#39;s platonism</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:39.150" style="s2">talks about why Socrates in the dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:40.680" style="s2">form are actually inseparable this goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.150" end="00:17:44.850" style="s2">back to Ashley R mocker and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.680" end="00:17:48.120" style="s2">Slagle from the presentation of what of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.850" end="00:17:50.960" style="s2">Plato&#39;s view of of the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.120" end="00:17:53.880" style="s2">wisdom and the basic the basic idea is</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:55.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s it I think it actually comports</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.880" end="00:17:56.760" style="s2">a very well conversion with the argument</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.470" end="00:18:00.510" style="s2">that Chris and I are making but trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.760" end="00:18:01.980" style="s2">to get dialogue activating and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.510" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">integrating all the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.980" end="00:18:07.140" style="s2">knowing in that what we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:10.410" style="s2">dialogue you need some you need three</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.140" end="00:18:13.560" style="s2">things you need argumentation obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.410" end="00:18:15.300" style="s2">mm-hmm in order to do as Chris said</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.560" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">provoke those kinds of profound insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.300" end="00:18:18.870" style="s2">it has to be a kind of an argument ation</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.150" style="s2">directed towards the affordance of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.870" end="00:18:23.250" style="s2">aporia right that that way you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.150" end="00:18:24.900" style="s2">forced to step back and wonder in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.250" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">profound way to call yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.900" end="00:18:29.070" style="s2">question and think about Heidegger we</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">are the beings whose aporia is means a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.070" end="00:18:35.790" style="s2">sort of a state of unknown entity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:38.570" style="s2">that&#39;s like a net right yeah deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.790" end="00:18:40.770" style="s2">perplexity and an epidemic precipice</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.570" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2">okay so he pushes you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.770" end="00:18:45.240" style="s2">towards the precipice and then you stand</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:46.620" style="s2">back and you experience wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:48.510" style="s2">everything comes into question and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.620" end="00:18:50.760" style="s2">therefore you you you actually identify</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.510" end="00:18:54.090" style="s2">with what Heidegger would call design</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.760" end="00:18:55.950" style="s2">you identify with that aspect that seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.090" end="00:18:57.330" style="s2">to be central to human beings how we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.950" end="00:18:59.610" style="s2">the beings whose beings are in question</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.330" end="00:19:02.460" style="s2">and that gives us a privileged kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.610" end="00:19:05.160" style="s2">access in our being not enough not in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.460" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">our self or oh yeah but a nurse analogy</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.160" end="00:19:11.220" style="s2">but but beyond that not yeah not just in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:12.270" style="s2">our propositional thoughts but in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.220" end="00:19:14.760" style="s2">that deeper kind of thing we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.270" end="00:19:16.440" style="s2">about earlier the thinking and so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.760" end="00:19:19.770" style="s2">of course it is centrally or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.440" end="00:19:20.910" style="s2">argumentation but you but what you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.770" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have just a competition of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.910" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">arguments right in the dialogue you also</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.540" style="s2">the competition of ways of life Seifer</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:29.730" style="s2">do you have to represent a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.540" end="00:19:31.500" style="s2">he represents the unexamined life that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.730" end="00:19:34.380" style="s2">is right sorry the examined life is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.500" end="00:19:36.540" style="s2">living in competition so you&#39;re not only</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.380" end="00:19:40.110" style="s2">having arguments in competition you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.540" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">to see ways of life in competition</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.110" end="00:19:44.790" style="s2">with each other and I think yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">continue your thought you let I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.790" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">well make the third point and you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:50.030" style="s2">choose how you wish to respond and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:52.380" style="s2">Socrates exemplifies the competition</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.030" end="00:19:53.940" style="s2">between arguments that is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.380" end="00:19:56.910" style="s2">induce wonder in the insight that Chris</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.940" end="00:19:59.040" style="s2">mentioned he&#39;s supposed to he you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.910" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">do this with argumentation you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.040" end="00:20:02.760" style="s2">in order to represent the competition</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.610" style="s2">between late ways of life you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.760" end="00:20:07.950" style="s2">rely on drama that&#39;s so the does be</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.610" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">embodied and yeah you have to have that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.950" end="00:20:11.880" style="s2">right so how are you gonna get argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.070" style="s2">and drama together you need dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.880" end="00:20:17.010" style="s2">then the next thing you need right is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.070" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">you need you need Socrates represents</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.010" end="00:20:21.210" style="s2">aspiration he represents our</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:23.040" style="s2">relationship to our sacred second self</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.210" end="00:20:27.350" style="s2">he represents a call to transformation</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.350" end="00:20:32.760" style="s2">to any that&#39;s another reason why has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.059" end="00:20:35.010" style="s2">be symbolic for us that call to self</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.760" end="00:20:37.650" style="s2">transcendence right that&#39;s there has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.010" end="00:20:41.400" style="s2">be you you need a form of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.650" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s inherently woven with symbol it</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.400" end="00:20:47.040" style="s2">has to it has to both reach you where</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.900" style="s2">you are but draw you beyond where you</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.900" end="00:20:53.910" style="s2">to be the Midwife for you and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.870" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">dialogue is also the way in which you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.910" end="00:20:58.350" style="s2">represent that aspirational relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:01.049" style="s2">right it&#39;s in the back and forth between</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.350" end="00:21:03.210" style="s2">you the interlocutors and Socrates that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.049" end="00:21:05.340" style="s2">you can see the aspirational movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.210" end="00:21:08.190" style="s2">taking place the dial up think that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.340" end="00:21:09.870" style="s2">fact that the dialogues are like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.190" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">non completable they&#39;re open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.870" end="00:21:15.059" style="s2">they&#39;re often emergent is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:18.809" style="s2">required for representing what Plato is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.059" end="00:21:20.190" style="s2">trying to talk about so the so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.809" end="00:21:24.390" style="s2">trying to say there&#39;s these three deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.190" end="00:21:27.059" style="s2">ways in which Socrates exemplifies the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.390" end="00:21:30.929" style="s2">necessity of dialogue for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.059" end="00:21:34.770" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom hmm okay you were</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.929" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">talking about the examined life in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.770" end="00:21:42.150" style="s2">unexamined life okay yes and so as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:44.900" style="s2">were saying that what came to me right</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.150" end="00:21:47.460" style="s2">now is the event that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.900" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">experiencing which seems to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.460" end="00:21:51.419" style="s2">background of all of our discussions</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:55.799" style="s2">even if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.419" end="00:21:57.169" style="s2">you know philosophical high abstract</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.799" end="00:22:01.799" style="s2">philosophical things Oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.169" end="00:22:03.779" style="s2">and so so I want I want I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.799" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">somehow make a bridge to what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.779" end="00:22:10.469" style="s2">in the world right now and and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:15.179" style="s2">examined life and and what that means in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.469" end="00:22:16.579" style="s2">the face of this extraordinary thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.179" end="00:22:20.489" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.579" end="00:22:24.299" style="s2">coronavirus or whatever and how this can</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.489" end="00:22:25.950" style="s2">and also how this can help us in terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.299" end="00:22:27.959" style="s2">of this dialogue oh so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.950" end="00:22:30.419" style="s2">making life more meaning through</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.959" end="00:22:33.959" style="s2">dialogue goes how can we relate that to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.419" end="00:22:36.450" style="s2">our actual experience right now you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.959" end="00:22:39.539" style="s2">you have anything to say well I do I</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.450" end="00:22:41.669" style="s2">want to give I want to relate a quick</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.539" end="00:22:43.349" style="s2">story and it will directly concerns</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.669" end="00:22:46.440" style="s2">Chris and that way I can segue to Chris</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.349" end="00:22:47.579" style="s2">yes I wondering what he was just because</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.440" end="00:22:49.259" style="s2">Chris and I have been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.579" end="00:22:51.809" style="s2">at length and I want I want him to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.259" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">over a little bit on this but I had</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.809" end="00:22:56.579" style="s2">another meeting with online virtual</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.229" style="s2">meeting somebody was interviewing me</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.579" end="00:23:01.969" style="s2">about the meeting crisis and we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.229" end="00:23:05.009" style="s2">talking and we were talking at one point</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.969" end="00:23:06.719" style="s2">and I said I want to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.009" end="00:23:09.079" style="s2">with the language and he said and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.719" end="00:23:12.450" style="s2">picked up on that knee and he&#39;s like any</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.079" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">know that he really liked that and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.450" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">then he and then I said you know you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.690" end="00:23:22.049" style="s2">know and then I pointed to Chris and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:25.700" style="s2">Chris&#39;s gift his great gift for being</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.049" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">both you know capable of a precision of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.700" end="00:23:30.119" style="s2">expression that is at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">beautiful and beauty is one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.119" end="00:23:35.249" style="s2">in which we aspire right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:37.649" style="s2">platonic idea and then you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.249" end="00:23:38.909" style="s2">pointed to Kristin but that because</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.649" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">they&#39;re stripped I was trying to say how</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.909" end="00:23:44.759" style="s2">that precision and beautification of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:47.609" style="s2">thought is so needed and he had this</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.759" end="00:23:49.769" style="s2">response spontaneous and beautiful he</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.609" end="00:23:51.809" style="s2">said of course I would he said this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.769" end="00:23:54.479" style="s2">literally he said I would rather die</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.809" end="00:23:57.379" style="s2">than not talk like that and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.479" end="00:24:00.479" style="s2">this example because it&#39;s very pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.379" end="00:24:03.749" style="s2">in the middle of this crisis and he says</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.479" end="00:24:05.140" style="s2">to me right he says it very since earth</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.749" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">I&#39;d rather die than not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.140" end="00:24:10.300" style="s2">to talk that way and then I said to him</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:12.580" style="s2">that&#39;s you I said you know you&#39;ve said a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.300" end="00:24:14.170" style="s2">lot but that&#39;s the Socratic moment for</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.580" end="00:24:16.540" style="s2">me that&#39;s we that&#39;s where you get it not</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.170" end="00:24:18.820" style="s2">in thought but you get it in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.540" end="00:24:21.310" style="s2">like you&#39;re being right that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.820" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.310" end="00:24:26.140" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:28.180" style="s2">know and notice that the context the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.140" end="00:24:30.490" style="s2">language he used and the context in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.180" end="00:24:33.040" style="s2">which Socrates offered that Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.490" end="00:24:36.430" style="s2">facing death the person that I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.040" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">talking to he is you know he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.430" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">facing the situation you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:43.900" style="s2">Andrew and that&#39;s that comes out from</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">him naturally and spontaneously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.900" end="00:24:48.760" style="s2">right and so they&#39;re there there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:51.310" style="s2">obviously you know there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.760" end="00:24:53.410" style="s2">which we&#39;re jumping up and down Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.310" end="00:24:56.140" style="s2">hierarchy of needs right now and people</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.410" end="00:24:58.510" style="s2">have to take care of their survival but</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.140" end="00:25:02.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a point at which right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.510" end="00:25:06.180" style="s2">point at which people also need a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.610" end="00:25:09.130" style="s2">meaning to a difficult difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.180" end="00:25:10.930" style="s2">situation in fact in the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:13.750" style="s2">of situations the most threatening of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.930" end="00:25:17.110" style="s2">situations they are willing to put mere</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.750" end="00:25:20.260" style="s2">survival at risk in order to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.110" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">maintain an examined and meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.260" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">beyond as I said Chris came readily to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:29.530" style="s2">my mind about that deep connection and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:33.940" style="s2">readily to my lips about that deep</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.530" end="00:25:35.860" style="s2">connection between the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.940" end="00:25:40.420" style="s2">making meaning and that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.860" end="00:25:46.390" style="s2">revivify and you know empower the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.420" end="00:25:49.180" style="s2">entirety of one&#39;s psyche yeah please</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.390" end="00:25:50.800" style="s2">speak to that Chris because I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.180" end="00:25:52.660" style="s2">that&#39;s my experience of both you guys</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.800" end="00:25:56.430" style="s2">actually and that&#39;s why I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.660" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">to you I think you both have that drive</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.430" end="00:26:05.130" style="s2">thatthat kind of almost monomania which</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:05.130" style="s2">which which wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.120" end="00:26:12.840" style="s2">couldn&#39;t bear on some level to be living</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.120" end="00:26:16.360" style="s2">a life that wasn&#39;t that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.840" end="00:26:19.010" style="s2">authenticity but also a kind of striving</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.360" end="00:26:20.660" style="s2">towards beauty at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.010" end="00:26:24.230" style="s2">sorry to keep talking crisp please say</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.660" end="00:26:26.679" style="s2">something yeah well I&#39;m kind of hot at</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.230" end="00:26:29.690" style="s2">the collar thank you John and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.679" end="00:26:32.330" style="s2">it&#39;s tit I don&#39;t feel equals those</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.690" end="00:26:34.549" style="s2">estimations so maybe I&#39;ll just glide</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.330" end="00:26:40.610" style="s2">over them I&#39;m touched by it I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.549" end="00:26:43.040" style="s2">know what to say to it I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.610" end="00:26:44.980" style="s2">think there are some interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.040" end="00:26:47.960" style="s2">happening that I&#39;ve been noticing both</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.980" end="00:26:51.950" style="s2">personally and then in personally I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.960" end="00:26:55.460" style="s2">telling John that I had I had a strange</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.950" end="00:26:59.330" style="s2">episode maybe a week ago or so there I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.460" end="00:27:01.429" style="s2">felt there&#39;s really no other way to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.330" end="00:27:05.690" style="s2">it I just sort of felt the gulf open up</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.429" end="00:27:07.429" style="s2">beneath me and the sense of futility and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.690" end="00:27:09.559" style="s2">I and I mean I&#39;m a damn it this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.429" end="00:27:11.230" style="s2">attribution I think at the time I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.559" end="00:27:14.660" style="s2">what I think now was a midget</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.230" end="00:27:18.380" style="s2">misattribution of any number of personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.660" end="00:27:20.059" style="s2">failings or personal doubts and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.380" end="00:27:22.010" style="s2">what it actually was is it had something</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.059" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">more to do with the super personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.010" end="00:27:26.299" style="s2">nature of what&#39;s going on right now but</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:28.700" style="s2">I was effectively enclosed by feelings</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.299" end="00:27:30.980" style="s2">of futility that were tera lytic like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.700" end="00:27:33.169" style="s2">torpor just something that I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.980" end="00:27:38.150" style="s2">move from I remember what I went up</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.169" end="00:27:39.710" style="s2">three hours on a three-hour walk just to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.150" end="00:27:41.419" style="s2">try and shake it off and didn&#39;t manage</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.419" end="00:27:45.799" style="s2">a couple of days and then slowly over</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.880" end="00:27:48.290" style="s2">time it unwound enough for me to regain</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.799" end="00:27:51.860" style="s2">some ability and to get back into</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.290" end="00:27:53.630" style="s2">activity but I was puzzled by that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.860" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">because I never I never I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.630" end="00:27:58.910" style="s2">experienced something that I found such</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.780" end="00:28:14.150" style="s2">of virulence in general and because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:16.160" style="s2">that virulence is such an easy host for</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.150" end="00:28:19.850" style="s2">meaninglessness just as the BIOS is host</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.160" end="00:28:21.290" style="s2">for a virus right it MX the analogy of</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.380" end="00:28:50.150" style="s2">might hope so that with the ebbing of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.260" end="00:28:52.820" style="s2">certainty comes a renewed interest in</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.210" end="00:29:19.880" style="s2">happens enough for us to take notice</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.930" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">it&#39;s as the at like it&#39;s as though we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.740" end="00:31:23.690" style="s2">is it could be the opportunity for</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.650" end="00:31:44.780" style="s2">this settles down who knows but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.450" end="00:31:46.850" style="s2">the way I feel at the moment hmm well I</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.780" end="00:31:50.120" style="s2">was just talking with my wife at dinner</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.850" end="00:31:55.250" style="s2">time and we were talking about all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.120" end="00:31:57.560" style="s2">the institutions that have are sort of</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.560" end="00:32:05.270" style="s2">mean school medicine you know government</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.360" end="00:32:09.590" style="s2">the hole the hole all of the structures</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.520" end="00:32:28.070" style="s2">which just is it&#39;s a remarkable moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.980" end="00:32:29.810" style="s2">in that sense another thing that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.070" end="00:32:32.090" style="s2">called into question is when this is</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:22.570" style="s2">what gets revealed is the stuff that</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.690" end="00:35:29.770" style="s2">questioning are the things that they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.220" end="00:35:31.690" style="s2">retreating to almost like the way you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:39.970" style="s2">right they&#39;re taking refuge in those</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.980" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">practices and those those people that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.970" end="00:35:44.950" style="s2">give them you know the senses of</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.970" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">cop right because police have lives that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.240" end="00:36:18.520" style="s2">are 90 percent boredom shot through with</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">ten percent terror and so most of us are</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">facing that right now you know many</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:23.950" style="s2">people are talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:24.910" style="s2">they&#39;re shut inside and they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.950" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">what they&#39;re gonna do with themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.910" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2">and on one hand they&#39;re facing this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:30.910" style="s2">tremendous kind of boredom and then but</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">then of course every now and then they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.910" end="00:36:35.020" style="s2">lift their eyes towards the window and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">they&#39;re filled with a kind of terror and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.020" end="00:36:44.290" style="s2">the thing that modifies both of those</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:46.030" style="s2">that enhances your capacity to find well</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.290" end="00:36:48.130" style="s2">meaning in the face of boredom because</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:51.370" style="s2">mortal boredom is sort of a mini meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.130" end="00:36:54.790" style="s2">crisis right and and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.370" end="00:36:57.220" style="s2">allows you to confront terror with</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.790" end="00:37:00.550" style="s2">courage is is precisely your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.220" end="00:37:02.950" style="s2">for cultivating meaningful relationships</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.550" end="00:37:05.380" style="s2">with yourself with other people and with</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.950" end="00:37:11.230" style="s2">the world and so the people who I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.380" end="00:37:13.560" style="s2">are starting to sense this as not just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.230" end="00:37:15.450" style="s2">momentary</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.560" end="00:37:16.890" style="s2">disruption because that&#39;s not what it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.450" end="00:37:18.870" style="s2">we should stop pretending that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.890" end="00:37:21.750" style="s2">is this is a long-term thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.870" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">facing and the end and Jordan Hall and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.750" end="00:37:26.340" style="s2">talked about this in a couple of recent</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">videos this is not going to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.340" end="00:37:30.750" style="s2">pandemic all other conditions that cause</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:31.980" style="s2">lists have not changed in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.750" end="00:37:33.480" style="s2">fact if anything they&#39;re going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.980" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">increasing we&#39;re gonna keep melting the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.480" end="00:37:36.740" style="s2">permafrost we&#39;re gonna keep cutting down</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.840" style="s2">the rainforests we&#39;re gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:43.190" style="s2">increasing our you know our travel and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.840" end="00:37:45.300" style="s2">our trade in grow in accelerating rates</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.190" end="00:37:45.960" style="s2">this is gonna happen again and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.300" end="00:37:49.350" style="s2">gonna happen again</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.960" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">and so the people who are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.350" end="00:37:55.530" style="s2">realize that this is could be something</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:57.750" style="s2">as game-changing could not maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.530" end="00:37:59.730" style="s2">this time but I&#39;m but with increasing</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:01.890" style="s2">frequency the probability of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.730" end="00:38:03.900" style="s2">happening is gonna go up dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.890" end="00:38:06.330" style="s2">we&#39;re facing something like what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.900" end="00:38:09.810" style="s2">Black Plague did to Europe in the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.330" end="00:38:12.300" style="s2">Ages and how it completely altered the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.810" end="00:38:15.360" style="s2">worldview the sense of agency and arena</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.300" end="00:38:17.070" style="s2">that people had in a profound and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.360" end="00:38:19.620" style="s2">irreversible manner I think we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.070" end="00:38:22.590" style="s2">that I&#39;d like I say maybe not this</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.620" end="00:38:25.080" style="s2">pandemic but I would predict within the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.590" end="00:38:27.210" style="s2">next one that&#39;s what this is maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.080" end="00:38:31.830" style="s2">minor pandemic for one thing young</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.210" end="00:38:35.100" style="s2">people are not dying you know absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.830" end="00:38:37.620" style="s2">terrible that elder people are dying but</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.100" end="00:38:40.530" style="s2">I think in the Spanish flu killed more</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.620" end="00:38:42.360" style="s2">people than olive oil longer or one or</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.530" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">something so back in having that every</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.360" end="00:38:49.410" style="s2">five years yeah there&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:51.270" style="s2">that&#39;s been kind of interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.410" end="00:38:54.120" style="s2">this interesting and interesting in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.270" end="00:38:57.710" style="s2">perverse way but our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.120" end="00:39:00.270" style="s2">time which already has been affected in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.710" end="00:39:02.760" style="s2">the way that Han talks about right the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.270" end="00:39:04.140" style="s2">third the aimless wizzy of time right</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.760" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">the effect that that has in our ontology</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.140" end="00:39:08.780" style="s2">is also changing as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:11.130" style="s2">that so for instance I find it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.780" end="00:39:13.110" style="s2">incredible in the proper meaning of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.130" end="00:39:15.450" style="s2">term that a month ago or just over a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.110" end="00:39:18.450" style="s2">month ago I was I was traveling around</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.450" end="00:39:20.460" style="s2">and I was in Italy for maybe about 10</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.450" end="00:39:22.940" style="s2">days and then I came back you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.460" end="00:39:27.060" style="s2">through a couple of its larger airports</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.940" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">more or less carefree coronavirus had</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.060" end="00:39:30.270" style="s2">started at that point to permeate</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:34.590" style="s2">consciousness but not knowing that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.270" end="00:39:36.300" style="s2">has now and and certainly there was no</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.590" end="00:39:38.280" style="s2">ordinance to self isolate when I got</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.300" end="00:39:40.290" style="s2">back that was just over a month ago</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.280" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">the world has changed utterly since then</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.290" end="00:39:45.360" style="s2">and and the the fact that such change</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:49.050" style="s2">could be so comprehensive and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.360" end="00:39:52.470" style="s2">instantaneous and every day every day</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.050" end="00:39:54.750" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s like there&#39;s this deepening</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:39:58.110" style="s2">recurrence that makes the virus feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:39:59.820" style="s2">cyclical like almost purgatorial right</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.110" end="00:40:01.290" style="s2">see cuz for many of us has dwelled in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.820" end="00:40:03.060" style="s2">our consciousness for only a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.290" end="00:40:06.270" style="s2">weeks and already it&#39;s starting to feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.060" end="00:40:08.340" style="s2">inexorable and interminable like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.270" end="00:40:11.460" style="s2">been living with it for an eternity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.340" end="00:40:12.900" style="s2">yet it&#39;s only been a few a few weeks so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.460" end="00:40:15.930" style="s2">the way that it leaders the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.900" end="00:40:18.600" style="s2">rests on our consciousness seems not to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.930" end="00:40:20.730" style="s2">track our typical experience of time so</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.600" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">I think our our ontology of passage of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.730" end="00:40:26.070" style="s2">ours is also changing because of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:29.100" style="s2">too and so you and the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.070" end="00:40:30.900" style="s2">you were talking about John of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.100" end="00:40:32.730" style="s2">transitory yielding to something</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.900" end="00:40:34.410" style="s2">indefinite I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.730" end="00:40:36.420" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite crossed that threshold yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.410" end="00:40:38.190" style="s2">but some people have and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.420" end="00:40:41.460" style="s2">when a quick critical mass crosses that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.190" end="00:40:45.260" style="s2">threshold that terror is the thing of</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.470" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">one that I&#39;m most apprehensive about is</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:57.750" style="s2">starts to realize that this may yet be</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">an indefinite state of affairs and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.750" end="00:41:01.830" style="s2">our relationship to the world with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:03.870" style="s2">fifth like the physiognomy of the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.830" end="00:41:05.850" style="s2">the countenance of the world is slowly</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.870" end="00:41:07.740" style="s2">slackening it&#39;s slowly starting to look</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.850" end="00:41:09.540" style="s2">crestfallen and when that physiognomy</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.740" end="00:41:13.380" style="s2">completely goes slack and loses its</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.540" end="00:41:16.110" style="s2">confidence that&#39;s when that&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.380" end="00:41:18.270" style="s2">worried about it&#39;s like a judgment or</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.110" end="00:41:20.940" style="s2">something it&#39;s like the last judgment</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.270" end="00:41:22.980" style="s2">like I&#39;m sorry to bring that up but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.940" end="00:41:25.110" style="s2">thinking at all it&#39;s I think of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.980" end="00:41:27.150" style="s2">some people are fully prepared in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.110" end="00:41:28.530" style="s2">sense they&#39;re spiritually preparing</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.150" end="00:41:30.210" style="s2">themselves and they have been for a long</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.530" end="00:41:32.100" style="s2">time and other people will be just</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.210" end="00:41:34.490" style="s2">totally unprepared I mean some people I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.100" end="00:41:37.770" style="s2">guess there&#39;s degrees of preparedness</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.490" end="00:41:40.320" style="s2">but but but it almost feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.770" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">almost feels like this apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.320" end="00:41:44.609" style="s2">biblical moments or something and but</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.200" style="s2">notice that could notice that answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.609" end="00:41:47.940" style="s2">notice that I think it&#39;s on Paul</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.200" end="00:41:49.500" style="s2">recently I haven&#39;t seen the video yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.940" end="00:41:51.900" style="s2">Paul vindicated one on whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.500" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">this is a judgment of God oh I just saw</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.900" end="00:41:57.170" style="s2">it it&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:59.849" style="s2">I don&#39;t like that&#39;s wonderful that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.170" end="00:42:02.040" style="s2">really good though I imposed is it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.849" end="00:42:05.970" style="s2">insightful II yeah well he always does</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.040" end="00:42:08.369" style="s2">that that goes other question so what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.970" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">wanted to say Andrew is notice how we</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.369" end="00:42:12.780" style="s2">are starting to shift and of course all</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:13.980" style="s2">of the and and and it should continue by</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.780" end="00:42:15.930" style="s2">the way all of the political</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.980" end="00:42:18.390" style="s2">socio-economic and most importantly the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.930" end="00:42:20.430" style="s2">medical language is still rolling but</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.390" end="00:42:23.040" style="s2">already the mythological language is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.430" end="00:42:25.140" style="s2">struggling to come to the fore and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">invoked it spontaneously Andrew Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.140" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">already invoked it it&#39;s part of his job</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:28.650" style="s2">to invoke their thoughts and I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:31.589" style="s2">as a compliment</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.650" end="00:42:35.490" style="s2">does any thoughts appalled right and one</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.589" end="00:42:37.500" style="s2">of my concerns one of my concerns is and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.490" end="00:42:42.390" style="s2">I was talking to this about Chris is</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.500" end="00:42:45.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s a pattern that could could</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.390" end="00:42:49.349" style="s2">potentially emerge in which this gives</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.750" end="00:42:50.940" style="s2">an initially a spike in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.349" end="00:42:52.910" style="s2">meaningfulness and I was talking also</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.940" end="00:42:55.400" style="s2">with this with Peter Lindbergh because</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.910" end="00:42:58.290" style="s2">when you can invoke those terms</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.400" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">seriously imagine being a imagine three</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.290" end="00:43:03.329" style="s2">three months ago trying to invoke</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:05.970" style="s2">judgment God&#39;s judgment and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.329" end="00:43:07.500" style="s2">apocalypse right seriously and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.970" end="00:43:09.390" style="s2">would have their eyes would have large</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.500" end="00:43:10.859" style="s2">like me Chris and I&#39;ve seen this when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.390" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">try to talk to people about this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.859" end="00:43:14.760" style="s2">always sort of glaze over and I&#39;ll you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:17.190" style="s2">know but notice how now you can say that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.760" end="00:43:20.040" style="s2">right you know it all sincerity and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.190" end="00:43:21.780" style="s2">can expect reasonably so to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.040" end="00:43:22.619" style="s2">seriously so that mythological language</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.780" end="00:43:25.050" style="s2">is coming out</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.619" end="00:43:28.740" style="s2">and notice what could i khalaf i it a</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.050" end="00:43:31.530" style="s2">little bit okay it please that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.740" end="00:43:33.270" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I&#39;m sorry I interrupted I</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.530" end="00:43:35.579" style="s2">didn&#39;t I don&#39;t want to miss attribute</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.270" end="00:43:38.339" style="s2">everything to you but I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.579" end="00:43:40.410" style="s2">say that you know I think what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.339" end="00:43:44.579" style="s2">happening for a lot of people is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.410" end="00:43:46.829" style="s2">you know the the virus right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.579" end="00:43:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s taken on the mythological and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.829" end="00:43:50.520" style="s2">I mean that the sense I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.450" end="00:43:52.600" style="s2">articulate the mythological role of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.520" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">an Old Testament deity</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.600" end="00:43:59.140" style="s2">the demonic chaotic aspect is out of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">blue unpredicted reality that will do</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.140" end="00:44:03.640" style="s2">what it will do remember God&#39;s name I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:06.370" style="s2">will be what I will be right the the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.640" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">nameable thing that comes in and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.370" end="00:44:11.830" style="s2">ubiquitous like some sort of spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:14.470" style="s2">you don&#39;t know who who has been taken by</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.830" end="00:44:16.060" style="s2">it and who hasn&#39;t and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.470" end="00:44:17.890" style="s2">falling as a judgment but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.060" end="00:44:20.170" style="s2">sure what the judgment is and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.890" end="00:44:21.700" style="s2">to be potentially assuring in a new a I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.170" end="00:44:24.490" style="s2">mean these this is a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.700" end="00:44:26.950" style="s2">that you know is strongly associated</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.490" end="00:44:31.150" style="s2">with like Old Testament deities and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.950" end="00:44:34.090" style="s2">the thing about that is is the problem I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.150" end="00:44:36.430" style="s2">see with that is that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.090" end="00:44:38.710" style="s2">potential danger associated with it as</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.430" end="00:44:41.560" style="s2">the mythological meaning we try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.710" end="00:44:43.480" style="s2">to bear uh-huh yes and so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.560" end="00:44:44.980" style="s2">maybe I interjected tumeric prematurely</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.480" end="00:44:46.540" style="s2">and I apologize for that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.980" end="00:44:50.650" style="s2">this is nevertheless an important point</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.540" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">to bring up well I want to say I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.650" end="00:44:54.490" style="s2">say that I don&#39;t think I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:57.100" style="s2">suggesting this is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.490" end="00:45:00.070" style="s2">punishment of God or any of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.100" end="00:45:02.770" style="s2">nonsense like III that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.070" end="00:45:05.650" style="s2">grotesque to me as a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.770" end="00:45:10.600" style="s2">right what what it what it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.650" end="00:45:13.900" style="s2">more is that some people some people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.600" end="00:45:19.690" style="s2">going to suffer meaninglessly and other</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.900" end="00:45:22.780" style="s2">people are going to you know have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.690" end="00:45:25.800" style="s2">deeper experience of life after such an</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.780" end="00:45:29.080" style="s2">event but why the term judgment then</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.800" end="00:45:31.720" style="s2">because yeah it just came to me when he</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.080" end="00:45:34.210" style="s2">was talking and he and and and I was I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.720" end="00:45:36.100" style="s2">was thinking of the the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.210" end="00:45:37.750" style="s2">and I was thinking of this the final</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.100" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">days and all this sort of stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.750" end="00:45:42.430" style="s2">some people make it into the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:44.020" style="s2">heaven and other people don&#39;t so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.430" end="00:45:46.780" style="s2">not and that&#39;s not that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.020" end="00:45:49.690" style="s2">existential than and and I wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.780" end="00:45:51.940" style="s2">to ascribe any kind of no no theism to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.690" end="00:45:53.170" style="s2">that even you know no I wasn&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.940" end="00:45:55.420" style="s2">do that that&#39;s why I was very careful to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.170" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">use the word myth you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.420" end="00:45:59.050" style="s2">saying is right that language came very</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:46:00.370" style="s2">naturally to you and what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.050" end="00:46:02.830" style="s2">important is exactly the point you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.370" end="00:46:03.550" style="s2">made you don&#39;t you don&#39;t hold to any of</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.830" end="00:46:06.130" style="s2">the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.550" end="00:46:08.440" style="s2">behind that language but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.130" end="00:46:11.080" style="s2">that those images that have been woven</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.440" end="00:46:12.760" style="s2">into our culture come spontaneously to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.080" end="00:46:13.930" style="s2">mind and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.760" end="00:46:16.120" style="s2">thanks Andrew I think that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.930" end="00:46:19.450" style="s2">happen for a lot of people in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.120" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">ways in a lot of circumstances and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.450" end="00:46:30.300" style="s2">is risky because that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:33.310" style="s2">thinking that can mobilize people in</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.300" end="00:46:35.820" style="s2">whatever even some pretty weird ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.310" end="00:46:40.870" style="s2">yeah yeah and so I think you can sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.820" end="00:46:44.950" style="s2">cults and cults and prophetic calls the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.870" end="00:46:47.800" style="s2">cleansing and purity and purification is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.950" end="00:46:50.740" style="s2">that language so far away from where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.800" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">are now it&#39;s not that far no no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.740" end="00:46:54.910" style="s2">because I mean already into certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:46:58.360" style="s2">forms of social intimacy are already</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.910" end="00:47:00.940" style="s2">appropriate so actually no purity purity</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.360" end="00:47:03.000" style="s2">codes abound right now and they may well</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.940" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">they may well persist in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.000" end="00:47:07.750" style="s2">but I was going to say to Andrew that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">think that the the instinct to find a</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.750" end="00:47:14.350" style="s2">certain amount of reflexivity to see a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:16.690" style="s2">reflection of ourselves born in the form</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.350" end="00:47:20.080" style="s2">of the virus even though even if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.690" end="00:47:23.710" style="s2">not even if we&#39;re not subscribing to the</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.630" style="s2">carefully the fact is that there is</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.780" end="00:48:51.010" style="s2">individually and as a culture well I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.850" end="00:48:54.100" style="s2">listening to this rabbi speak about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.010" end="00:48:55.600" style="s2">and if you were if you were an Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.100" end="00:49:00.370" style="s2">rabbi and you believe that everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.600" end="00:49:03.580" style="s2">that happened was God right you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.370" end="00:49:05.800" style="s2">would think that this also is God right</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.580" end="00:49:09.190" style="s2">and this is a divine thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.800" end="00:49:12.970" style="s2">happening uh-huh because the Messiah is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.190" end="00:49:15.220" style="s2">coming and and and therefore you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.970" end="00:49:17.620" style="s2">just have to keep sort of living your</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.220" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">life in in celebration and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.620" end="00:49:22.570" style="s2">oh this is this judgment and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:24.670" style="s2">being punished or or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.570" end="00:49:27.160" style="s2">that was the feeling I got from him as</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.670" end="00:49:29.500" style="s2">like a person of faith and how they see</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.160" end="00:49:32.860" style="s2">this and that doesn&#39;t take away from any</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.500" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">of the you know the pain and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.860" end="00:49:38.980" style="s2">suffering and all that it&#39;s just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:40.120" style="s2">know if I&#39;m being very clear and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.980" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say so it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.120" end="00:49:45.580" style="s2">opposite of what John was saying about</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">judgment is that it&#39;s not that people</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.580" end="00:49:50.170" style="s2">are being judged</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s that reality is coming in and if</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.170" end="00:49:55.510" style="s2">you were religious you would say divine</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:58.360" style="s2">reality is here you know this is divine</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.510" end="00:50:00.040" style="s2">reality I mean I&#39;m okay with using the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.360" end="00:50:02.500" style="s2">word divine maybe you want to see sacred</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.040" end="00:50:05.650" style="s2">but well I want to respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.500" end="00:50:07.510" style="s2">because ishi I think what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.650" end="00:50:08.890" style="s2">we face a choice and I think the word</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.510" end="00:50:10.120" style="s2">you invoked is the word that you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.890" end="00:50:12.700" style="s2">Jordan Hall and I are talking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.120" end="00:50:17.110" style="s2">about which is what does faith mean now</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.700" end="00:50:22.900" style="s2">and what does it and is there is there a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.110" end="00:50:25.240" style="s2">sense of faith that can put us into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.900" end="00:50:26.740" style="s2">the kind of situation we&#39;re in where</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.240" end="00:50:30.670" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about faith as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.740" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">attempt to bring about closure the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.670" end="00:50:36.280" style="s2">temp to two to reestablish and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:38.980" style="s2">Chris&#39;s sense of this word uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.280" end="00:50:42.190" style="s2">but faith is right because these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.980" end="00:50:43.600" style="s2">these are you know and this is this this</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.190" end="00:50:45.130" style="s2">is the fear I was trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.600" end="00:50:48.030" style="s2">with the potential mythological</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.130" end="00:50:50.260" style="s2">resurgence of sort of a demonic deity</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.030" end="00:50:53.550" style="s2">the deities that will promise a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.260" end="00:50:58.510" style="s2">certainty and closure and purity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.550" end="00:51:01.210" style="s2">protection right and that&#39;s I take that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.510" end="00:51:03.220" style="s2">as a very serious threat and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.210" end="00:51:04.540" style="s2">of the responsibilities I feel now and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.220" end="00:51:06.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve been privileged to work with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.540" end="00:51:08.080" style="s2">with that and also with Chris but two</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.370" end="00:51:10.090" style="s2">videos with Jordan is well there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.080" end="00:51:12.850" style="s2">alternative way of understanding faith</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.090" end="00:51:16.210" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that seeking for</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.850" end="00:51:19.150" style="s2">closure and completeness and purity and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.210" end="00:51:22.360" style="s2">perfection but instead is about a kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.150" end="00:51:25.090" style="s2">of it&#39;s a cultivated sense of being that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.360" end="00:51:28.150" style="s2">gives you a continuity of contact with</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.090" end="00:51:31.320" style="s2">things as they unfold so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.150" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">evolve with them and you have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.320" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">the course of that so that you are</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:40.120" style="s2">sensitive to Kairos and you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:44.080" style="s2">participate in it in in with effective</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.120" end="00:51:46.450" style="s2">agency that sense of faith rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.080" end="00:51:48.070" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me this word a worship</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.450" end="00:51:50.590" style="s2">based a sense of faith which is what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.070" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">was trying I&#39;m trying to pull these two</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.590" end="00:51:56.440" style="s2">things apart I&#39;m not trying to deny</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:58.750" style="s2">anybody their worship I you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.440" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">that I don&#39;t do but what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.750" end="00:52:04.510" style="s2">say is for those of us who don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">any kind of nostalgic return a viable</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.510" end="00:52:09.430" style="s2">option and I would really really hope we</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:12.610" style="s2">don&#39;t turn back to a demonic deity</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.430" end="00:52:14.260" style="s2">answer um then we do need to re</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.610" end="00:52:17.710" style="s2">articulate we need to bring up into</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.260" end="00:52:19.570" style="s2">dialogue and into dialectic the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.710" end="00:52:22.930" style="s2">faith that we started this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.570" end="00:52:24.730" style="s2">with the faith that Socrates has when he</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.930" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">says the unexamined life is not worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.730" end="00:52:29.500" style="s2">living how does he get that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2">certainty in the way that two plus two</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.500" end="00:52:33.940" style="s2">equals four it&#39;s not certainty but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:35.500" style="s2">a it&#39;s a he&#39;s in he&#39;s been he&#39;s lived</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.940" end="00:52:38.140" style="s2">his life there&#39;s been continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.500" end="00:52:41.500" style="s2">contact with an unfolding disclosure of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.140" end="00:52:44.260" style="s2">being that has vouchsafe to him what a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.500" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">meaningful life is and he&#39;s sensitized</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.260" end="00:52:47.150" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:49.160" style="s2">and acquired that tastes deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.150" end="00:52:50.750" style="s2">deeper and that&#39;s the kind of faith I</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.160" end="00:52:53.740" style="s2">want to try and bring out the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.750" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">faith that is in measurably in meshed</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.740" end="00:52:58.190" style="s2">with dia logos and that&#39;s what I&#39;m Trump</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.950" style="s2">that&#39;s why I brought up that whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.190" end="00:53:04.210" style="s2">concern that I had is that I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.950" end="00:53:08.540" style="s2">any of that that mythology that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.210" end="00:53:11.060" style="s2">like try to total eyes and shut down and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.540" end="00:53:13.460" style="s2">you know bring about the the closure and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.060" end="00:53:16.550" style="s2">the the completeness and the purity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.460" end="00:53:18.460" style="s2">the perfection but we need to resist</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.550" end="00:53:21.290" style="s2">that temptation and I&#39;m gonna use that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.460" end="00:53:23.030" style="s2">biblical sounding word deliberately and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.290" end="00:53:24.650" style="s2">and the way we can resist it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.030" end="00:53:27.619" style="s2">not just like trying to hold it off we</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.650" end="00:53:29.930" style="s2">have to beautify and fall in love with</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.619" end="00:53:33.320" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me Socratic faith as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.930" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">contrast to that that that that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.320" end="00:53:37.310" style="s2">know what they call it that demonic</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:40.040" style="s2">faith hmm Socratic faith and demonic</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.310" end="00:53:41.570" style="s2">faith okay I I think the other John that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.040" end="00:53:44.089" style="s2">there&#39;s also there&#39;s also a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.570" end="00:53:46.250" style="s2">the Socratic faith the disposition of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.089" end="00:53:47.690" style="s2">Socratic faith can carefully and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.250" end="00:53:50.180" style="s2">are collectively but maybe on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.690" end="00:53:53.650" style="s2">person-to-person basis the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.180" end="00:53:57.320" style="s2">faith can be applied as an attitude an</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.650" end="00:54:00.170" style="s2">interrogative attitude to foster</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.320" end="00:54:03.470" style="s2">dialogue with the motifs with the</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.849" end="00:54:11.210" style="s2">but I just want to say right I agree</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.130" end="00:54:15.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good point that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.210" end="00:54:17.210" style="s2">excellent point because there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:54:23.270" end="00:54:27.980" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to be able to wave them</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.680" end="00:54:30.380" style="s2">away or turn resolutely away from them</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.980" end="00:54:33.050" style="s2">and ignore them but we are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.380" end="00:54:34.940" style="s2">to find a way to bring them into our dye</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.050" end="00:54:38.390" style="s2">to enfold them into the dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.940" end="00:54:41.330" style="s2">process and and I&#39;m thinking very much</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.390" end="00:54:43.460" style="s2">in a in a sort of a union careful</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.349" end="00:54:49.880" style="s2">right and that&#39;s exactly what the whole</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.460" end="00:54:58.770" style="s2">was worried about with with just staying</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.740" end="00:55:03.510" style="s2">in this exercise</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.770" end="00:55:07.970" style="s2">mode of angst and and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.510" end="00:55:12.090" style="s2">is that we have to dive into these I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.970" end="00:55:14.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know into the symbolic world on</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.090" end="00:55:17.610" style="s2">some level and and and that takes a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.820" end="00:55:19.260" style="s2">of faith as well right yeah it does we</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.610" end="00:55:21.480" style="s2">need we need to know how to turn the Old</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.080" end="00:55:33.210" style="s2">completely correct and and wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.410" end="00:55:35.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the dialectic and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.210" end="00:55:38.390" style="s2">the pure dialectic that is expressing</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.550" end="00:55:40.860" style="s2">here that we can&#39;t get stuck on this one</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.390" end="00:55:43.260" style="s2">mode right Yee</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.860" end="00:55:44.970" style="s2">apologies I interrupted you again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.260" end="00:55:46.410" style="s2">it&#39;s about how about I have when I get</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.970" end="00:55:47.640" style="s2">accept we&#39;re all interrupting each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.410" end="00:55:49.950" style="s2">it&#39;s fine I just okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.640" end="00:55:52.980" style="s2">I just wanted to totally ignores I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.950" end="00:55:54.450" style="s2">what Chris just did there was like not</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.980" end="00:55:55.980" style="s2">only correct I think an example as you</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.450" end="00:55:57.750" style="s2">pointed out Andrew I think very astutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.980" end="00:56:01.860" style="s2">it exemplifies the very thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.750" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">trying to bring to the fore yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.860" end="00:56:06.450" style="s2">a way Chris is right I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">way of addressing my concern but like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.450" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">say in a process of conversion and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:14.370" style="s2">transformation rather than a simple</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.530" style="s2">process of exclusion I was falling prey</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.370" end="00:56:19.020" style="s2">to the very thing I was criticizing I</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.530" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">was trying to trace remove decode and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.020" end="00:56:23.130" style="s2">keeping keeping something at bay which</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:26.130" style="s2">is exactly the wrong thing to do so well</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.130" end="00:56:27.750" style="s2">we could think of a non-theistic mode of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.130" end="00:56:30.690" style="s2">looking at the last at the Last</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.750" end="00:56:33.090" style="s2">Judgement story or any of the old</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.690" end="00:56:34.650" style="s2">stories and a testament like but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.090" end="00:56:36.870" style="s2">not there to be understood in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.650" end="00:56:38.580" style="s2">absolute as you saying closed sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.870" end="00:56:40.440" style="s2">way right they&#39;re there to be worked</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.580" end="00:56:44.420" style="s2">worked at and looked at as a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.440" end="00:56:48.870" style="s2">sort of as a transparent window into</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.420" end="00:56:51.420" style="s2">reality of some some kind the trick is</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.870" end="00:56:54.660" style="s2">to keep them to I mean to keep enough of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.420" end="00:56:56.370" style="s2">the of the demonic within the demonic so</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.660" end="00:56:59.700" style="s2">that it can challenge us and shake us up</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.370" end="00:57:02.490" style="s2">because if we we need to be we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.700" end="00:57:04.380" style="s2">get into a place where we are open to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.490" end="00:57:05.550" style="s2">being surprised and shaken up because</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.380" end="00:57:10.530" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re now facing going</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.550" end="00:57:11.830" style="s2">forward in my estimation facing and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.530" end="00:57:13.570" style="s2">if we my</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.830" end="00:57:16.210" style="s2">we try to domesticate this with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.570" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">demonic that&#39;s my concern but I like</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.210" end="00:57:24.370" style="s2">Chris&#39;s idea that entering into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.520" end="00:57:26.590" style="s2">of Union dialectic wicket so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.370" end="00:57:28.930" style="s2">transform it into the socratic demonic I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.590" end="00:57:31.150" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.930" end="00:57:33.820" style="s2">insight Chris I think that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.150" end="00:57:36.130" style="s2">I personally idea of bringing young and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.820" end="00:57:38.320" style="s2">Socrates together because Socrates on</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.130" end="00:57:41.560" style="s2">his own feels very dry to me and young</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.320" end="00:57:43.720" style="s2">young is so rich nominal logically they</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.560" end="00:57:45.460" style="s2">make they make a wonderful marriage of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.720" end="00:57:47.640" style="s2">heaven and hell well Chris and I are</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.460" end="00:57:50.620" style="s2">gonna be working on a paper on that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.640" end="00:57:57.370" style="s2">actually probably for probably like</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.620" end="00:57:58.930" style="s2">Monday right top of mind for us no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.370" end="00:58:00.610" style="s2">just gonna say I like the way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.930" end="00:58:02.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve um I like the way you&#39;ve you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.610" end="00:58:04.090" style="s2">pinned it to a cat for his job to turn</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.170" end="00:58:06.070" style="s2">the demonic to the dynamic I think is oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.090" end="00:58:13.090" style="s2">I like that as a nice pissy turn</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.070" end="00:58:15.610" style="s2">phrasing yeah well thank you so I I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.090" end="00:58:17.470" style="s2">I was trying to get a turn of phrase</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.610" end="00:58:21.670" style="s2">that captured the turn of your insight</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.470" end="00:58:23.500" style="s2">so one thing that&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.670" end="00:58:25.960" style="s2">interesting for me to see in this</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.500" end="00:58:27.880" style="s2">process it&#39;s funny I&#39;m normally not much</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.960" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">of a news junky but of course I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.880" end="00:58:31.750" style="s2">probably like most of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:36.220" style="s2">world I&#39;ve become one in these these</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.750" end="00:58:44.110" style="s2">last days and sorry in the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.220" end="00:58:45.310" style="s2">days I don&#39;t mean these last days maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.110" end="00:58:49.000" style="s2">that was a Freudian slip</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.310" end="00:58:50.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t but but one thing that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.000" end="00:58:52.300" style="s2">really interesting and I mean we&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.500" end="00:58:56.230" style="s2">know we&#39;ve talked nauseam right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.300" end="00:58:58.120" style="s2">about about what the the diminishment of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.230" end="00:58:59.890" style="s2">our wisdom institutions has done in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.120" end="00:59:01.180" style="s2">longer term for our culture but one</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.890" end="00:59:04.600" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re really seeing right now</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.180" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">I find it fascinating you know every day</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.600" end="00:59:09.190" style="s2">when the politicians come out of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:11.950" style="s2">their sanctum and have to address the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.190" end="00:59:13.750" style="s2">public and they they&#39;re forced into a</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.950" end="00:59:15.730" style="s2">position of having to give platitudes</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.750" end="00:59:17.710" style="s2">and having to give reassurance and aside</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.730" end="00:59:19.300" style="s2">from just the practical and logistical</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.710" end="00:59:22.630" style="s2">messages that they have the issue</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.300" end="00:59:24.890" style="s2">they&#39;re also voiced with the demand of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.630" end="00:59:26.750" style="s2">bringing calm and bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.890" end="00:59:28.310" style="s2">perspective now it&#39;s one thing to bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.750" end="00:59:29.480" style="s2">calm to say you know folks we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.310" end="00:59:32.600" style="s2">the best we can we&#39;ve got it under</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.480" end="00:59:35.270" style="s2">control but you can see them struggling</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.600" end="00:59:36.940" style="s2">and I actually have I have sympathy for</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.270" end="00:59:39.590" style="s2">them in this respect because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.940" end="00:59:42.250" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in excess</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.590" end="00:59:44.990" style="s2">of their role it&#39;s beyond their office</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.250" end="00:59:47.510" style="s2">or at least it ought to be arguably it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.990" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">beyond their office to bring perspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.510" end="00:59:51.050" style="s2">to bring philosophic perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:52.970" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but because we don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.050" end="00:59:55.340" style="s2">mean obviously for those beholding to a</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.970" end="00:59:58.670" style="s2">certain faith and worship you know they</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.340" end="01:00:02.840" style="s2">they round on their their clergy etc but</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.670" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">for those for now a sizable I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.840" end="01:00:06.380" style="s2">majority in the West maybe minority in</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">the world but still a sizable minority</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.380" end="01:00:11.660" style="s2">in the world who don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:14.270" style="s2">offices to turn to we&#39;re rounding on our</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.660" end="01:00:16.270" style="s2">politicians to give us if you give us</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.270" end="01:00:19.250" style="s2">that perspective and there&#39;s I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.270" end="01:00:23.150" style="s2">they obviously don&#39;t have it that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.250" end="01:00:25.730" style="s2">to say individuals among them can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.150" end="01:00:27.350" style="s2">insightful I&#39;m sure they can but as an</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.730" end="01:00:29.510" style="s2">office they just that&#39;s not a and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.350" end="01:00:30.800" style="s2">not the office they hold and I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.510" end="01:00:33.650" style="s2">what we&#39;re starting to see right now is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.800" end="01:00:36.140" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to see that the gap the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.650" end="01:00:38.300" style="s2">vacuum the absence of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.140" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">institutions is particularly pronounced</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.300" end="01:00:41.480" style="s2">at a time like this</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">you mean the separation of church and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.480" end="01:00:48.460" style="s2">state is is is is showing up as being</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:51.230" style="s2">sort of schizophrenic</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.460" end="01:00:53.540" style="s2">yeah well the church part is that is in</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.230" end="01:00:56.300" style="s2">some ways absent altogether I mean not</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.540" end="01:00:57.710" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not but but for for</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.300" end="01:00:59.840" style="s2">many of us you know we&#39;re our first</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.710" end="01:01:03.650" style="s2">instinct is not in fact to look to</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.840" end="01:01:05.780" style="s2">church leaders for perspective and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.650" end="01:01:07.340" style="s2">we obviously look to our politicians to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.780" end="01:01:09.470" style="s2">give us the practical information we</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.340" end="01:01:11.540" style="s2">need to know our business but between</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.470" end="01:01:15.140" style="s2">those two things there is so fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.540" end="01:01:18.230" style="s2">chasm within which we we we have only</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.140" end="01:01:20.600" style="s2">ourselves to rely on but but this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.230" end="01:01:22.100" style="s2">again where the context and this way you</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.600" end="01:01:23.650" style="s2">have to have to be the dialogues with</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.100" end="01:01:26.450" style="s2">the drama in the context</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.650" end="01:01:29.000" style="s2">Socrates right you have to remember that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.450" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">when we&#39;re reading these dialogues where</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.000" end="01:01:35.510" style="s2">they set their set Athens is literally</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:38.430" style="s2">under siege people are walled in they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:01:43.530" end="01:01:50.430" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all that stuff is often</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.349" end="01:01:52.829" style="s2">the context surrounding right the both</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.430" end="01:01:54.809" style="s2">the dramatic context within which</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.829" end="01:01:56.940" style="s2">dialogues are set in the historical</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.809" end="01:01:59.790" style="s2">context in which Plato writes them and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.940" end="01:02:02.250" style="s2">they&#39;re originally presented Socrates is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.790" end="01:02:03.839" style="s2">very much he&#39;s not foreign to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.250" end="01:02:07.290" style="s2">situation we are talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:11.369" style="s2">he is birthed out of it he is there in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.290" end="01:02:14.339" style="s2">situation as you know as challenging as</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.369" end="01:02:17.550" style="s2">threatening as we are in and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.339" end="01:02:19.530" style="s2">it is again the practice that he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.550" end="01:02:21.750" style="s2">within that context that is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.530" end="01:02:26.220" style="s2">happenstance that is not happenstance</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.750" end="01:02:28.200" style="s2">and and again you know and he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.220" end="01:02:30.300" style="s2">trying to steal his way steer his way</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.300" end="01:02:36.180" style="s2">political skill and Charybdis as as</p>

<p begin="01:02:36.180" end="01:02:40.859" style="s2">political solution to what many people</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.950" end="01:02:44.339" style="s2">are now saying was ultimately you know a</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.859" end="01:02:47.640" style="s2">cultural and you know a meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.339" end="01:02:51.480" style="s2">for ancient heaven and he&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.640" end="01:02:54.420" style="s2">exemplify who we are supposed to be yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.480" end="01:02:56.520" style="s2">moment is what you&#39;re saying yes and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.420" end="01:02:57.900" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be Socrates or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.520" end="01:03:00.569" style="s2">what we&#39;re supposed to be doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.900" end="01:03:03.809" style="s2">supposed to choose the life the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.569" end="01:03:07.230" style="s2">meaningful life the life with later</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.809" end="01:03:08.280" style="s2">because the choice really Andrew I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.230" end="01:03:10.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what came out when I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.280" end="01:03:12.150" style="s2">talking to ethos this this morning right</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.200" end="01:03:15.180" style="s2">the choice really I mean initially</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.150" end="01:03:16.950" style="s2">initially first you know Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.180" end="01:03:20.190" style="s2">hierarchy mean yes I get it ischl either</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.950" end="01:03:22.290" style="s2">the choices live don&#39;t die yeah but but</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.190" end="01:03:24.059" style="s2">that is not a sustaining choice the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.290" end="01:03:26.309" style="s2">choice is ultimately are you are you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.059" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">living is it a good life you living</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.309" end="01:03:31.579" style="s2">right is it is it a life worth living</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:34.109" style="s2">III well this is somewhat personal but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.579" end="01:03:36.690" style="s2">decided and I&#39;ve chosen and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.109" end="01:03:38.130" style="s2">committed to it I don&#39;t if it comes to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.690" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">point where I have to sort of start</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.130" end="01:03:42.329" style="s2">violating the fundamental principles by</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">which I live in order to merely survive</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.329" end="01:03:48.510" style="s2">I rather and I mean this I would rather</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:52.049" style="s2">die I do not am I my own survival is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.510" end="01:03:54.719" style="s2">as valuable to me as the principles that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.049" end="01:03:56.579" style="s2">I that that you know that Ivan that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.719" end="01:03:59.150" style="s2">inherited from Socrates that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.579" end="01:04:02.699" style="s2">unexamined life yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.150" end="01:04:03.689" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah yeah he&#39;s at some point</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.699" end="01:04:05.759" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.689" end="01:04:07.829" style="s2">well sorry I&#39;m speaking I&#39;m over</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.759" end="01:04:11.130" style="s2">generalizing for my case out of hope</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.829" end="01:04:14.759" style="s2">maybe miss borne hope but I suspect that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.130" end="01:04:18.929" style="s2">many people will come to where they</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.759" end="01:04:19.739" style="s2">night might need to consider that right</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.929" end="01:04:22.410" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.739" end="01:04:26.630" style="s2">and if I can come back to the judgment</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.410" end="01:04:31.589" style="s2">again if you forgive me judgment is is</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.630" end="01:04:35.759" style="s2">maybe you live maybe you&#39;ll die but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.589" end="01:04:38.400" style="s2">judgment is really being able to say to</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.759" end="01:04:39.479" style="s2">yourself that you&#39;ve had a life worth</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.400" end="01:04:42.299" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.479" end="01:04:45.329" style="s2">yes so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not an imposed</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.299" end="01:04:47.999" style="s2">judgment of some helpless person uh-huh</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.329" end="01:04:51.929" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t have any say in what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.999" end="01:04:53.609" style="s2">on it&#39;s it&#39;s okay did I have judging am</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.929" end="01:04:56.099" style="s2">I good you judge it we judge ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.609" end="01:04:59.400" style="s2">right we we are judging ourselves not</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.099" end="01:05:02.249" style="s2">the final judgment is is is is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.400" end="01:05:03.449" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s some gods on its from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.249" end="01:05:06.539" style="s2">depths of Gotham you know the being</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.449" end="01:05:09.089" style="s2">whose being is in question okay and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.539" end="01:05:11.400" style="s2">ultimately have to we and we ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.089" end="01:05:12.929" style="s2">have to live that question as deeply as</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.400" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">possible and and the way you live a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.929" end="01:05:17.789" style="s2">question is by turning it into a quest</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:19.769" style="s2">nothing else you have to be open right a</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.789" end="01:05:23.449" style="s2">quest is an open journey towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.769" end="01:05:26.999" style="s2">continual revelation right and and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.449" end="01:05:31.229" style="s2">just I think that what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.999" end="01:05:33.660" style="s2">once the the endurance aspect of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.229" end="01:05:35.130" style="s2">once the emergency aspect of this is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.660" end="01:05:37.229" style="s2">little bit more back rounded and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.130" end="01:05:39.089" style="s2">endurance aspect comes out we have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.229" end="01:05:42.359" style="s2">gonna have to endure for a long time I</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.089" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">think this question about the resiliency</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.359" end="01:05:47.400" style="s2">of our of the meaning of our lives is</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:49.380" style="s2">going to become more pronounced as</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.400" end="01:05:52.619" style="s2">Christian and I think that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.380" end="01:05:55.170" style="s2">that&#39;s the judgment that you and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.619" end="01:05:57.929" style="s2">word in here means in French it means to</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.170" end="01:06:00.420" style="s2">make hard right yeah you&#39;re something so</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.929" end="01:06:01.880" style="s2">good point so there&#39;s a point where we</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.420" end="01:06:03.590" style="s2">can&#39;t be made hard right</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.880" end="01:06:06.470" style="s2">that&#39;s right one level we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.590" end="01:06:09.350" style="s2">made you know strong but not hard</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.470" end="01:06:10.700" style="s2">yeah yes well it&#39;s and yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.350" end="01:06:12.820" style="s2">what the storks are trying to get right</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.700" end="01:06:17.000" style="s2">again I have a meaning I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.820" end="01:06:18.620" style="s2">rereading some of releases meditations</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.000" end="01:06:20.990" style="s2">and you were saying at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.620" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">this conversation John that well you</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.990" end="01:06:24.170" style="s2">know what&#39;s gonna happen increasingly as</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:27.370" style="s2">people are going to retreat to those</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.170" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">relations that constitute them in most</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.370" end="01:06:33.410" style="s2">instinctively and and at one point at</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:35.120" style="s2">one point Marcus Aurelius effectively</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.410" end="01:06:36.710" style="s2">enumerates the sort of he enumerates</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.120" end="01:06:38.780" style="s2">them almost as a trinity of relations</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.710" end="01:06:41.750" style="s2">that ground our sense of being right one</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.780" end="01:06:43.100" style="s2">is to the vessel that envelops us the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.750" end="01:06:46.580" style="s2">second is to the sort of the divine</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.100" end="01:06:48.890" style="s2">cause that the source of all that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.580" end="01:06:51.350" style="s2">follows all beings and then the third is</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.890" end="01:06:52.760" style="s2">to those that live alongside us and when</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.350" end="01:06:55.370" style="s2">I think about that I that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.760" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a very comprehending Trinity of</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.370" end="01:07:04.370" style="s2">relations then that we can use as a way</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:06.800" style="s2">of refocusing ourselves at from a ground</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.370" end="01:07:08.180" style="s2">that is that is fundamentally deeper</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.800" end="01:07:11.420" style="s2">than the one that we&#39;re used to treading</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.180" end="01:07:12.860" style="s2">on and you&#39;re there you know the point</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.420" end="01:07:14.900" style="s2">of living within the question of being</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.860" end="01:07:17.570" style="s2">and questing after it is I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.900" end="01:07:20.840" style="s2">precisely what you meant John by this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.570" end="01:07:23.690" style="s2">the definition of faith it&#39;s not closure</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.840" end="01:07:28.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not the closing it&#39;s precisely the</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.690" end="01:07:31.790" style="s2">opening it&#39;s the it&#39;s the opening of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.970" end="01:07:34.280" style="s2">question that constitutes our being yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.790" end="01:07:36.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the finite continually longing for</p>

<p begin="01:08:50.359" end="01:08:53.359" style="s2">think so because because faith is</p>

<p begin="01:09:19.759" end="01:09:25.250" style="s2">I think we seek from faith it is to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.790" end="01:09:28.190" style="s2">our participatory knowing so plugged in</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.250" end="01:09:32.740" style="s2">to how things are unfolding that we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.190" end="01:09:35.560" style="s2">participate as fully as possible yeah</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.330" end="01:10:04.790" style="s2">like it&#39;s a tonic form for that very</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.070" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">reason yeah like I guess I drew an</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.790" end="01:10:09.800" style="s2">another way of bridging between the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:11.830" style="s2">meanings of faith and wisdom is that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.800" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">notion of reverence which is the ability</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.830" end="01:10:19.970" style="s2">to you know to to sense the relevance of</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:22.340" style="s2">that which is beyond you appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.970" end="01:10:24.409" style="s2">to be appropriately fitted to that which</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.340" end="01:10:28.070" style="s2">transcends your egocentric framework</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.409" end="01:10:30.350" style="s2">and and give it a kind what what Iris</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.070" end="01:10:32.360" style="s2">Murdoch calls a justice of attention</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.350" end="01:10:34.550" style="s2">that you give an appropriate attention</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.360" end="01:10:36.590" style="s2">you give it the attention it deserves to</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.550" end="01:10:38.960" style="s2">the degree it deserves it knowing how to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.590" end="01:10:41.570" style="s2">do that is a profound kind of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.960" end="01:10:43.670" style="s2">Woodruff in fact argues that a reverence</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.570" end="01:10:44.690" style="s2">is a missing virtue for us so I would</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.670" end="01:10:46.820" style="s2">sort of put these together as</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.690" end="01:10:50.000" style="s2">overlapping and woven you know Islam</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.820" end="01:10:52.219" style="s2">referencing and faith when you say when</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.000" end="01:10:54.620" style="s2">you say reverence what comes to my mind</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.219" end="01:10:57.739" style="s2">is worship and you hear you&#39;re rejecting</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.620" end="01:11:01.250" style="s2">this idea of worship and and I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.739" end="01:11:03.320" style="s2">I think reverences not quite enough</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.250" end="01:11:05.540" style="s2">because if you&#39;re revering something</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.320" end="01:11:07.820" style="s2">you&#39;re still at a distance from it if</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.540" end="01:11:09.380" style="s2">you&#39;re worshiping something or if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.820" end="01:11:11.150" style="s2">find something divine if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.380" end="01:11:13.449" style="s2">something as sacred you&#39;re still at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.150" end="01:11:17.810" style="s2">distance from it if something is divine</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.449" end="01:11:20.060" style="s2">you know then if something if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.810" end="01:11:22.070" style="s2">something you worship then then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.060" end="01:11:26.210" style="s2">then you fall into it</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.070" end="01:11:27.739" style="s2">well so that&#39;s just my no no like that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.210" end="01:11:30.050" style="s2">but I want to challenge you because I</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.739" end="01:11:32.780" style="s2">might think the appropriate the way I</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.050" end="01:11:34.760" style="s2">want to say that is that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.780" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">Socratic figure is actually supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.760" end="01:11:39.800" style="s2">be the symbol on the sage is supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:42.560" style="s2">be that which I mean that through which</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.800" end="01:11:46.070" style="s2">we connect those we cross that distance</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.560" end="01:11:48.500" style="s2">we don&#39;t collapse it we bridge a right</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.070" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">and and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.500" end="01:11:52.909" style="s2">thing and what I mean by reverence I</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:53.960" style="s2">take your point well and I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.909" end="01:11:55.219" style="s2">to invoke worship we should have</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.960" end="01:11:58.400" style="s2">worshipped Socrates I think they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.219" end="01:12:01.900" style="s2">ridiculous and you find horrifying but</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.400" end="01:12:04.670" style="s2">why do we worship kind of we worship I</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.900" end="01:12:08.870" style="s2">used to worship Leonard Cohen for</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.670" end="01:12:11.960" style="s2">example you know or my gay friend</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.870" end="01:12:15.380" style="s2">Alexander right worship Bette Midler and</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.960" end="01:12:17.030" style="s2">say she was divine you see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.380" end="01:12:19.610" style="s2">trying to say them I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.030" end="01:12:21.560" style="s2">that that that there&#39;s yeah you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.610" end="01:12:23.420" style="s2">we&#39;re both right in a way like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.560" end="01:12:26.150" style="s2">right to say yes we need this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.420" end="01:12:28.429" style="s2">bridge yeah but I think the bridge</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.150" end="01:12:31.310" style="s2">collapse is that at a certain point when</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.429" end="01:12:33.710" style="s2">when we&#39;re fully involved in what well I</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.310" end="01:12:36.230" style="s2">think we should internalize the sage but</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.710" end="01:12:37.550" style="s2">we should never be satisfied and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.230" end="01:12:40.670" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get with</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.550" end="01:12:42.920" style="s2">a sense of being being a feeling like</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.670" end="01:12:45.470" style="s2">you&#39;re you you realized the relevance of</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.920" end="01:12:48.020" style="s2">something right but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.470" end="01:12:51.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve you have you have conquered it or</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.020" end="01:12:53.870" style="s2">consumed it like you we should</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.470" end="01:12:56.650" style="s2">internalized I mean funnily the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.870" end="01:12:59.090" style="s2">quote comes to mind which is really good</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.650" end="01:13:00.950" style="s2">although it presents it in a negative</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.090" end="01:13:05.150" style="s2">way is Nietzsche&#39;s quote about Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.950" end="01:13:07.640" style="s2">he said I hate Socrates he&#39;s so close to</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.150" end="01:13:10.220" style="s2">me I&#39;m always fighting him now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.640" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">not worship but that&#39;s reverence man he</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.220" end="01:13:15.230" style="s2">like he Socrates is so close to him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:17.870" style="s2">always fighting him Socrates is this</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.230" end="01:13:20.570" style="s2">deeply deeply internalized challenging</p>

<p begin="01:13:20.570" end="01:13:27.200" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of right not that I so what</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">I think when I&#39;m talking about reverence</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.200" end="01:13:32.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m talking not about worship</p>

<p begin="01:14:21.080" end="01:14:25.760" style="s2">a kind of worship or even putting off at</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.240" end="01:14:27.980" style="s2">a distance but I don&#39;t also want an over</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.760" end="01:14:31.070" style="s2">familiarization we need to keep the sage</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.980" end="01:14:33.530" style="s2">and reality ultimately mysterious and a</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.070" end="01:14:35.330" style="s2">tip-offs for us it&#39;s like a fire if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.530" end="01:14:36.980" style="s2">get too close to it you get burned or</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.330" end="01:14:38.240" style="s2">sight and so you got it you got to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.980" end="01:14:40.940" style="s2">the Goldilocks zone where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.240" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">intimate but the fire can still burn and</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.940" end="01:14:45.170" style="s2">can still threaten you and say I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.280" end="01:14:47.060" style="s2">and this is why you know Greek myth</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.170" end="01:14:48.980" style="s2">always pears the hero myth with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.060" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">hubris myth for all the myths of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.980" end="01:14:53.190" style="s2">hero facing the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:55.830" style="s2">right there&#39;s the hubris myth that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.190" end="01:14:57.750" style="s2">fly too close to the Sun right or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.830" end="01:15:00.050" style="s2">you know don&#39;t try and ride that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.750" end="01:15:02.910" style="s2">chariot of the Sun or don&#39;t compete with</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.050" end="01:15:04.740" style="s2">with act with with Athena for being the</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.910" end="01:15:08.130" style="s2">greatest Weaver you have all of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.740" end="01:15:10.230" style="s2">right hubris because the point is yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.130" end="01:15:12.750" style="s2">you know we should have we should come</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.230" end="01:15:15.630" style="s2">in too close you know contact with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.750" end="01:15:17.310" style="s2">gods but you know in even Plato said</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.630" end="01:15:20.280" style="s2">this you know you should you to try and</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.310" end="01:15:22.860" style="s2">expect to live there all the time is is</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.280" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">a ridiculous concern and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.860" end="01:15:26.220" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get out with the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:27.690" style="s2">reverence that&#39;s why there&#39;s an eros is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.220" end="01:15:30.270" style="s2">that there&#39;s always the tin generis</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.690" end="01:15:32.010" style="s2">implicit in that reference because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.270" end="01:15:34.650" style="s2">precisely because the eros slacks</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.010" end="01:15:37.500" style="s2">acquisition what they see in the thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.650" end="01:15:40.860" style="s2">about eros is I mean this was it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.500" end="01:15:42.960" style="s2">mixture right it&#39;s both a lack and a</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.860" end="01:15:44.940" style="s2">revelation and and Plato may differ and</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.960" end="01:15:47.520" style="s2">you know in the symposium with Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.940" end="01:15:50.730" style="s2">in eros how eros combines both of those</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.520" end="01:15:53.970" style="s2">aspects together Russ wants us to draw</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.730" end="01:15:57.210" style="s2">something into intimacy but eros should</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.970" end="01:15:59.670" style="s2">also remind us of that which we always</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.210" end="01:16:02.070" style="s2">lack and always will like right right</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.670" end="01:16:03.330" style="s2">yeah exactly I guess so I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.070" end="01:16:06.270" style="s2">what I&#39;m that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.330" end="01:16:08.610" style="s2">that the air us like I I I understand</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.270" end="01:16:10.950" style="s2">the difference between respect and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.610" end="01:16:13.980" style="s2">reverence as being that very difference</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.950" end="01:16:15.690" style="s2">that one contains within it the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.980" end="01:16:17.880" style="s2">disposition of arrows and one</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.690" end="01:16:19.830" style="s2">fundamentally does not yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.880" end="01:16:21.930" style="s2">all right that&#39;s I think that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.830" end="01:16:24.150" style="s2">what I was trying to put my finger on as</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.930" end="01:16:26.190" style="s2">long as we don&#39;t take just the current</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.150" end="01:16:29.940" style="s2">meaning of eros no no of course not of</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.190" end="01:16:31.440" style="s2">course is it there a place also for</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.940" end="01:16:34.430" style="s2">worship though I&#39;m still I&#39;m holding on</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.440" end="01:16:39.270" style="s2">to this thing because it&#39;s because I</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.430" end="01:16:41.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know you you you if you&#39;re you you</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.270" end="01:16:44.130" style="s2">worship let&#39;s say maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.010" end="01:16:45.900" style="s2">worship the person themselves or the you</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.130" end="01:16:48.300" style="s2">worship what they represent the you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.900" end="01:16:52.020" style="s2">worship the divine double or you worship</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.300" end="01:16:53.940" style="s2">them hmm I don&#39;t know I guess it depends</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.020" end="01:16:55.880" style="s2">what you mean by that word I mean I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.940" end="01:16:58.710" style="s2">already articulated that I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.880" end="01:17:01.080" style="s2">philosophy is and this is a Socratic</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.710" end="01:17:02.910" style="s2">Maxim is bound up with the combination</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.080" end="01:17:04.290" style="s2">of a deep knowing of yourself and wonder</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.910" end="01:17:05.160" style="s2">in which yourself is called into</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.290" end="01:17:07.620" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.160" end="01:17:08.910" style="s2">you both coming engage on the project</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.620" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">and those are course and separately</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.910" end="01:17:11.880" style="s2">bound up together</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:13.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t deeply come to know yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.880" end="01:17:17.070" style="s2">and knowing yourself is always always</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.970" end="01:17:19.320" style="s2">Socratic ly knowing the depths of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.070" end="01:17:20.910" style="s2">world that you you belong to you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.320" end="01:17:22.380" style="s2">know yourself deeply unless you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.910" end="01:17:25.260" style="s2">capable of calling it deeply into</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.380" end="01:17:30.120" style="s2">question and so Wonder and awe I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.260" end="01:17:32.460" style="s2">are inseparable from this project I mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.120" end="01:17:33.330" style="s2">I think Plato in fact is part of the way</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.460" end="01:17:35.790" style="s2">you can understand his whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.330" end="01:17:40.200" style="s2">philosophical project is to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.790" end="01:17:43.110" style="s2">dialectic so that we we afford via logos</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.200" end="01:17:45.900" style="s2">and do logos will deepen wonder into awe</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.110" end="01:17:49.230" style="s2">and then aw is for its own sake because</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.900" end="01:17:50.880" style="s2">oh is that that state where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.230" end="01:17:52.860" style="s2">getting sort of the depths of ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.880" end="01:17:54.270" style="s2">and the depths of reality resonating</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.860" end="01:17:59.460" style="s2">with each other and a really powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.270" end="01:18:00.990" style="s2">and and and in its moving of its own</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.460" end="01:18:04.020" style="s2">accord it&#39;s not at the direction of our</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.990" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">egocentric projects or desires so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.020" end="01:18:10.650" style="s2">think if you mean by worship a seeking</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:13.580" style="s2">out of practices that induce ah that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.650" end="01:18:15.720" style="s2">that&#39;s fine I don&#39;t have any problem but</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.580" end="01:18:19.050" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.720" end="01:18:21.680" style="s2">worship and so I see worship is what</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.050" end="01:18:24.150" style="s2">draws you out of your ISA egocentricity</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.680" end="01:18:26.910" style="s2">towards our and then you can leave</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.150" end="01:18:29.460" style="s2">behind the worship once you&#39;ve arrived</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.910" end="01:18:32.130" style="s2">at the off but it&#39;s but it&#39;s a stage</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.460" end="01:18:34.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it could be and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.130" end="01:18:36.840" style="s2">very Buddhist so and and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.980" end="01:18:38.820" style="s2">remain open to this and see I&#39;m even</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.840" end="01:18:40.170" style="s2">crossing my arms instinctively because I</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.820" end="01:18:41.490" style="s2">go up I was brought up on some</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.170" end="01:18:42.720" style="s2">fundamentalist Christian and worship</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.490" end="01:18:47.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t meet what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.720" end="01:18:47.780" style="s2">right now at all mm-hmm means a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.140" end="01:18:52.940" style="s2">fruitless and I mean that deeply a</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.820" end="01:18:55.260" style="s2">fruitless kind of self-sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.940" end="01:18:58.320" style="s2">towards a God who seems to be nothing</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.260" end="01:19:01.050" style="s2">but a car a consummate narcissist who</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.320" end="01:19:03.300" style="s2">needs endless praise and devotion while</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.050" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">telling us that we should never ever be</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.300" end="01:19:07.260" style="s2">self-centered we should be like him but</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:09.300" style="s2">what he seems to need more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.260" end="01:19:11.220" style="s2">else is constant praise adoration and</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.300" end="01:19:13.260" style="s2">worship and being put at number one no</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.220" end="01:19:15.450" style="s2">matter what&#39;s happening at all costs in</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.260" end="01:19:17.639" style="s2">all endeavors and I mean and I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.450" end="01:19:19.829" style="s2">see and I feel privileged</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.639" end="01:19:23.699" style="s2">to have experienced this in a negative</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.829" end="01:19:25.979" style="s2">sense of privilege because if that that</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.699" end="01:19:29.789" style="s2">I saw no good come out of that in</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.979" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">people&#39;s lives and it definitely hurt</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.789" end="01:19:34.920" style="s2">and traumatized me in in powerful ways</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.360" end="01:19:38.429" style="s2">and if that&#39;s what you mean by worship</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.920" end="01:19:42.929" style="s2">then I yeah I I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.429" end="01:19:44.969" style="s2">I mean by worship is that many people do</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.929" end="01:19:47.219" style="s2">mean that by worship many people sure do</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.969" end="01:19:47.639" style="s2">I agree with you yeah mmm I take your</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.219" end="01:19:50.039" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.639" end="01:19:52.110" style="s2">I&#39;m sensing a lot of congruence between</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.039" end="01:19:53.130" style="s2">what you&#39;re both saying I say I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.110" end="01:19:54.749" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s a bit of a</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.749" end="01:19:58.499" style="s2">fundamentally what I&#39;m what I&#39;m getting</p>

<p begin="01:20:02.219" end="01:20:05.909" style="s2">think what you mean by worship is the</p>

<p begin="01:20:38.309" end="01:20:41.820" style="s2">the same praxis and that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.900" end="01:20:43.800" style="s2">fundamentally the two of you were</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.820" end="01:20:46.409" style="s2">talking about is it&#39;s not exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.800" end="01:20:47.489" style="s2">same at least continues I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.409" end="01:20:49.229" style="s2">right I think that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.489" end="01:20:50.789" style="s2">putting it and maybe we could</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.229" end="01:20:54.179" style="s2">distinguish it this way there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.789" end="01:20:57.059" style="s2">idolatrous sense of worship and there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.179" end="01:20:59.130" style="s2">an iconic not in person in a carbon</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.059" end="01:21:00.659" style="s2">sense I was thinking about I can&#39;t I can</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.130" end="01:21:04.019" style="s2">eyes I&#39;m like how you would worship an</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.659" end="01:21:06.090" style="s2">icon if you were a Christian Orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.019" end="01:21:08.550" style="s2">person you had worship this icon as</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.090" end="01:21:10.380" style="s2">being as being a symbol of the divine or</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.550" end="01:21:11.880" style="s2">yeah and that and that&#39;s exactly what I</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.380" end="01:21:13.739" style="s2">meant by the sage it brings you close</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.880" end="01:21:15.780" style="s2">but also beckons you beyond and he never</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.739" end="01:21:18.449" style="s2">allows you to it brings you close but</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.780" end="01:21:20.249" style="s2">never allows you to enclose and and if</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.449" end="01:21:22.979" style="s2">that&#39;s what you mean by worship and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.249" end="01:21:24.300" style="s2">think Chris is right Andrew I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.979" end="01:21:27.570" style="s2">pointing to the convergence is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.300" end="01:21:29.099" style="s2">right then I think that is a central</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.570" end="01:21:30.930" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re talking about when</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.099" end="01:21:34.500" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about Socratic faith</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.930" end="01:21:36.930" style="s2">what&#39;s happening that what can emerge</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.500" end="01:21:39.300" style="s2">when de Lobos emerges there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.930" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">reverence it can be uh inspiring and it</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.300" end="01:21:43.170" style="s2">may even become symbolic in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:45.060" style="s2">worshipful way you&#39;re talking about but</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.170" end="01:21:46.440" style="s2">what it shouldn&#39;t be and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.060" end="01:21:48.870" style="s2">what&#39;s clear Plato continually</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.440" end="01:21:50.520" style="s2">undermines and what I had the invective</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.870" end="01:21:55.320" style="s2">of from my own experiences it should</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.520" end="01:21:57.120" style="s2">never become idolatrous worship I also I</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.320" end="01:21:58.980" style="s2">also filled yeah I think that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.120" end="01:22:01.980" style="s2">said John I also feel I also feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.980" end="01:22:03.780" style="s2">compelled to notice that for some even</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.980" end="01:22:06.540" style="s2">though your particular experience of</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.780" end="01:22:09.090" style="s2">ritual a Dori the ritual adoration of</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.540" end="01:22:11.460" style="s2">Christ was idolatrous in the way that it</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.090" end="01:22:15.090" style="s2">was forced on you for for many</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.460" end="01:22:17.220" style="s2">Christians and I can&#39;t trap myself among</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.090" end="01:22:19.470" style="s2">them but for many Christians I and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.220" end="01:22:21.680" style="s2">trust this implicitly because I know</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.470" end="01:22:25.320" style="s2">some of them very very thoughtfully for</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.680" end="01:22:27.930" style="s2">for some Christians the adoration is an</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.320" end="01:22:31.410" style="s2">iconic adoration and the way that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.930" end="01:22:32.760" style="s2">just described I I envy them that but</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.410" end="01:22:35.820" style="s2">many of them many of them have that</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.760" end="01:22:37.500" style="s2">experience for genuinely an example he</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.820" end="01:22:39.660" style="s2">recorded know what I have the opposite</p>

<p begin="01:22:39.660" end="01:22:46.080" style="s2">without religion of any kind right so</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.890" end="01:22:49.140" style="s2">everything you know I&#39;m still very very</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.080" end="01:22:53.190" style="s2">attracted to the esoteric aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.140" end="01:22:56.190" style="s2">religion which lead into mystery and not</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.190" end="01:22:58.110" style="s2">into this you know and and I&#39;m very I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.190" end="01:23:01.050" style="s2">kind of critical about the clinical</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.110" end="01:23:02.700" style="s2">Buddhists sort of where aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.050" end="01:23:06.510" style="s2">Buddhism which doesn&#39;t have worship</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.700" end="01:23:09.480" style="s2">which is is very let&#39;s say dry and</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.510" end="01:23:14.460" style="s2">pseudo-scientific and psychological and</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.480" end="01:23:16.680" style="s2">whereas I whereas and I&#39;m also attracted</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.460" end="01:23:19.110" style="s2">the Orthodox tradition because because</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.680" end="01:23:20.880" style="s2">they there&#39;s this passionate aspect to</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.110" end="01:23:24.810" style="s2">it but I can I can definitely see how</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.880" end="01:23:28.550" style="s2">that can can go dark and and and can it</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.810" end="01:23:32.170" style="s2">can be demonic and the opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.550" end="01:23:33.970" style="s2">wisdom of any kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.170" end="01:23:36.820" style="s2">but see what see what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.970" end="01:23:38.920" style="s2">see how I mean look what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.820" end="01:23:40.960" style="s2">between the three of us yeah right the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.920" end="01:23:42.340" style="s2">deal logos the third factors emerging</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.960" end="01:23:45.280" style="s2">none of us could have got here on our</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.340" end="01:23:47.200" style="s2">own it&#39;s leading us in a way I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.280" end="01:23:49.630" style="s2">like things are being disclosed in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.200" end="01:23:52.000" style="s2">powerful way and we&#39;re seeing how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.630" end="01:23:54.340" style="s2">inevitably being that into the depths of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.000" end="01:23:56.170" style="s2">religio and it&#39;s in its deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.340" end="01:23:58.510" style="s2">relationship although not its identity</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.170" end="01:24:00.280" style="s2">with religion as we&#39;re trying to grapple</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.510" end="01:24:03.220" style="s2">with the situation that&#39;s confronting us</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.280" end="01:24:05.980" style="s2">I think this is exactly yeah Chris and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.220" end="01:24:08.260" style="s2">are talking about yeah I and I love how</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.980" end="01:24:10.510" style="s2">what what I am what I find I agree</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.260" end="01:24:11.860" style="s2">John and I think that one way I think I</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.510" end="01:24:15.550" style="s2">think Corbin puts it this way he</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.860" end="01:24:18.430" style="s2">correctly from wrong but I think that</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.550" end="01:24:20.230" style="s2">one of the ways in which he phrases the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.430" end="01:24:22.480" style="s2">relationship of the individual to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.230" end="01:24:25.060" style="s2">divine angel is that we are subjects of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.480" end="01:24:26.740" style="s2">the verb that is the divine angel and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.060" end="01:24:31.300" style="s2">think that in the throes of diello go</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.740" end="01:24:34.720" style="s2">like this I feel subject to a verb from</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.300" end="01:24:36.610" style="s2">without in very much that way and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.720" end="01:24:39.220" style="s2">you notice how your gesture was</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.610" end="01:24:42.310" style="s2">automatic yeah I feel like I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.220" end="01:24:46.020" style="s2">lifted up yes yeah and I&#39;d be doing this</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.310" end="01:24:49.510" style="s2">too like that being lifted up that uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.020" end="01:24:52.150" style="s2">this is the point though Andrew mentions</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.510" end="01:24:54.580" style="s2">notice how the horizontal is a meshed</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.150" end="01:24:57.340" style="s2">inexorably with the vertical with a</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.580" end="01:24:58.890" style="s2">vertical now the two are just deeply</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.340" end="01:25:00.940" style="s2">interwoven and on all we can</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.890" end="01:25:02.110" style="s2">analytically talk about them as</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.940" end="01:25:03.700" style="s2">distinctive dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.110" end="01:25:05.050" style="s2">notice how phenomenologically and</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.700" end="01:25:08.020" style="s2">functionally they are so interwoven</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.050" end="01:25:10.630" style="s2">together yes and then our relationship</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.020" end="01:25:12.430" style="s2">to then to add the another dimension to</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.630" end="01:25:13.870" style="s2">that that there our relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.430" end="01:25:15.730" style="s2">our relationship right now with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.870" end="01:25:17.860" style="s2">passage of time also changes yes when</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.730" end="01:25:20.080" style="s2">we&#39;re deeply immersed in us yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.860" end="01:25:21.790" style="s2">then also to add the next this</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.080" end="01:25:23.890" style="s2">conversation notice how much I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.790" end="01:25:25.000" style="s2">alluding to other conversations and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.890" end="01:25:27.730" style="s2">Andrew you and I have had conversations</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.000" end="01:25:29.740" style="s2">and Andrew you and Chris are like so</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.730" end="01:25:32.980" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where this particular</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.740" end="01:25:35.500" style="s2">moment of dialectic is sitting in this</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.980" end="01:25:37.360" style="s2">network of all these other conversations</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.500" end="01:25:38.920" style="s2">that have this kind of meta dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.360" end="01:25:40.750" style="s2">going on between them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.920" end="01:25:42.850" style="s2">all informing and constraining each</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.750" end="01:25:45.130" style="s2">other right now right here right now and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.850" end="01:25:46.810" style="s2">then this dialogue will go into that</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.130" end="01:25:49.450" style="s2">network of constraints on further</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.810" end="01:25:50.590" style="s2">conversations mm-hmm right right like</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.450" end="01:25:52.540" style="s2">they&#39;re like they&#39;re all they&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="01:25:52.540" end="01:25:59.530" style="s2">they&#39;re all yeah I thought of indras net</p>

<p begin="01:25:59.530" end="01:26:04.180" style="s2">sense notion of indras net is is totally</p>

<p begin="01:26:53.560" end="01:27:00.070" style="s2">reflects all the others so there&#39;s each</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.260" end="01:27:01.600" style="s2">one is is right so this jewel is just</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.070" end="01:27:05.830" style="s2">the reflection of all the other jewels</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.600" end="01:27:08.710" style="s2">right okay okay so it&#39;s like whiteheads</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.830" end="01:27:10.540" style="s2">notion of you know every moment is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.710" end="01:27:12.340" style="s2">entire collapse of the universe so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.540" end="01:27:14.560" style="s2">entire universe is collapsing to that</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.340" end="01:27:16.420" style="s2">moment but that moment is included in</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.560" end="01:27:17.950" style="s2">the collapse towards this moment and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.420" end="01:27:20.560" style="s2">everything it&#39;s really everything is</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.950" end="01:27:24.000" style="s2">mutually the toe Hannah yeah well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.560" end="01:27:27.070" style="s2">and then that&#39;s then Platonists clearly</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.000" end="01:27:29.290" style="s2">explicitly articulates that also of how</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.070" end="01:27:31.840" style="s2">the forms are related to each other</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.290" end="01:27:34.650" style="s2">within news so that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.840" end="01:27:37.240" style="s2">yeah but what a beautifully woven</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.650" end="01:27:38.980" style="s2">metaphor well what&#39;s cool for me is I</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.240" end="01:27:41.410" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of this holographic</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.980" end="01:27:43.330" style="s2">deep learning because what it is is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.410" end="01:27:45.250" style="s2">in this holographic multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.330" end="01:27:47.260" style="s2">compression and variation function</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.250" end="01:27:49.030" style="s2">everything is compressing and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.260" end="01:27:51.250" style="s2">everything is varying but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.030" end="01:27:53.320" style="s2">sort of like in in a neural networks one</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.250" end="01:27:54.910" style="s2">oppression one variation everything is</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.320" end="01:27:56.830" style="s2">compressing and burying for everything</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.910" end="01:27:59.170" style="s2">else and so reality is like this an</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.830" end="01:28:01.750" style="s2">amazing amazing holographic deep</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.170" end="01:28:04.060" style="s2">learning network yeah right well I was</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.750" end="01:28:07.900" style="s2">also thinking about to be just slightly</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.060" end="01:28:09.610" style="s2">more prosaic about about Zach when we</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.900" end="01:28:13.510" style="s2">talked with Zach he said that this was a</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.610" end="01:28:15.490" style="s2">jam and there were three of us yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.510" end="01:28:18.550" style="s2">you know we started out I started off</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.490" end="01:28:20.560" style="s2">having dyad like conversations with with</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.550" end="01:28:25.510" style="s2">John and then conversation and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.560" end="01:28:28.150" style="s2">become a triad it&#39;s become a like the</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.510" end="01:28:30.880" style="s2">Jimi Hendrix Experience or something</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.150" end="01:28:34.270" style="s2">well you know I&#39;m being the drummer and</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.880" end="01:28:38.470" style="s2">I&#39;m a bit wild and and and and John is</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.270" end="01:28:40.600" style="s2">is sort of keeping us together and very</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.470" end="01:28:44.590" style="s2">passionate and Chris is maybe the bass</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.600" end="01:28:46.570" style="s2">player it seems like it seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.590" end="01:28:47.890" style="s2">kind of musicality and and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.570" end="01:28:49.840" style="s2">also what you&#39;re talking about when you</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.890" end="01:28:52.090" style="s2">talk totally that&#39;s Christmas planning</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.840" end="01:28:55.270" style="s2">yeah yeah this brought that metaphor to</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.090" end="01:28:56.860" style="s2">the chapter we wrote in he played with</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.270" end="01:28:58.780" style="s2">the musicality in me well Chris you</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.860" end="01:29:00.190" style="s2">talked about it you know the in concert</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.780" end="01:29:02.380" style="s2">metaphor that you that you made</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.190" end="01:29:05.860" style="s2">throughout the chapter we just wrote</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.380" end="01:29:08.560" style="s2">yeah yeah which is ironic because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.860" end="01:29:10.990" style="s2">I&#39;m in in my tactile life I&#39;m not at all</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.560" end="01:29:13.150" style="s2">very musicals but it seemed to me that</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.990" end="01:29:16.150" style="s2">there was no more there was no more</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.150" end="01:29:19.570" style="s2">perfect analogy to play into the process</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.150" end="01:29:21.370" style="s2">because because because the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.570" end="01:29:23.260" style="s2">being able to I mean because it because</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.370" end="01:29:25.210" style="s2">it because it both because it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.260" end="01:29:27.520" style="s2">concentrated and distributed at the same</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.210" end="01:29:29.230" style="s2">time because a melody can recur and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.520" end="01:29:30.850" style="s2">because a melody can transform and a</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.230" end="01:29:37.660" style="s2">melody can be present in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.850" end="01:29:40.060" style="s2">different ways yeah it&#39;s just a most</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.660" end="01:29:42.250" style="s2">perfect go ahead John I just wanted that</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.060" end="01:29:43.780" style="s2">to the metaphor now and your metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.250" end="01:29:46.150" style="s2">you know and jamming you have to pick up</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.780" end="01:29:47.740" style="s2">on it you have to pick up on it but you</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.150" end="01:29:51.850" style="s2">have to get you have to get pick up on</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.740" end="01:29:53.380" style="s2">it and get caught up in it right and if</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.850" end="01:29:54.060" style="s2">you try and hold on to it too long you</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.380" end="01:29:56.470" style="s2">destroy it</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.060" end="01:29:59.080" style="s2">this is back again to this fate the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.470" end="01:30:00.730" style="s2">sense of faith you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.080" end="01:30:02.710" style="s2">getting picked up on it your your the</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.730" end="01:30:04.800" style="s2">continuity of contact you can continue</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.710" end="01:30:07.380" style="s2">to play the serious</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.800" end="01:30:09.510" style="s2">play and that&#39;s again the Socratic faith</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.380" end="01:30:12.210" style="s2">so we could actually add that to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.510" end="01:30:15.239" style="s2">two-year metaphor Chris I&#39;ve also notice</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.210" end="01:30:17.909" style="s2">notice that it starts off much more</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.239" end="01:30:20.460" style="s2">intellectual or more prosaic and a bit</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.909" end="01:30:22.710" style="s2">awkward and and in many directions and</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.460" end="01:30:25.469" style="s2">then we build towards this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.710" end="01:30:27.449" style="s2">Appeal is a factor it seems to happen in</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.469" end="01:30:29.130" style="s2">all these kind of conversations least</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.449" end="01:30:34.139" style="s2">ones I&#39;ve been having we build towards</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.130" end="01:30:36.360" style="s2">this we build up towards you know an</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.139" end="01:30:38.550" style="s2">insight and a static insight of some</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.360" end="01:30:40.050" style="s2">kind yep and I think that&#39;s the third</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.550" end="01:30:41.730" style="s2">factor that we were talking about that</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.050" end="01:30:45.389" style="s2">third factor where it takes on a life of</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.730" end="01:30:47.460" style="s2">its own and it instead of you pushing</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.389" end="01:30:49.139" style="s2">the conversation forward it takes on a</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.460" end="01:30:51.150" style="s2">life of its own and everybody has drawn</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.139" end="01:30:53.280" style="s2">up together forward in it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.150" end="01:30:56.010" style="s2">third factor it&#39;s like it&#39;s the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.280" end="01:30:58.139" style="s2">of the conversation it&#39;s the Geist yes</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.010" end="01:31:00.719" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re taught you&#39;re spoken by the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.139" end="01:31:05.699" style="s2">conversation so transgenders yes ejected</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.719" end="01:31:08.639" style="s2">sensation exactly this is why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.699" end="01:31:11.309" style="s2">logos and dialectic are so central not</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.639" end="01:31:13.770" style="s2">only to you know the the ongoing issue</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.309" end="01:31:17.369" style="s2">of the meeting crisis but inter for</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.770" end="01:31:20.639" style="s2">forgiving people the place and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.369" end="01:31:25.230" style="s2">presence and the and and the in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.639" end="01:31:27.360" style="s2">interlocutors ought to cultivate the</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.230" end="01:31:29.429" style="s2">kinds of responses we need right now in</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.360" end="01:31:31.619" style="s2">the face of what we&#39;re facing again</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.429" end="01:31:34.550" style="s2">Socrates was in Athens during the plague</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.619" end="01:31:38.730" style="s2">and while it was literally under siege</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.550" end="01:31:43.139" style="s2">so we all have to be Socrates well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.730" end="01:31:45.630" style="s2">in a way anyway we all else we only in a</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.139" end="01:31:48.000" style="s2">way I&#39;m sorry that felt very banal</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.630" end="01:31:50.340" style="s2">actually a banal statement it felt like</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.000" end="01:31:53.030" style="s2">a no no I&#39;m sorry I what he&#39;s even now</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.340" end="01:31:54.780" style="s2">advertising jingle or something well</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.030" end="01:31:56.460" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t want it to become</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.780" end="01:31:57.869" style="s2">trivialize but I want I would want to</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.460" end="01:31:59.309" style="s2">say we all have to become Socrates but</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.869" end="01:32:01.110" style="s2">also in the way in which we all have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.309" end="01:32:04.380" style="s2">become Siddhartha and we all have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.110" end="01:32:06.360" style="s2">become loud say and perhaps if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.380" end="01:32:09.030" style="s2">too sacrilegious given my previous</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.360" end="01:32:11.190" style="s2">invective but also have to become Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.030" end="01:32:13.199" style="s2">I mean you have to recover Socratic</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.190" end="01:32:15.719" style="s2">wisdom and faith we have to recover that</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.199" end="01:32:17.120" style="s2">Jesus is agape we have to recover loud</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.719" end="01:32:20.240" style="s2">says-- flow we have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.120" end="01:32:21.950" style="s2">recover you know sit harvest capacity</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.240" end="01:32:24.590" style="s2">for profound transformative the insight</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.950" end="01:32:27.200" style="s2">we need all of these now we needed all</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.590" end="01:32:29.030" style="s2">of these and if art you know if our</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.200" end="01:32:31.160" style="s2">musings about this stand outside of</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.030" end="01:32:33.320" style="s2">literalism which of course they do then</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.160" end="01:32:36.950" style="s2">then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.320" end="01:32:38.570" style="s2">we&#39;re blaspheming to say that that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.950" end="01:32:40.040" style="s2">have to I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.570" end="01:32:41.330" style="s2">a trivial statement and you just say</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.040" end="01:32:43.100" style="s2">that we have to be stocker cheese</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.330" end="01:32:45.770" style="s2">because the way that Socrates is</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.100" end="01:32:47.660" style="s2">Socrates you know I trust you&#39;ll both</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.770" end="01:32:52.070" style="s2">take this in in the intended meaning</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.660" end="01:32:54.050" style="s2">even Socrates is not Socrates yes yes so</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.070" end="01:32:55.730" style="s2">yeah in a way that&#39;s that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.050" end="01:32:57.860" style="s2">right we have to be Socrates in the way</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.730" end="01:32:59.900" style="s2">that Socrates is and is not Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.860" end="01:33:02.330" style="s2">precisely this isn&#39;t crazy says never</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.900" end="01:33:05.060" style="s2">beyond himself I hope that&#39;s not I hope</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.330" end="01:33:07.820" style="s2">that&#39;s not you reckon so that himself if</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.060" end="01:33:11.240" style="s2">he said what&#39;s that you know I&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.820" end="01:33:13.850" style="s2">you a Socrates more beautiful yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.240" end="01:33:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s right the historical Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.850" end="01:33:19.790" style="s2">because he was much more concerned to</p>

<p begin="01:33:19.790" end="01:33:26.030" style="s2">what Socrates was historically you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.670" end="01:33:29.450" style="s2">again instead of pursuing this to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.030" end="01:33:31.790" style="s2">historical certainty of Socrates Plato</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.450" end="01:33:34.340" style="s2">was much more interested in getting us</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.790" end="01:33:36.200" style="s2">to confront the truth of Socrates or the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.340" end="01:33:39.320" style="s2">SF arm of Socrates does it work</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.200" end="01:33:41.990" style="s2">there we go Andrew the essence the form</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.320" end="01:33:43.400" style="s2">and the truth of sanity&#39;s yes and we</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.990" end="01:33:46.010" style="s2">have to end this I was also thinking</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.400" end="01:33:48.590" style="s2">about the meaning of you know Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.010" end="01:33:51.170" style="s2">talks about imitation of Christ is is</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.590" end="01:33:58.280" style="s2">not imitating Christ&#39;s life but it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.170" end="01:34:01.880" style="s2">becoming more truly not ourselves but</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.280" end="01:34:04.280" style="s2">our I guess the again our divine double</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.880" end="01:34:07.040" style="s2">like you keep using that if bringing</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.280" end="01:34:08.540" style="s2">that that was it the my last question</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.040" end="01:34:10.670" style="s2">and that keeps coming up at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.540" end="01:34:13.430" style="s2">these conversations as well this notion</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.670" end="01:34:15.110" style="s2">of the divine double which I talked</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.430" end="01:34:18.200" style="s2">about with Zack as well and and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.110" end="01:34:21.980" style="s2">divine double being our potential and</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.200" end="01:34:24.340" style="s2">our plurality and it&#39;s enacted now I</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.980" end="01:34:28.280" style="s2">mean it&#39;s simple it&#39;s symbolically</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.340" end="01:34:31.480" style="s2">already active in how it calls us forth</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.280" end="01:34:35.990" style="s2">from our current self yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.480" end="01:34:37.610" style="s2">and yeah I think the I mean part of what</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.990" end="01:34:39.800" style="s2">I want to work on with Chris&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.610" end="01:34:42.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep connection between wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.800" end="01:34:45.920" style="s2">the sense of faith Socratic faith and</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.580" end="01:34:48.410" style="s2">being in the correct kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.920" end="01:34:51.320" style="s2">connectedness and identity with your</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.410" end="01:34:53.980" style="s2">sacred second self which which also is</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.320" end="01:34:56.060" style="s2">more or less which is which is very</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.980" end="01:34:59.960" style="s2">convergent with the idea of being in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.060" end="01:35:01.760" style="s2">right relation to your whole self in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.960" end="01:35:03.590" style="s2">Union sense of self right to find the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.760" end="01:35:05.210" style="s2">midpoint of personality that you in</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.590" end="01:35:07.850" style="s2">talks about to be in relation with</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.210" end="01:35:12.230" style="s2">yourself such that you&#39;re you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.850" end="01:35:14.990" style="s2">it&#39;s reciprocal and equilibrated spirit</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.230" end="01:35:17.930" style="s2">and transfer or I might say translucent</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.990" end="01:35:19.670" style="s2">for the distance distanced in just the</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.930" end="01:35:23.780" style="s2">right way that you are you are you are</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.670" end="01:35:25.460" style="s2">you are not susceptible to to two</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.780" end="01:35:29.990" style="s2">pathologies of inflation and over</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.460" end="01:35:32.530" style="s2">identification or God likeness but but</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.990" end="01:35:35.750" style="s2">that you are that you are positioned</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.530" end="01:35:37.610" style="s2">you&#39;re positioned you know in proportion</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.750" end="01:35:39.770" style="s2">to your to your psychic potential</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.610" end="01:35:42.260" style="s2">properly and I think that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.770" end="01:35:45.530" style="s2">very much very if not I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.260" end="01:35:48.110" style="s2">make an argument from exact identity</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.530" end="01:35:51.020" style="s2">here but I think I think the convergence</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.110" end="01:35:51.650" style="s2">is pretty unmistakable yeah I would</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.020" end="01:35:54.740" style="s2">agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.650" end="01:35:59.480" style="s2">I would agree with that mmm-hmm I should</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.740" end="01:36:01.400" style="s2">get going soon so but it&#39;s it is this</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.480" end="01:36:03.650" style="s2">sound this feels like what we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.400" end="01:36:05.330" style="s2">come to a culmination point in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.650" end="01:36:09.770" style="s2">conversation mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.330" end="01:36:12.920" style="s2">yeah what do you think does anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.770" end="01:36:16.040" style="s2">want to say anything or I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.920" end="01:36:17.780" style="s2">foreclose but I like I said I&#39;m already</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.040" end="01:36:20.420" style="s2">sort of half an hour past where I said I</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.780" end="01:36:23.060" style="s2">would yeah well I wouldn&#39;t end this I I</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.420" end="01:36:25.160" style="s2">would never end this it&#39;s such a great</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.060" end="01:36:28.100" style="s2">pleasure for me and I appreciate it so</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.160" end="01:36:30.500" style="s2">much but but there has to be an end</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.100" end="01:36:32.180" style="s2">somewhere so well it&#39;s one of the only</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.500" end="01:36:34.340" style="s2">things I like from Sartre you know he</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.180" end="01:36:35.630" style="s2">said you never we talked about books he</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.340" end="01:36:36.440" style="s2">said you never finished them you just</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.630" end="01:36:39.470" style="s2">abandon them</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.440" end="01:36:43.580" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think just abandon them</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.470" end="01:36:44.750" style="s2">because we have other cars the car</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.580" end="01:36:46.310" style="s2">station will continue in</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.750" end="01:36:48.820" style="s2">well that&#39;s part of what we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.310" end="01:36:52.040" style="s2">about towards the end in Austin yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.820" end="01:36:55.130" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s moving forward and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.040" end="01:36:56.690" style="s2">whatever it will become and I also there</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.130" end="01:37:00.950" style="s2">was one point in their conversation</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.690" end="01:37:03.530" style="s2">where I felt this is so important</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.950" end="01:37:06.560" style="s2">I just wish like one person out there</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.530" end="01:37:08.870" style="s2">could hear it there&#39;s just I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.560" end="01:37:10.040" style="s2">remember what the point was but but</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.870" end="01:37:12.290" style="s2">there&#39;s something really really</p>

<p begin="01:37:15.530" end="01:37:24.610" style="s2">getting a little little piece of that</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.570" end="01:37:26.960" style="s2">meaning could change everything I mean</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.610" end="01:37:28.880" style="s2">does that make any sense am I being too</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.960" end="01:37:30.710" style="s2">dramatic here no no no I think that&#39;s I</p>
