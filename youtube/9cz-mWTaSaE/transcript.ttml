<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:08.340" style="s2">so I&#39;m curious what brought up the game</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.730" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">beyond boring idea it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.340" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">the consequence of a series of micro</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">experiments I did with the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">group so first I thought okay that well</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">my interest right now is okay some</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:23.850" style="s2">people are interested in theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">about game B away in the future some</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">people are more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">transition what I want to focus on is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:32.130" style="s2">actually the actual scene the network of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">people that are here right what stage is</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:37.890" style="s2">impossible for us how can we become from</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">like a cloud of atoms more to an</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">organism you know like where people like</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">take on obviously in a distributed way</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.510" end="00:00:46.460" style="s2">like certain roles or provide some</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">services to each other you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.460" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">differentiation and the integration that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">so I started on Facebook asking the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">question what is your greatest</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">impediment to participating more</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">meaningful to game B so that was a poll</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">and I think the first two results were</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">time and money lack of time and lack of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:09.030" style="s2">money and then the third was I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">learning about the scene you know before</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.030" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">I can participate and Hitler and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">wondered okay the second question has to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">be like what can we actually solve long</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">short term because you know lack of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:24.090" style="s2">people&#39;s lack of money which correlated</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">highly with the lack of time you know I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.090" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">really succeeded that we can solve it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">I asked I made a second troll saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">okay well among like the solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">the previous factors you know which one</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">do you think we can solve more easily</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">then I kind of like cross like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.500" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">multiplied the two and so the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">place that looked like it would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">most leverage is the onboarding right</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">where the people like that still are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:51.140" style="s2">wondering what is this about what should</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.140" end="00:01:56.420" style="s2">how can I participate what are the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">opportunities the affordances and so on</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.420" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">get a way to do that in a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">quick way and so that that&#39;s then what</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">sparked they okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">I bought game P DOS guide the domain and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">but who knows maybe maybe it has to live</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">Wiki I don&#39;t know that&#39;s why I also</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">wanted to frame this in a more general</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:23.489" style="s2">way not like what should we do with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:25.349" style="s2">domain but more like okay what is a what</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.489" end="00:02:28.860" style="s2">is an optimal onboarding experience or</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.349" end="00:02:32.100" style="s2">maybe more even more generally what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.860" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">the process through which someone it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.100" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have to be a newbie can</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">become valuable participant to the scene</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">right what is it what is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">skill sets what are the experiences what</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">are the videos material resources link</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">and if I had to kind of like distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">that from any kind of that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">actually things to a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">Wendy I would want to distinguish that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">project from any kind of like library of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">theory or even beyond that you know like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:16.410" style="s2">bench making around you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:18.630" style="s2">transcriptions maybe or the wiki and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.410" end="00:03:22.049" style="s2">of that I would in a sense that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.630" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">bias like leer towards something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.049" end="00:03:27.030" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of linear you know like and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously just a guide is from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.030" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">guide of this I have some very strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:39.690" style="s2">feelings about this please so right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">there is no onboarding but people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.690" end="00:03:43.019" style="s2">finding it and they&#39;re finding ways to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:45.630" style="s2">collaborate and they&#39;re finding ways to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">participate and be engaged not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.630" end="00:03:54.739" style="s2">but there are some people who are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.100" end="00:03:58.650" style="s2">there is something that happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.739" end="00:04:01.019" style="s2">try and codify a process and people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.650" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">start to think that that is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.019" end="00:04:07.440" style="s2">it has to happen so let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:09.030" style="s2">example I&#39;ve been watching the game be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:11.340" style="s2">space since it was about or the game be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.030" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">Facebook group since it was about 300</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.340" end="00:04:16.380" style="s2">people and the first group of 300 people</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:19.229" style="s2">came together and they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.380" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">make sense of what game B was and there</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.229" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">was James Allen&#39;s on game B document</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.850" style="s2">that people were collaborating on and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:30.340" style="s2">this was an artifact that was Purdue</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.850" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">from a collaboration of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:38.340" style="s2">trying to make sense of the space so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:40.630" style="s2">that&#39;s what that was for and then they</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.340" end="00:04:42.430" style="s2">were networked with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.630" end="00:04:45.640" style="s2">went on to other collaborations and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.430" end="00:04:48.100" style="s2">that document kind of fell out of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.640" end="00:04:50.890" style="s2">hotspot of collaboration right so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.100" end="00:04:52.510" style="s2">kind of is what it is some people work</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.890" end="00:04:55.390" style="s2">on it from time to time but it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.510" end="00:04:56.950" style="s2">active as it used to be then we had</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.390" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">another way of a three to four hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.950" end="00:05:03.400" style="s2">people come into the game be Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">Arena and they were looking to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.400" end="00:05:07.420" style="s2">make sense of it as well except instead</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:10.420" style="s2">of having to figure it out all in their</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.420" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">own they had this artifact to look at of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.420" end="00:05:17.020" style="s2">what game B was so now you have this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.660" end="00:05:20.250" style="s2">intergenerational transition to where</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.020" end="00:05:23.740" style="s2">the original things that the people were</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.250" end="00:05:26.620" style="s2">trying to figure out about game B now</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.740" end="00:05:28.930" style="s2">it&#39;s they have this artifact to say what</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.620" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">game B is so there&#39;s this different</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.930" end="00:05:35.380" style="s2">perception that happens and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.060" style="s2">actually spoken with Zack Stein about</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.380" end="00:05:38.830" style="s2">this quite a bit I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">familiar with him but he&#39;s done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.830" end="00:05:44.590" style="s2">work on he has a book called education</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.130" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">in a time between worlds and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.590" end="00:05:50.440" style="s2">about the new education paradigm and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:54.670" style="s2">the conversation we&#39;ve had a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.440" end="00:05:58.030" style="s2">on was the difference that happens when</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.670" end="00:06:00.370" style="s2">people are wanting to find something out</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.030" end="00:06:03.010" style="s2">and they have the challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.370" end="00:06:05.230" style="s2">necessity of finding it out for</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.010" end="00:06:07.930" style="s2">themselves and charting their own path</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.230" end="00:06:10.620" style="s2">how that&#39;s a different experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.930" end="00:06:14.280" style="s2">having it given to you do this this this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.620" end="00:06:17.980" style="s2">so there&#39;s something in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.280" end="00:06:20.680" style="s2">working as game B or engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.980" end="00:06:22.900" style="s2">world in that sort of way that really</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.680" end="00:06:24.490" style="s2">kind of requires this incorporation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.900" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">doing it on your own and figuring it out</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.490" end="00:06:31.480" style="s2">it&#39;s almost as if the codification of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:35.140" style="s2">trying to take that shortcut diminishes</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.480" end="00:06:37.479" style="s2">something in the character development</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.140" end="00:06:39.550" style="s2">of the individual so that&#39;s that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.479" end="00:06:41.350" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.550" end="00:06:43.900" style="s2">because that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.350" end="00:07:02.920" style="s2">hard to articulate but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.900" end="00:07:07.510" style="s2">important that make sense so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.920" end="00:07:10.780" style="s2">codification is problematic it can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.510" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">yes particularly if it&#39;s trying to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.780" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">shortcut in some way because it almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.110" end="00:07:21.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the drive and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.510" end="00:07:24.490" style="s2">desire to figure things out that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.760" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">never figured out before that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.490" end="00:07:30.550" style="s2">important so making it too easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:42.580" style="s2">almost short circuits that and loses</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.550" end="00:07:45.430" style="s2">that aspect all right there is an image</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.580" end="00:07:48.880" style="s2">that I have in mind with which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.430" end="00:07:50.730" style="s2">know if it applies so I just mean just</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.880" end="00:07:53.110" style="s2">gonna share this so this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.730" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">standing on the shoulders of giants that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.110" end="00:07:58.990" style="s2">kind of thing right where there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.780" end="00:08:01.030" style="s2">work to do right we have to do the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.990" end="00:08:04.930" style="s2">step but kind of like the work that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.030" end="00:08:09.220" style="s2">Giants have done before helps you reach</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.930" end="00:08:12.250" style="s2">that point and I wonder if it applies</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.220" end="00:08:14.640" style="s2">and there is a sense in which or like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.250" end="00:08:19.690" style="s2">have the feeling that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.640" end="00:08:21.670" style="s2">in this new space where it doesn&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.690" end="00:08:25.600" style="s2">wondering then what is the contribution</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.670" end="00:08:28.690" style="s2">that we could make for newcomers or even</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.600" end="00:08:30.970" style="s2">for the people who are still wondering</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.690" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">how could I participate more if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.970" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">a codification well that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:41.380" style="s2">interesting part is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:42.910" style="s2">something that can help and there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.380" end="00:08:45.010" style="s2">standing on the shoulders of giants and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.910" end="00:08:47.020" style="s2">I think that that is very important but</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.010" end="00:08:49.870" style="s2">I also think that is important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.020" end="00:08:52.630" style="s2">preserve the fact that there is still</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.870" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">work to be done and we need people to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.630" end="00:08:57.949" style="s2">work on those things it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:09:02.350" style="s2">must all be unfinished it can never be</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.949" end="00:09:04.430" style="s2">finished right it it needs the constant</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.350" end="00:09:07.160" style="s2">input from people who have new</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.430" end="00:09:07.639" style="s2">perspectives and working on that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.160" end="00:09:10.430" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.639" end="00:09:12.019" style="s2">when when we go to a point and say well</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:15.649" style="s2">this is how it is and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.019" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">defined it then it starts to lose</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.649" end="00:09:22.130" style="s2">something so how do we do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:26.589" style="s2">that helps people but also preserves</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.130" end="00:09:30.769" style="s2">that sort of very important challenge</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.589" end="00:09:34.819" style="s2">right yeah I know you had something to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.769" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">say Wendy what was it I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.819" end="00:09:39.889" style="s2">now few thoughts I noticed a few</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:42.079" style="s2">concepts like I wanted to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.889" end="00:09:44.269" style="s2">there is I know that expression standing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.079" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">on the shoulders of giants um you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.269" end="00:09:48.079" style="s2">is used to describe yeah the you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:50.540" style="s2">scientific process and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.079" end="00:09:53.930" style="s2">research and advancing human knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.540" end="00:09:56.569" style="s2">know in one talk John for Vicki referred</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.930" end="00:09:58.670" style="s2">to science as um besides he said there</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.569" end="00:10:00.860" style="s2">is no solid ground you&#39;re lost at sea</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.670" end="00:10:02.750" style="s2">you know science is actually more like</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.860" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">sailing and there&#39;s sort of self you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.750" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">know sort of self-deception there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.220" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">deception everywhere you look and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">you know almost like you know rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:12.980" style="s2">than having this building engineering</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:14.750" style="s2">metaphor the scientific process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.980" end="00:10:16.370" style="s2">more of you know imagine you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.750" end="00:10:17.959" style="s2">somebody seeing you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.370" end="00:10:19.880" style="s2">seemingly ended feeling and you know on</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.959" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">the sea of water and the waters are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.880" end="00:10:25.339" style="s2">choppy and which that makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:27.589" style="s2">about the when there&#39;s come to people</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.339" end="00:10:29.690" style="s2">who say oh like what when they gather</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.589" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">you know Yacht Club&#39;s Steve is a sailor</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.690" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">soft but I&#39;m able to look at him for Co</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:37.819" style="s2">a metaphor it&#39;s like what is it that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:39.740" style="s2">look at others you know sailors often</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.819" end="00:10:41.240" style="s2">they each have their own boats but what</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.740" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">is it that they do together like they</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.240" end="00:10:46.790" style="s2">race together they gather and Clubhouse</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:49.459" style="s2">together of course you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.790" end="00:10:54.230" style="s2">sharing you know information all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.459" end="00:10:56.600" style="s2">time about the weather but it yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.230" end="00:10:57.860" style="s2">very very different from say how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.600" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">know you know people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.860" end="00:11:04.670" style="s2">building a bridge kind of come together</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:06.260" style="s2">and work so that that&#39;s one thing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.670" end="00:11:08.140" style="s2">then also to I guess the idea that like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.260" end="00:11:12.260" style="s2">idea means</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.140" end="00:11:14.930" style="s2">Balaji I don&#39;t know how to pronounce his</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.260" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">last name he&#39;s uh you know somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.930" end="00:11:22.400" style="s2">who&#39;s in venture capital and active on</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:24.830" style="s2">Twitter and involved the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.400" end="00:11:27.770" style="s2">currency scene I know he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.830" end="00:11:32.690" style="s2">that he&#39;s talked a bit about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.770" end="00:11:34.580" style="s2">the having you know kind of discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:36.200" style="s2">for mean if I&#39;m having the sense of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.580" end="00:11:37.700" style="s2">idea maze that you have your own idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.200" end="00:11:40.690" style="s2">maze that you were exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.700" end="00:11:44.060" style="s2">navigating like your own labyrinth and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.690" end="00:11:46.490" style="s2">and that that yeah having that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.060" end="00:11:49.310" style="s2">Questor journey of navigating the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.490" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">maze is sort of like perhaps like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.310" end="00:11:54.650" style="s2">the powerful frame for entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">I mean right now I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.650" end="00:11:58.250" style="s2">navigating this idea needs to figuring</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.440" style="s2">out what to do with like garbage and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.250" end="00:12:02.690" style="s2">recycling movie theater and when I put</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.440" end="00:12:05.000" style="s2">on this idea maze of like feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.690" end="00:12:06.470" style="s2">oh wait nobody nobody has really figured</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.000" end="00:12:08.360" style="s2">out the best way to handle all this</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.470" end="00:12:10.580" style="s2">stuff for a movie theater in Kingston</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.360" end="00:12:12.650" style="s2">like I&#39;m totally on uncharted territory</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.580" end="00:12:15.350" style="s2">here like this is unchartered territory</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.650" end="00:12:17.060" style="s2">this is my problem to kind of figure out</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.350" end="00:12:18.530" style="s2">and then maybe if I do actually figure</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.060" end="00:12:20.450" style="s2">out something good I can share the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.530" end="00:12:23.480" style="s2">solution maybe other businesses or how</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.450" end="00:12:25.970" style="s2">do I like yeah what what is there that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.480" end="00:12:27.470" style="s2">figure out that I then need to put in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.970" end="00:12:30.410" style="s2">conversation with other people to help</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.470" end="00:12:32.540" style="s2">other others like solve other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.410" end="00:12:34.790" style="s2">garbage recycling problems but there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.540" end="00:12:36.290" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t just solve my you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.790" end="00:12:38.570" style="s2">problem for the screening room and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.290" end="00:12:40.400" style="s2">sort of be done with it like that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.570" end="00:12:42.410" style="s2">feels too far too individualistic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.400" end="00:12:44.360" style="s2">that there&#39;s some there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.410" end="00:12:46.940" style="s2">problem solving that I might be doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.360" end="00:12:49.160" style="s2">that I maybe I do sort of solve the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.940" end="00:12:52.910" style="s2">problem in a way and other people can</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.160" end="00:12:56.870" style="s2">use that solution so yeah there is like</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.910" end="00:12:58.430" style="s2">this information yeah like anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.870" end="00:13:00.950" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what the point is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.430" end="00:13:06.290" style="s2">just putting those those those images on</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.950" end="00:13:09.110" style="s2">the table yeah that&#39;s yeah I get where</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.290" end="00:13:12.830" style="s2">it sits like this individualistic thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.110" end="00:13:16.220" style="s2">to just okay I solved the problem that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.830" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">it there&#39;s something to kind of evoke in</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.220" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">other people and try and help them do as</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:24.420" style="s2">well and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">I&#39;m really interested in you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.420" end="00:13:33.810" style="s2">preserving that and and the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:35.580" style="s2">see it is it&#39;s not about an individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.810" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">problem but there is a sort of a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.580" end="00:13:42.810" style="s2">engaging that we understand as a part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:44.459" style="s2">the game B and being attracted to it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.810" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">what what&#39;s brought us here and our our</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.459" end="00:13:48.540" style="s2">path forward here even the types of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:50.940" style="s2">things that we&#39;re taking on individually</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.540" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">whether it is the recycling thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.940" end="00:13:56.220" style="s2">locally or whether it is you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:14:00.279" style="s2">help people be in this space better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:02.829" style="s2">a how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.279" end="00:14:06.310" style="s2">not just teach people how to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.829" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">problem for themselves how to find those</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.310" end="00:14:11.470" style="s2">problems for themselves that they feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">like is theirs to take on and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.470" end="00:14:17.769" style="s2">cultivate the type of personality that</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:20.019" style="s2">can do that and also bring forward the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.769" end="00:14:21.879" style="s2">same thing right the same thing of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.019" end="00:14:25.329" style="s2">teaching other people to find their</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.879" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">thing to do right so we&#39;re standing on</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.329" end="00:14:28.420" style="s2">the shoulders of giants because we</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have to solve the problems</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.420" end="00:14:37.139" style="s2">that other people have already solved</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:39.249" style="s2">but how can we solve the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.139" end="00:14:45.069" style="s2">helping people learn how to be salt</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.249" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">problem solvers right like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.069" end="00:14:52.360" style="s2">preserve that sort of that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:54.249" style="s2">challenge that nature that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.360" end="00:14:56.649" style="s2">find these problems and solve them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.249" end="00:14:59.019" style="s2">like the the what is it the initiative</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.649" end="00:15:00.970" style="s2">that you had Nick to to come into this</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.019" end="00:15:03.129" style="s2">space and and want to do the onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.970" end="00:15:06.339" style="s2">thing the initiative that you have for</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.129" end="00:15:08.230" style="s2">me on how to solve the recycling thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.339" end="00:15:10.300" style="s2">within your space these are things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.230" end="00:15:12.759" style="s2">you recognize that are calling you how</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.300" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">do we help people identify that and take</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.759" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">those on and establish collaborations</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:24.279" style="s2">that teach the same sort of thing right</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:26.559" style="s2">mm-hmm so I feel like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.279" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">there we can grab on to it and help</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.559" end="00:15:30.939" style="s2">people learn that but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">really very straightforward as do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.939" end="00:15:37.509" style="s2">this and this check these boxes you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:41.620" style="s2">what I mean there is a sense of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.509" end="00:15:46.329" style="s2">to keep the center free something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.620" end="00:15:48.490" style="s2">that like okay we can add to the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.329" end="00:15:52.209" style="s2">but we should not put something in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.490" end="00:15:54.250" style="s2">center like gym rats manifesto idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.209" end="00:15:56.439" style="s2">fresh so that maybe there should be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.250" end="00:15:58.809" style="s2">number of manifestos all around and all</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.439" end="00:16:01.889" style="s2">from a specific perspective but there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.809" end="00:16:01.889" style="s2">no game D manifest</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.420" end="00:16:08.900" style="s2">and then of course people in the space</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.070" end="00:16:11.220" style="s2">who are just allergic to manifestos and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.900" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">then although part of it then is also</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.220" end="00:16:15.480" style="s2">actually it is sort of a cultural tone</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.190" style="s2">of saying that leg yes somebody can</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.480" end="00:16:19.560" style="s2">propose the manifesto and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.190" end="00:16:23.130" style="s2">can say I am allergic to manifestos and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.560" end="00:16:25.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you have to terms of if</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.130" end="00:16:28.080" style="s2">you&#39;re allergic to manifestos there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.620" end="00:16:29.580" style="s2">like you then have to like get off board</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.080" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">well it&#39;s funny I&#39;m just at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.580" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">onboarding and then off boarding I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:35.670" style="s2">what extent if there is onboarding does</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:37.860" style="s2">that then imply that there&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.670" end="00:16:42.540" style="s2">thing as like off boarding or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.860" end="00:16:44.670" style="s2">to get off of kicked out you know well I</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.540" end="00:16:48.140" style="s2">heard jordan&#39;s say if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.670" end="00:16:50.580" style="s2">play game B anymore just stop playing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.140" end="00:16:53.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know this whole it off boarding to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.580" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">that part but he&#39;s also said and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:17:01.890" style="s2">comes to mind now the thing that can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:04.290" style="s2">named is not the thing right so if if</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:07.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a process that we can name and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.290" end="00:17:09.620" style="s2">write out as step by step how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.050" end="00:17:12.650" style="s2">or what one needs to do then that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.620" end="00:17:16.190" style="s2">inherently doesn&#39;t capture it right</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.650" end="00:17:18.360" style="s2">there&#39;s there something more to it so</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.190" end="00:17:20.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s that that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.360" end="00:17:22.650" style="s2">challenge I see with the onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.100" end="00:17:26.360" style="s2">thing is how do you preserve that and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.650" end="00:17:32.940" style="s2">see this fallacy happen a lot where</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.360" end="00:17:34.980" style="s2">people go into a group and they have</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.940" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">trouble understanding what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.980" end="00:17:40.890" style="s2">there obviously yes we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">easier but in the process of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.890" end="00:17:47.220" style="s2">make it easier missing the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:52.760" style="s2">challenge in doing so with such a large</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.220" end="00:17:54.930" style="s2">part of it right so how do we keep that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.760" end="00:18:02.340" style="s2">at this point I&#39;m wondering what would</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.930" end="00:18:04.350" style="s2">be an anti onboarding well it did looks</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.340" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">like it give us the onboarding language</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.350" end="00:18:07.920" style="s2">like it makes me think of like a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:10.560" style="s2">boat and onboarding it makes me think of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.920" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">like a plank from like imagine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.560" end="00:18:14.370" style="s2">the dock so there&#39;s sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:14.930" style="s2">solid earth solid ground you walk out</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.370" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">onto the wood</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.930" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">dock and then there&#39;s this plank which</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">is the board you know which takes you on</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:23.990" style="s2">board the boat the boats floating on</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:25.430" style="s2">water and then at some point you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.990" end="00:18:26.990" style="s2">the board is going to be kind of cast</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.430" end="00:18:30.530" style="s2">aside and then the boat goes out to sea</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.990" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s many people sailing together</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.530" end="00:18:34.460" style="s2">on the boat and of course there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:36.470" style="s2">skipper or kind of a captain of the ship</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.460" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">and then you know and everybody kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.470" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">has these roles sort of sail the ship</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:47.870" style="s2">together and so is that first of all is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.540" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">that image more kind of game Amy what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.870" end="00:18:51.890" style="s2">gave me about that image is game be is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.000" end="00:18:55.070" style="s2">game be just like a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.890" end="00:18:56.030" style="s2">single-handedly like sailing their boats</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.070" end="00:18:58.730" style="s2">around together</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.030" end="00:19:00.650" style="s2">is it cruising or is it yeah everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.730" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">goes out and races and they come back</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.650" end="00:19:06.920" style="s2">and have drinks in the clubhouse like is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:09.590" style="s2">I think about like what a like on</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.920" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">boarding but the idea is almost like</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.590" end="00:19:13.190" style="s2">just saying that there is a board that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:14.390" style="s2">it&#39;s just saying to somebody who&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.190" end="00:19:16.310" style="s2">solid ground that you already have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.390" end="00:19:19.040" style="s2">ship like there is like a boat like</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.310" end="00:19:22.490" style="s2">there is a boat for you to sail in these</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.040" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">waters and you can go aboard that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.490" end="00:19:28.010" style="s2">boat but it&#39;s your boat to go aboard and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be simulated on your own</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.010" end="00:19:33.410" style="s2">but there&#39;s gonna be other people</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:35.060" style="s2">sailing with you and like there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.410" end="00:19:36.970" style="s2">something larger for you to participate</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.060" end="00:19:39.530" style="s2">and also to like the idea that like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.970" end="00:19:42.710" style="s2">in terms of that single-handed thing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.530" end="00:19:44.540" style="s2">is - I also want to avoid something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.710" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">not gave me as being lost at sea</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.540" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">completely by yourself like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:56.030" style="s2">the scene of somebody like on a raft by</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:58.580" style="s2">themselves no one around and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.030" end="00:20:00.050" style="s2">completely lost like that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.580" end="00:20:02.300" style="s2">it like there is something kind of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.050" end="00:20:04.940" style="s2">social and connected but yet again that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:07.100" style="s2">sovereignty maintaining thing so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.940" end="00:20:08.330" style="s2">kind of like what was ante on board he</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.100" end="00:20:10.580" style="s2">might have something to do with like</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.330" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">inviting people to board a ship but at</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.580" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">the same time like they&#39;re the they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:20.780" style="s2">the captains of that that ship so I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:26.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things that come up</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.780" end="00:20:27.130" style="s2">for me with that as I think that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.090" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.130" end="00:20:32.679" style="s2">to me that really sparks the need for an</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.450" style="s2">onboarding process is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.679" end="00:20:36.850" style="s2">joining and then they don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.450" end="00:20:39.429" style="s2">do they&#39;re curious they come to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.850" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">strange attractor and they&#39;re not sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.429" end="00:20:45.720" style="s2">how to engage or participate so trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:48.940" style="s2">to find some way to help them learn or</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:50.530" style="s2">find groups to collaborate with and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.940" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2">resonates with them and get to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.530" end="00:20:55.990" style="s2">other space I know Phil and Wendy you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.260" end="00:20:59.470" style="s2">both through different collaborations</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.990" end="00:21:02.049" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had you&#39;ve seen that the game</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.470" end="00:21:04.450" style="s2">be Facebook group is not all there is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.049" end="00:21:06.520" style="s2">it there&#39;s so much more outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.450" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">that people don&#39;t even see that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.520" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">on and a lot of this is collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:13.240" style="s2">that&#39;s in real life it&#39;s collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.919" style="s2">and other spaces it&#39;s just not taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.240" end="00:21:19.210" style="s2">place or being talked about right there</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.919" end="00:21:21.460" style="s2">so how can we open it up for people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.210" end="00:21:23.320" style="s2">are joining to know that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.460" end="00:21:26.700" style="s2">level of collaboration that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.320" end="00:21:29.350" style="s2">and understand how to get to that space</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.700" end="00:21:31.240" style="s2">we understand that rule Omega and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.350" end="00:21:33.000" style="s2">competent conversation is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.240" end="00:21:37.720" style="s2">prerequisites to be able to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.000" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">but where where do they go right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.720" end="00:21:41.470" style="s2">one of the conversations I was having</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">with Jim ROG about this new environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.470" end="00:21:45.730" style="s2">or form that that he&#39;s looking to build</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:48.039" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit larger than the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.730" end="00:21:50.230" style="s2">Facebook game B space or the game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.039" end="00:21:52.270" style="s2">Facebook page right because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.230" end="00:21:55.210" style="s2">really good for collaboration so how do</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.270" end="00:21:58.059" style="s2">we have these sorts of collaborations</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.210" end="00:22:00.100" style="s2">that are happening visible to people so</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.059" end="00:22:02.950" style="s2">that they can see what interests them</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.100" end="00:22:05.169" style="s2">and they can find ways to work to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.950" end="00:22:10.169" style="s2">into these different spaces which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.169" end="00:22:10.169" style="s2">active right and actually doing things</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.730" end="00:22:19.090" style="s2">something is becoming more and more like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.049" end="00:22:22.450" style="s2">vivid in my mind which is an experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.090" end="00:22:24.820" style="s2">I had as a child I went to public school</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.450" end="00:22:28.600" style="s2">for one year after which my mom then</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.820" end="00:22:31.390" style="s2">sent me to a Waldorf School I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.600" end="00:22:34.120" style="s2">if you&#39;re aware and I remember the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:36.850" style="s2">week being for the first time faced with</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.120" end="00:22:39.340" style="s2">with a white piece of paper completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.850" end="00:22:41.080" style="s2">blank no you know like things that were</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.340" end="00:22:44.650" style="s2">already drawn and I just had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.080" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">the colors right and I was completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.650" end="00:22:48.730" style="s2">frustrated as a child like what you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">what do I do with this is just white a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.730" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">white camera</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">and in a sense that was life-changing</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.470" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">that decision for me because I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:03.929" style="s2">completely fit for public school would</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">have felt like the straightest career or</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.929" end="00:23:07.909" style="s2">like ladder ever and instead I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.450" end="00:23:11.129" style="s2">forced with this</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.909" end="00:23:15.149" style="s2">creativity this initiative having to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.129" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">know fill the canvas so at this point</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.149" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering like how can we present</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">newcomers with the blank canvas</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.660" end="00:23:27.630" style="s2">what a lovely lovely description of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.520" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">experience thank you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.630" end="00:23:31.260" style="s2">do you remember though Nick how you fell</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">like what the white paper like did you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.260" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">did you quickly be like ah do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:36.150" style="s2">remember feeling liberated or feeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:39.180" style="s2">this is better and like do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.150" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">responding positively no no not at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.180" end="00:23:43.530" style="s2">as a child I mean I it was it took me</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:46.530" style="s2">weeks to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.530" end="00:23:48.060" style="s2">I was always complaining I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.530" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">go to this school I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.060" end="00:23:54.570" style="s2">my old school and the teacher was very</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:58.410" style="s2">patient and kind and guided me and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.570" end="00:24:00.090" style="s2">helped me I swear I was cutting</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.410" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">chuckling as you described it because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.090" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">went to a school that was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:05.820" style="s2">progressive and it&#39;s like a school that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:08.160" style="s2">wasn&#39;t me cultivating you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.820" end="00:24:10.620" style="s2">independent thought creativity although</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.160" end="00:24:13.080" style="s2">not probably not as normal extreme the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.620" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">Waldorf School I remember each morning</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.080" end="00:24:17.460" style="s2">there was kind of this free was drawing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:20.090" style="s2">activity and I remember we&#39;re told draw</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.460" end="00:24:22.440" style="s2">a picture and write three sentences and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.090" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">beyond that it could be whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.440" end="00:24:26.550" style="s2">and I arrived at the story that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.620" style="s2">thought it was great which was like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.550" end="00:24:30.600" style="s2">is a bunny the bunny is going for a walk</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.620" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">it is a sunny day and sometimes I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.600" end="00:24:34.920" style="s2">change it and make it a rainy day or</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.690" style="s2">swapping a dog but basically that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.920" end="00:24:38.490" style="s2">know this is an animal the animal was</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.690" end="00:24:41.490" style="s2">going for a walk and then here it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.490" end="00:24:44.220" style="s2">weather like that was my formula and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.490" end="00:24:46.620" style="s2">just drew that formula for like a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.220" end="00:24:52.590" style="s2">months every single morning and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.620" end="00:24:54.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve nailed it the teacher actually like</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.590" end="00:24:55.830" style="s2">we were doing like a parent-teacher</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.060" end="00:24:57.660" style="s2">night was like talking to my mom and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.830" end="00:24:59.430" style="s2">talking about this and said like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.660" end="00:25:00.450" style="s2">the idea here is to actually write a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.430" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">different story</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.450" end="00:25:04.440" style="s2">and draw something different every time</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:06.590" style="s2">not the same thing and there were like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.440" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">19</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.590" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">to mix it up and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:14.670" style="s2">what the problem is here this is a Greek</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.710" style="s2">story and I mean I did go on to actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.670" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">really like art and drawing and really</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.710" end="00:25:24.990" style="s2">would express myself through for drawing</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:27.210" style="s2">but yeah I don&#39;t know it is my in terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.990" end="00:25:28.470" style="s2">of like that system like some people</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.210" end="00:25:30.930" style="s2">like it is my in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.470" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">systemization or kind of reducing things</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.930" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">down to their essence or that repetition</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.740" style="s2">like sometimes that is what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:41.370" style="s2">soul saying rather than just like</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.740" end="00:25:43.860" style="s2">endless creativity endless you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.370" end="00:25:46.710" style="s2">endless organic growing garden like</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.860" end="00:25:49.290" style="s2">there is this urge to rationalize and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.710" end="00:25:51.450" style="s2">systematize and form you formula you</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.290" end="00:25:53.460" style="s2">know create formulas and that there can</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.450" end="00:25:54.750" style="s2">be this like intrinsic joy and creating</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.460" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">a formula and of course Nick your</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.750" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">programmer right like the creativity for</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:03.050" style="s2">you creativity is that creating the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:03.050" style="s2">system you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.130" end="00:26:08.190" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.030" end="00:26:15.900" style="s2">yeah not necessarily sticking to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.130" end="00:26:15.900" style="s2">system but yes creating the system</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.640" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">Hale happy to be here with you quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.610" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">overwhelmed at this point so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">autopsy but it&#39;s nice to come and see</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">you all and able to ease in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.790" end="00:26:48.540" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.070" end="00:26:50.760" style="s2">yeah just so that you know I already had</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.540" end="00:26:55.880" style="s2">a chat with field last week a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.760" end="00:27:05.610" style="s2">this onboarding but yeah I can&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.880" end="00:27:07.620" style="s2">get to the specifics so general you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.610" end="00:27:11.370" style="s2">refer to there being work you did say oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.620" end="00:27:14.730" style="s2">there is work to be done like find like</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.370" end="00:27:19.320" style="s2">within sort of the I guess sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.730" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">growing the the network say or in terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.320" end="00:27:23.040" style="s2">of dealing with somehow working with</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.500" style="s2">like new energy or need people coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.040" end="00:27:32.429" style="s2">you done what in your mind do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.500" end="00:27:36.299" style="s2">perceive as being yeah so last time I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.429" end="00:27:38.970" style="s2">was in California I had a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.299" end="00:27:43.169" style="s2">conversation with a guy named Kendrick</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.970" end="00:27:44.750" style="s2">and we were talking about how to grow</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.169" end="00:27:48.750" style="s2">these things we were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.750" end="00:27:52.169" style="s2">particular thing and new people coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.750" end="00:27:55.230" style="s2">in instead of indoctrinating them how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.169" end="00:27:57.450" style="s2">you incorporate what they know into what</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.230" end="00:28:01.710" style="s2">we know into like this sort of weaving</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:07.710" style="s2">into it as it grows right so that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.710" end="00:28:10.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t this core centralized idea that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.710" end="00:28:14.370" style="s2">crystallized this is how it works but</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.830" end="00:28:16.890" style="s2">that there is a seed and it&#39;s growth</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.370" end="00:28:19.770" style="s2">depends on the individuals bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.890" end="00:28:23.970" style="s2">their experiences in a particular manner</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.770" end="00:28:27.270" style="s2">like using rule Omega and and using this</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.970" end="00:28:29.220" style="s2">sort of non-rival this sort of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.270" end="00:28:30.930" style="s2">but leaving in their stories and their</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.220" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.930" end="00:28:35.370" style="s2">allowing those things to be brought in</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:42.470" style="s2">and how that makes everything grow out</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.370" end="00:28:42.470" style="s2">of it so maybe something is more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.460" end="00:28:50.210" style="s2">teaching people or onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.890" end="00:28:54.090" style="s2">encompassing how to engage in that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.210" end="00:28:56.250" style="s2">not what to engage in but how to engage</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.090" end="00:28:59.820" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s cultivating to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.250" end="00:29:05.340" style="s2">space right so maybe something even more</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.820" end="00:29:07.080" style="s2">meta I actually in terms of on the ante</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.340" end="00:29:08.670" style="s2">onboarding you&#39;re describing that made</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.080" end="00:29:10.290" style="s2">me imagine this image of the 17 or</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.670" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">onboarding I guess I think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.290" end="00:29:13.530" style="s2">traditional like organizational</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:15.150" style="s2">onboarding the ideas the person kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.530" end="00:29:16.980" style="s2">arrives as kind of this Lang slate that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.150" end="00:29:19.560" style="s2">needs to be indoctrinated or trained or</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.980" end="00:29:21.570" style="s2">oriented instead I&#39;m imagining this new</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.560" end="00:29:23.400" style="s2">person kind of entering this room and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.570" end="00:29:25.320" style="s2">then everyone kind of looks the thumb</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.400" end="00:29:27.660" style="s2">and be like maybe you know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.320" end="00:29:30.030" style="s2">what tell us what you oh you have what</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.030" end="00:29:33.330" style="s2">because that&#39;s gonna be a piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.530" end="00:29:35.130" style="s2">puzzle right like they&#39;re sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.330" end="00:29:37.110" style="s2">you start with this presumption that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.130" end="00:29:38.490" style="s2">this other person has has those piece of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.110" end="00:29:43.470" style="s2">the puzzle and they have this expertise</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.490" end="00:29:52.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost like yeah like okay take</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.470" end="00:29:55.920" style="s2">us to the next level sorry also my</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.560" end="00:29:58.680" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve had a lot of experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.920" end="00:30:00.810" style="s2">on cross-functional teams and research</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.680" end="00:30:05.610" style="s2">and development reverse engineering</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.810" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">rapid prototyping and I do not have any</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.610" end="00:30:09.570" style="s2">specialized degree in anything I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:12.300" style="s2">an engineer I don&#39;t have a PhD in any</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.570" end="00:30:17.130" style="s2">sort of thing but I was always a support</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.300" end="00:30:18.870" style="s2">type technician so I had so many</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.130" end="00:30:21.630" style="s2">wonderful experiences on these teams</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.870" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">with these incredibly brilliant people</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.630" end="00:30:27.180" style="s2">that had all these different answers and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:30.510" style="s2">ideas and I never knew what the hell was</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.180" end="00:30:32.700" style="s2">going on so being new on these teams</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.510" end="00:30:34.860" style="s2">being like less knowledgeable about</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.700" end="00:30:38.220" style="s2">what&#39;s happening what I learned was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.860" end="00:30:40.830" style="s2">my strengths was the questioning why do</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.220" end="00:30:43.860" style="s2">you do it this way what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.830" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">differently why don&#39;t we try this you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.860" end="00:30:46.800" style="s2">know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:50.310" style="s2">what types of things can we try what I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.800" end="00:30:52.350" style="s2">learned was the the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.310" end="00:30:55.050" style="s2">almost like the elders who have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.350" end="00:30:58.920" style="s2">sort of develops knowledge that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.050" end="00:31:02.580" style="s2">hold that&#39;s really important but they</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.920" end="00:31:05.640" style="s2">also to get that it comes at a cost it</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.580" end="00:31:09.270" style="s2">brings this sort of myopic view to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.640" end="00:31:11.100" style="s2">that deep of knowledge so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.270" end="00:31:13.410" style="s2">important to have new people come and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.100" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">ask these questions to help challenge</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.410" end="00:31:17.850" style="s2">that and bring out new perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:19.380" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;ve always brought</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.850" end="00:31:22.410" style="s2">to the teams that I was on in the past</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.380" end="00:31:24.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of what I see is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.410" end="00:31:26.520" style="s2">strength of new people coming in is so</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.390" end="00:31:28.890" style="s2">important otherwise you get into this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.520" end="00:31:32.270" style="s2">crystallized myopic view of how things</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.890" end="00:31:32.270" style="s2">should be and that becomes fragile</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:41.280" style="s2">strikes me that onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:45.920" style="s2">their own work maybe the great</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.280" end="00:31:45.920" style="s2">integrating is oh I like that one</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.250" end="00:31:55.520" style="s2">kind of like someone on a YouTube video</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.210" end="00:31:58.970" style="s2">made a super nice comment of like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.520" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">idea that as the tree grows it like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.970" end="00:32:05.150" style="s2">becomes more like world in a sense like</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:07.550" style="s2">the world becomes more 303 becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.150" end="00:32:10.670" style="s2">something like that like it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.550" end="00:32:16.400" style="s2">the seed that becomes bigger somehow I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.670" end="00:32:20.810" style="s2">don&#39;t know I like that and then there</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.400" end="00:32:24.230" style="s2">was something else for me that something</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.810" end="00:32:26.270" style="s2">that is this idea of anti onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.230" end="00:32:31.610" style="s2">evokes is actually a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.270" end="00:32:35.240" style="s2">withdrawing and maybe a bit something</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.610" end="00:32:36.860" style="s2">like I&#39;m becoming occult you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.240" end="00:32:40.910" style="s2">said there is a lot going on on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.860" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">ground maybe that&#39;s okay maybe Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.910" end="00:32:47.620" style="s2">should remain like this chatty loud</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:53.420" style="s2">place and the people who already will</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.620" end="00:32:55.310" style="s2">hear what&#39;s behind and reach out so one</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.420" end="00:32:57.680" style="s2">of the things that that we&#39;ve noticed or</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.310" end="00:33:00.770" style="s2">that that I&#39;ve been watching too and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.680" end="00:33:02.660" style="s2">this is unfortunate but I can understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.770" end="00:33:04.670" style="s2">why it&#39;s happening so as that first</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.660" end="00:33:06.350" style="s2">group of people began to find the groups</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.670" end="00:33:09.890" style="s2">that they resonated with and went on to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.350" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">collaboration further they were taken</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.890" end="00:33:15.290" style="s2">out of the Facebook group they they like</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:17.810" style="s2">their time was spent elsewhere not so</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.290" end="00:33:20.420" style="s2">much in that space so that means that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.810" end="00:33:23.690" style="s2">people who are most integrated into how</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.420" end="00:33:28.580" style="s2">to gain be outside of the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.690" end="00:33:30.340" style="s2">page are not really present to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.580" end="00:33:32.300" style="s2">that with people who are coming in</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.340" end="00:33:35.000" style="s2">especially as we&#39;ve been having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.300" end="00:33:38.630" style="s2">people come in really quickly compared</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.000" end="00:33:40.070" style="s2">to the early days of it so like even</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.630" end="00:33:42.860" style="s2">myself I don&#39;t get to spend a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.070" end="00:33:45.800" style="s2">of time in the face be faiths Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.860" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">group as I did before and certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.800" end="00:33:52.600" style="s2">in the collaborations in the manner that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:56.690" style="s2">I did and it&#39;s a lot larger group now</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.600" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s how do we you know kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.690" end="00:34:01.240" style="s2">that and that sort of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:03.140" style="s2">between people who are collaborating</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.240" end="00:34:06.140" style="s2">outside or underground</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.140" end="00:34:20.090" style="s2">with the people coming in how do we help</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.140" end="00:34:24.080" style="s2">them make that bridge right I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.090" end="00:34:26.179" style="s2">was listening to a podcast actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.080" end="00:34:28.669" style="s2">the podcast so uh Chris oh that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.179" end="00:34:29.929" style="s2">Christian I guess Christians start I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.669" end="00:34:33.830" style="s2">think all of you are familiar with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.929" end="00:34:35.869" style="s2">was him appearing on on it the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.830" end="00:34:38.090" style="s2">called an infinite path and it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.869" end="00:34:41.149" style="s2">very much like a spirituality and kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.090" end="00:34:44.210" style="s2">of sort of sort of a solo spiritual not</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.149" end="00:34:45.740" style="s2">solo sort of a spiritual journey outside</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.210" end="00:34:50.090" style="s2">of you know organized structure Piper</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.740" end="00:34:53.090" style="s2">type of podcast but he describes it in</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.090" end="00:34:54.830" style="s2">shift like uh but I guess when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.090" end="00:34:57.230" style="s2">to a certain kind of like those phases</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.830" end="00:34:58.850" style="s2">we sort of groups that allow for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.230" end="00:35:01.010" style="s2">certain kind of spiritual questing</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.850" end="00:35:03.109" style="s2">there&#39;s the there is a door they scrub</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.010" end="00:35:04.460" style="s2">like there is a door the door is there</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.109" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">and anyone can enter through the door</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.460" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">but like the door doesn&#39;t have a sign</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:11.510" style="s2">like it&#39;s not a business announcing</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">itself with a sign it&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.510" end="00:35:15.290" style="s2">door and Sarah you can walk through it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:18.020" style="s2">freely but nobody like nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.290" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">inviting you to the door and yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.020" end="00:35:21.980" style="s2">imagine a space or you know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:23.330" style="s2">believe the sort of idea maze where yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.980" end="00:35:25.070" style="s2">where there are doors so there are many</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.330" end="00:35:27.170" style="s2">doors and we&#39;re not the doors maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.070" end="00:35:33.950" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be advertised but they should</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.170" end="00:35:36.590" style="s2">be like visible and it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.950" end="00:35:38.300" style="s2">in a physical space you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.590" end="00:35:40.010" style="s2">physical space you can walk around you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.300" end="00:35:41.480" style="s2">can choose to kind of pay attention and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.010" end="00:35:44.630" style="s2">if you pay attention you will see the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.480" end="00:35:48.080" style="s2">doors on the buildings but in the online</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.630" end="00:35:51.530" style="s2">space you have to participate to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.080" end="00:35:53.450" style="s2">something visible right like a zoom is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.530" end="00:35:55.730" style="s2">not when it&#39;s it&#39;s empty it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.450" end="00:35:57.740" style="s2">nowhere right like the zoom room only</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.730" end="00:35:59.990" style="s2">exists when we&#39;re in it right like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.740" end="00:36:03.050" style="s2">zoom is not visible if there&#39;s no one in</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.990" end="00:36:04.760" style="s2">it there&#39;s no door right so like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.050" end="00:36:07.400" style="s2">this it just makes me think of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.760" end="00:36:10.970" style="s2">of new way what would be some new way in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.400" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">this odd virtual online realm for there</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.970" end="00:36:15.740" style="s2">you know like what do those stores look</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">like or how can people are even showing</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.740" end="00:36:18.260" style="s2">people how</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:19.309" style="s2">recognize doors I think the doors maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.260" end="00:36:20.990" style="s2">they&#39;re already there it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.309" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">building the doors it&#39;s about like</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.990" end="00:36:24.799" style="s2">almost sort of it as some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:27.079" style="s2">encourage like encouragement or but</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.799" end="00:36:28.549" style="s2">clues or hints or you know telling</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.079" end="00:36:31.309" style="s2">people how to look for doors that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.549" end="00:36:32.900" style="s2">could walk through and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.309" end="00:36:34.700" style="s2">things that I&#39;m really drawn to and why</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.900" end="00:36:39.319" style="s2">I show up and participate in the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.700" end="00:36:41.750" style="s2">that I do I really like anything that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.319" end="00:36:44.599" style="s2">seems to be a hint of collaboration that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.750" end="00:36:47.779" style="s2">somebody wants to do I&#39;m really keen on</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.599" end="00:36:49.430" style="s2">trying to find a way to instantiate that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.779" end="00:36:51.980" style="s2">and bring the group together because</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.430" end="00:36:54.440" style="s2">what I see is it&#39;s in groups like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.980" end="00:36:56.690" style="s2">where people get to know each other and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.440" end="00:36:59.799" style="s2">establish those relationships and are</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.690" end="00:37:03.170" style="s2">able to pass through that doorway right</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.799" end="00:37:05.150" style="s2">there are multiple things that that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.170" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve collaborated collaborated on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.150" end="00:37:10.819" style="s2">I&#39;ve collaborated on where this thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:13.670" style="s2">itself doesn&#39;t seem that important but</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.819" end="00:37:15.230" style="s2">what happens after you know once you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.670" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">walk through that initial door and say</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.230" end="00:37:20.569" style="s2">yes I want to show up and collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:24.710" style="s2">what can I do right once you get to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.569" end="00:37:27.109" style="s2">space and it&#39;s almost this this personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.710" end="00:37:30.980" style="s2">transition of the act of walking through</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.109" end="00:37:32.869" style="s2">the door right that that changes your</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.980" end="00:37:36.799" style="s2">ability to interact with people and how</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.869" end="00:37:38.359" style="s2">they interact with you so yeah I agreed</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.799" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">that the door should be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.359" end="00:37:42.980" style="s2">visible and I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:44.359" style="s2">things that the game be Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.980" end="00:37:48.680" style="s2">is really struggling with because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.359" end="00:37:50.150" style="s2">not so clear where you go after that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.680" end="00:38:02.809" style="s2">get to the game be Facebook group page</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.150" end="00:38:05.420" style="s2">then what right cause you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.809" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">physically impressive it feels much more</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.420" end="00:38:08.150" style="s2">intimate</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:11.319" style="s2">I think the gap so I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.150" end="00:38:17.059" style="s2">question would be how do we increase</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.319" end="00:38:20.020" style="s2">something like this I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.059" end="00:38:20.020" style="s2">someone who is like</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.060" style="s2">so I had one of these in Costco this</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:46.030" style="s2">let&#39;s check it&#39;s gonna zoom and it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.810" end="00:38:50.140" style="s2">very quick close like oh yes sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.030" end="00:38:50.620" style="s2">someone who wants to help yeah that make</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.140" end="00:38:53.110" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.620" end="00:38:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like these are type of pathways</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.110" end="00:39:00.190" style="s2">that I agree on I see but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.120" end="00:39:01.360" style="s2">increase these type of interactions</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.190" end="00:39:04.510" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of hard could we have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.360" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">thousand people know like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.510" end="00:39:12.220" style="s2">know who questioned I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:13.960" style="s2">acceptable to say that a large part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.220" end="00:39:16.660" style="s2">those people won&#39;t get to that space</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.960" end="00:39:19.570" style="s2">people go to the game be space for lots</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.660" end="00:39:23.530" style="s2">of different reasons and it&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.570" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">if that challenge is necessary to sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.530" end="00:39:28.150" style="s2">out people who really aren&#39;t sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:30.970" style="s2">whether or not they&#39;re ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.150" end="00:39:32.950" style="s2">through the door right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.970" end="00:39:37.330" style="s2">something to that that I feel is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.950" end="00:39:38.550" style="s2">important but my experience and one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.330" end="00:39:41.770" style="s2">the things that I wish that I could</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.550" end="00:39:45.490" style="s2">really explain to people in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.770" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">space is that just showing up there</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.490" end="00:39:50.260" style="s2">finding people you resonate with just</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">getting into a zoom call about something</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.260" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">that&#39;s how you really start to establish</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.530" style="s2">those relationships and connections</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:58.510" style="s2">that&#39;s how I get to know people and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.530" end="00:39:59.470" style="s2">even going further beyond that through</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.510" end="00:40:02.620" style="s2">that pathway</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.470" end="00:40:05.080" style="s2">I have physically met people from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.620" end="00:40:07.360" style="s2">game be space and become yeah bill I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.080" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">met you a couple of times you know and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.360" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">I&#39;m looking to go out to where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">Wendy and and hopefully I get to do that</p>

<p begin="00:40:19.750" end="00:40:24.450" style="s2">find who that is and then move on to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.970" end="00:40:27.070" style="s2">this in real life sort of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.450" end="00:40:29.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would be interested in if</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.070" end="00:40:32.580" style="s2">if there was a sort of I guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.160" end="00:40:35.110" style="s2">integration sort of aspect that also I</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.580" end="00:40:35.740" style="s2">think actually there just the existence</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.430" end="00:41:27.990" style="s2">videos where you&#39;re just talking to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:30.790" style="s2">camera and you&#39;re just practice speaking</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.990" end="00:41:37.990" style="s2">to the camera and uploading it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.790" end="00:41:39.849" style="s2">YouTube so I&#39;m this is day three you</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.530" end="00:41:47.140" style="s2">few times he originally did it a few how</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.810" end="00:41:49.510" style="s2">many years ago yeah that was like two</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.140" end="00:41:52.180" style="s2">two years ago in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.510" end="00:41:54.280" style="s2">Jordan Peterson wave I wanted to read</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.180" end="00:41:56.710" style="s2">all the books that he recommends and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:41:58.300" style="s2">then talk about them and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.710" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">started a YouTube channel but it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.300" end="00:42:02.710" style="s2">taking me weeks and months to read the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:04.150" style="s2">books and then whenever I was standing</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.710" end="00:42:07.060" style="s2">in front of my camera was feeling so</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.150" end="00:42:08.500" style="s2">awkward and then I said okay I need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.060" end="00:42:11.020" style="s2">do something about it and then I gave</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.500" end="00:42:12.730" style="s2">myself it&#39;s 30 days speaking challenge</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:14.650" style="s2">where I will basically forcing myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.730" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">like force it recording myself for five</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.650" end="00:42:18.010" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:20.200" style="s2">unprepared without even knowing what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.010" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">would talk about and upload it to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.200" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">YouTube and that&#39;s how my you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:29.980" style="s2">online not I for sure my youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:34.030" style="s2">got kick-started that way and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.980" end="00:42:36.280" style="s2">to become way more comfortable in front</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.030" end="00:42:38.680" style="s2">of the camera without the frame without</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.280" end="00:42:42.970" style="s2">being prepared in that in that sense and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.680" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">so it was beneficial and and these three</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.970" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">days ago or five days ago I said why not</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.780" style="s2">do it again you know like two years have</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:53.579" style="s2">passed and so on</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.780" end="00:42:55.750" style="s2">and Wendy started her own challenge yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.579" end="00:42:57.250" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s funny I knew you had done</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.750" end="00:42:58.990" style="s2">the speaking challenge but it was only</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.250" end="00:43:00.730" style="s2">through you doing it again more recently</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.990" end="00:43:02.829" style="s2">that I was like oh I could you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.730" end="00:43:05.140" style="s2">resurrected the idea and I&#39;m like oh I I</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.829" end="00:43:06.520" style="s2">should do this too I think this is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.140" end="00:43:09.430" style="s2">is something that I can do right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.520" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2">with my time constraints and this yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.430" end="00:43:14.260" style="s2">felt like in terms of my own leverage</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:17.800" style="s2">points and increase improving my</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.260" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">expressive capacity as well as being</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.800" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">comfortable with the vulnerability of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:26.710" style="s2">putting yourself on YouTube I thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:29.020" style="s2">like okay if I can like widen that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.710" end="00:43:30.520" style="s2">bottleneck for me I felt like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.020" end="00:43:33.880" style="s2">that&#39;s leverage points a wide that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.520" end="00:43:35.619" style="s2">some kind of widening but yeah I did</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.880" end="00:43:37.329" style="s2">yeah in my in my mind I do kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.619" end="00:43:38.770" style="s2">imagine like oh if the game beat like do</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.329" end="00:43:40.180" style="s2">the accept that the game the scene</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.770" end="00:43:43.150" style="s2">couldn&#39;t like very much actually just</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.180" end="00:43:46.119" style="s2">migrated to you like some like mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.150" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">Network / zoom and YouTube like in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.119" end="00:43:50.349" style="s2">mind that that seems good but of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:52.210" style="s2">text like text does have a role but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.349" end="00:43:55.720" style="s2">yeah I do imagine just some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.210" end="00:43:57.790" style="s2">almost flipping of of habits when it</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.720" end="00:44:03.069" style="s2">comes to the habits of writing out your</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.790" end="00:44:05.109" style="s2">thoughts versus speaking them I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.069" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">of moving more to it like an aural yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.109" end="00:44:10.540" style="s2">just thinking about like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:13.349" style="s2">powers of kind of like oral culture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.540" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">well I&#39;m working the transcription a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.349" end="00:44:19.510" style="s2">world that we&#39;ve been involved in as of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:22.869" style="s2">late it&#39;s very stark the difference</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.510" end="00:44:26.500" style="s2">between the oral world in the written</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.869" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">world so very different in the structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.500" end="00:44:33.099" style="s2">of thoughts and engaging people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:37.510" style="s2">one of the hardest things I find</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.099" end="00:44:39.940" style="s2">translating the spoken conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.510" end="00:44:43.809" style="s2">written conversation there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.940" end="00:44:50.500" style="s2">nuance in in the conversation that just</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.809" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">reading it as being like kind of a light</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.500" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">motif of our group right when to switch</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">to video from the written form</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">but there is something that is bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.420" end="00:45:04.290" style="s2">over to the written form at least with</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.340" end="00:45:06.750" style="s2">us which is when things are not going</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.290" end="00:45:08.910" style="s2">well we know we know that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.750" end="00:45:12.600" style="s2">back to this and fix things you know now</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.910" end="00:45:15.600" style="s2">we have this shared understanding which</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:16.860" style="s2">maybe allows us to be a bit more risky</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.600" end="00:45:18.600" style="s2">or it would allow us</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.860" end="00:45:20.520" style="s2">I am Not sure that we actually exploited</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.600" end="00:45:23.430" style="s2">that but I think that that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.520" end="00:45:26.850" style="s2">actually we&#39;ve been through the emotions</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.430" end="00:45:29.550" style="s2">enough time that yeah maybe some tension</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.850" end="00:45:32.370" style="s2">arises but then we can go and in a city</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.550" end="00:45:36.870" style="s2">Nicole and really like it I like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.370" end="00:45:39.890" style="s2">know fix the thing in a way faster so</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.870" end="00:45:43.970" style="s2">that&#39;s from sovereignty right some skill</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.250" end="00:46:39.120" style="s2">you actually need to change mediums you</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.900" end="00:46:40.980" style="s2">need to change conversation spaces</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.120" end="00:46:42.420" style="s2">YouTube you know you&#39;re to clearly have</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.980" end="00:46:45.150" style="s2">something to kind communicate to each</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.420" end="00:46:47.580" style="s2">other and then it&#39;s sort of forcing this</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.150" end="00:46:52.950" style="s2">medium where yeah it&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.580" end="00:46:54.570" style="s2">different kind of understanding another</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.950" end="00:46:56.760" style="s2">feature could be like that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.570" end="00:46:59.790" style="s2">there is a sovereignty ruler that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.760" end="00:47:01.140" style="s2">have to kind of set after every written</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.790" end="00:47:03.150" style="s2">message you know like I wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.140" end="00:47:08.870" style="s2">message but I don&#39;t feel so sovereign or</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.150" end="00:47:08.870" style="s2">enter the message end this over to 11:00</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.240" end="00:47:18.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll make a trippin off soon but I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.610" end="00:47:21.410" style="s2">to share one final thought thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.600" end="00:47:24.150" style="s2">lot about around like fitness landscape</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.410" end="00:47:27.060" style="s2">so like how would it onboarding fictive</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.150" end="00:47:31.350" style="s2">okay that&#39;s kept us safe and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.060" end="00:47:34.980" style="s2">imagining like most other kinds of going</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.350" end="00:47:37.410" style="s2">through to Facebook Facebook group and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.980" end="00:47:40.320" style="s2">then that that would generally mean that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.410" end="00:47:42.420" style="s2">maybe this group should be like looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.320" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">at the onboarding on specifically on</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.420" end="00:47:47.550" style="s2">Facebook so like what are the questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">that people are answering the three</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.550" end="00:47:55.740" style="s2">questions right now maybe we want more</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:58.710" style="s2">of you or less or are were the units</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.740" end="00:48:02.070" style="s2">currently it&#39;s like Facebook isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.710" end="00:48:03.690" style="s2">best platform but it might make sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.070" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">like build off of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.690" end="00:48:09.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I remember messaging</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:13.590" style="s2">touring about this before let&#39;s fill the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.960" end="00:48:15.830" style="s2">onboarding process on the Facebook I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.590" end="00:48:22.080" style="s2">not sure where that went</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.830" end="00:48:24.690" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s just some thought or at</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.080" end="00:48:27.060" style="s2">least like game B wiki canopy guide can</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.690" end="00:48:35.060" style="s2">be a link that people can see very early</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.060" end="00:48:37.470" style="s2">on if you want to but it does seem like</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.060" end="00:48:40.380" style="s2">if you are going to a Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.470" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">they&#39;re the for all funneling into there</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.380" end="00:48:50.130" style="s2">then something attached to these yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:53.700" style="s2">that&#39;s something I I&#39;d be happy to ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.130" end="00:48:55.230" style="s2">the admin group so yeah if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.700" end="00:48:56.940" style="s2">something that we can do with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.230" end="00:48:58.830" style="s2">questions that might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.940" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">more helpful even I know they have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.830" end="00:49:05.010" style="s2">couple of units that you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:06.420" style="s2">through in the group like lessons maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.010" end="00:49:11.250" style="s2">there&#39;s something that we can do in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.420" end="00:49:13.730" style="s2">space that that will help people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.250" end="00:49:16.770" style="s2">come in just get some orientation I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.730" end="00:49:18.150" style="s2">think I think we have I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.770" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">excellent help figure out some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.150" end="00:49:23.140" style="s2">principle which is like Texas great</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.940" style="s2">trying to get video calls and maybe</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.940" end="00:49:32.100" style="s2">or added as a principle because I&#39;ve</p>
