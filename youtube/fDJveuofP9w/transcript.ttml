<p begin="00:00:54.630" end="00:00:59.400" style="s2">wormhole series I&#39;ve been running and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.989" end="00:01:01.190" style="s2">the idea behind these series is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.400" end="00:01:03.739" style="s2">basically bring the in-person</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.190" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">toronto-based and flexural explorers</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:23.240" style="s2">think at least amongst these sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:26.270" style="s2">making circles needs no introduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.240" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">so how this is going to work today</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.270" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">for the first 60 minutes we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">have a Q&amp;A with John so I&#39;ll start off</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:39.330" style="s2">asking a question and then whoever feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:43.100" style="s2">called to ask them a question maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.330" end="00:01:45.990" style="s2">can raise your hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.100" end="00:01:49.970" style="s2">Narayan could you explain how to raise</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.990" end="00:01:52.530" style="s2">your hand and zoom what keys to push</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.970" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">yeah um if you&#39;re on a Windows computer</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.530" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">you can press alt Y if you&#39;re on a Mac</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:01:59.400" style="s2">you can press option Y and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:02.040" style="s2">actually just notify Peter the host that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.400" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">you would like to speak I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.040" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s anything that you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">that your hand is raised but if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.549" style="s2">decide to unraised your hand you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:11.100" style="s2">just press alt Y again and it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.549" end="00:02:12.570" style="s2">unraised it right and so I can see if</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.100" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">someone raises their hand and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.570" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">you&#39;re raising your hand and nothing&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.919" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">dialogues you&#39;ve been engaging in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like I can sense that you&#39;re really</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">but also on the letter exchange that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:35.609" style="s2">haven&#39;t with Dave Chapman so I just want</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:37.739" style="s2">to say I really appreciate that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.609" end="00:03:41.209" style="s2">doing that oh well thank you for that</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.209" end="00:03:47.430" style="s2">yeah the what I was agreeing with was</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">that the dialoguing with others parts</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.430" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">has grown like really considerably and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:57.870" style="s2">and I have and in sort of in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">correlated fashion I have grown an</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.870" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">appreciation for it I&#39;m gonna come to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">see it as as crucial to what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">to do to the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:14.010" style="s2">argumentative lecture series format I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">see the the more spontaneous dialoguing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.010" end="00:04:21.650" style="s2">as also doing a lot of the important</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">work at getting ideas developed and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.650" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">connecting people in the right way so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">I&#39;m very I&#39;m very happy about that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:31.860" style="s2">is sort of taken off and I hope I hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:33.090" style="s2">to get better at it because it&#39;s I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.860" end="00:04:35.610" style="s2">want to and you&#39;re helping me with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.090" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to learn a lot of skills</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.610" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">about this you know back into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:43.410" style="s2">philosophical heritage but also part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">some of the cutting-edge innovators</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.410" end="00:04:52.440" style="s2">right now and try and get something</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">integrated between them right so the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.440" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">theme thay is wisdom and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">question that you chose is what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:01.080" style="s2">wisdom today I kind of like had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:03.420" style="s2">I want to ask a really annoying question</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.080" end="00:05:04.590" style="s2">like what is the wisest definition of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.420" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">wisdom or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.590" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">but maybe like what is your requirement</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.890" end="00:05:11.480" style="s2">like working definition of wisdom maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">we can start there</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.480" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">well there&#39;s that&#39;s a hard question to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:18.690" style="s2">answer because I&#39;m right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:21.240" style="s2">actually working on it was sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.690" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">might call an official definition with</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.240" end="00:05:27.030" style="s2">Igor start with Igor Grossman and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.910" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">Michele Ferrari and some other people we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.030" end="00:05:32.010" style="s2">did Toronto wisdom task force a while</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">back and the survey of all the major</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.010" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">researchers in the field and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">and a long period of discussion it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.110" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">my channel if you want to sit down for</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:44.940" style="s2">like eight hours with not very good</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">audio and watch it but um and we&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.940" end="00:05:50.730" style="s2">there is an emerging consensus about</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.250" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2">that now that&#39;s not finished and because</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.730" end="00:05:59.970" style="s2">of that I I&#39;m not it&#39;s not quite right</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2">so I have sort of two definitions in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.970" end="00:06:02.820" style="s2">mind there&#39;s that one that I&#39;m that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.500" end="00:06:04.350" style="s2">we&#39;re all working towards collectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.820" end="00:06:05.970" style="s2">and there&#39;s one that I&#39;ve worked for</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.350" end="00:06:07.890" style="s2">I&#39;ve sort of come up with in the past</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.970" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">and so I&#39;m gonna transverse split the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.890" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">difference the one in the past was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:12.660" style="s2">notion of wisdom as rationally</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:15.270" style="s2">self-transcending rationality where</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.660" end="00:06:19.230" style="s2">rationality is much broader than it used</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.270" end="00:06:21.540" style="s2">to mean you know it&#39;s tend to it is tend</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.230" end="00:06:24.090" style="s2">to met the intentional manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.540" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">belief by adhering to logical norms and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.090" end="00:06:28.020" style="s2">evidential norms and something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:29.669" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it is to be rational and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.020" end="00:06:31.320" style="s2">I argue and I&#39;m making this argument</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.669" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">right now in the videos here is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.320" end="00:06:37.230" style="s2">that is too impoverished do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:39.660" style="s2">truncated a notion of rationality it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.230" end="00:06:41.160" style="s2">can&#39;t account for the connections</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:45.419" style="s2">between rationality and wisdom that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.160" end="00:06:48.030" style="s2">so central in the ancient world it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.419" end="00:06:51.110" style="s2">it can&#39;t account for the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.030" end="00:06:54.030" style="s2">amount of transformative experience or</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.110" end="00:06:56.669" style="s2">aspiration to use la Paul&#39;s ideas or I</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.669" end="00:07:03.720" style="s2">become rational and - and - and to be</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.720" end="00:07:09.600" style="s2">rational way of life and so when I say</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.589" end="00:07:42.369" style="s2">mindfulness meditation for example is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.839" end="00:07:44.469" style="s2">very good at becoming how self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.369" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">works within how attention is sculpting</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.469" end="00:07:50.189" style="s2">your salience landscape internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:53.319" style="s2">the sage is a very important practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.189" end="00:07:56.919" style="s2">for aspirational rationality and for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.319" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">becoming aware of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.919" end="00:08:01.629" style="s2">perspectives and trying to grow outside</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:04.509" style="s2">of the biases found within your own ego</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.629" end="00:08:06.969" style="s2">centric perspective so what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.509" end="00:08:08.919" style="s2">to say is that I think all of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.969" end="00:08:10.389" style="s2">various forms of rationality that zero</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.919" end="00:08:13.119" style="s2">in on particular kinds of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.389" end="00:08:15.519" style="s2">and the and the self-deception that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.119" end="00:08:17.349" style="s2">found where where they&#39;re in tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.519" end="00:08:19.719" style="s2">very strong for that particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.349" end="00:08:21.180" style="s2">knowing and tend to be weak or even</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.719" end="00:08:24.629" style="s2">interfering with other kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.180" end="00:08:27.999" style="s2">so for example if you don&#39;t constrain</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.629" end="00:08:29.529" style="s2">the part of your knowing that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.999" end="00:08:31.029" style="s2">with sort of the insight when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.529" end="00:08:33.069" style="s2">making inferences and going through an</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.029" end="00:08:35.319" style="s2">argument you will tend to leap to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.069" end="00:08:35.860" style="s2">conclusions often and that&#39;s how a bias</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.319" end="00:08:37.779" style="s2">gets in</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.860" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">you&#39;ll make a leap to conclusions so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.779" end="00:08:42.130" style="s2">insight machinery is inappropriately</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">operated and you do this sort of leaping</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.130" end="00:08:46.209" style="s2">that&#39;s really central to insight but you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:49.389" style="s2">leap to the wrong conclusion in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.209" end="00:08:51.130" style="s2">argument but if I&#39;m trying to generate</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.389" end="00:08:52.930" style="s2">an insight think about what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.130" end="00:08:55.329" style="s2">do in mindfulness and think about where</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.930" end="00:08:57.880" style="s2">you might need an insight like in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.329" end="00:09:00.759" style="s2">therapy I often have to shut off that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.880" end="00:09:02.170" style="s2">inferential processing so that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.759" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t keep interfering with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.170" end="00:09:06.449" style="s2">attentional processing that is needed it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">needs to come into a kind of dynamics or</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.449" end="00:09:11.319" style="s2">self-organization and so I can get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:12.610" style="s2">insight that I need so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.319" end="00:09:14.410" style="s2">give you an idea here that there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.610" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.410" end="00:09:19.330" style="s2">sacred technologies and what they tend</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:22.420" style="s2">to do is they tend to cause one form of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.330" end="00:09:25.030" style="s2">knowing to flourish by helping it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.420" end="00:09:27.400" style="s2">overcome the patterns of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.030" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">within it but they give it gets too</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.400" end="00:09:31.900" style="s2">imperialistic if you&#39;ll allow math that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">term it will interfere raita can tend to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.900" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">interfere with other forms of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:37.750" style="s2">and so these things tend to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:39.580" style="s2">checks-and-balances relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.750" end="00:09:41.530" style="s2">mindfulness tends to enhance intentional</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.580" end="00:09:43.540" style="s2">process and shuts off inferential</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.530" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">processing active open-mindedness tends</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.540" end="00:09:50.110" style="s2">to write enhance inferential processing</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:51.220" style="s2">diminish insight processing and and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.110" end="00:09:53.800" style="s2">your you know and then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.220" end="00:09:56.890" style="s2">also need psycho tech that balances</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.800" end="00:09:59.020" style="s2">between them so if you think that what</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.890" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">rationality is about what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.020" end="00:10:04.300" style="s2">is I want to get right I want to get a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:09.510" style="s2">process by which each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.300" end="00:10:12.100" style="s2">rationalities is constraining and right</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.510" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">being constrained there&#39;s a patch but</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.100" end="00:10:16.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a moat there&#39;s a pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:18.580" style="s2">mutual self-organization between them so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.510" end="00:10:20.500" style="s2">that rationality as a whole is</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.580" end="00:10:21.910" style="s2">transcending but it&#39;s fence ending in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.500" end="00:10:25.090" style="s2">rational way so it&#39;s rationally</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.910" end="00:10:35.500" style="s2">self-transcending rationality now I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.090" end="00:10:37.870" style="s2">think that connects wisdom to some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.500" end="00:10:41.770" style="s2">the central ideas you find in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.870" end="00:10:43.840" style="s2">Western notions in Western philosophy so</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.770" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">that notion of wisdom being connected to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.840" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">rationality in philosophical practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:49.890" style="s2">that you see in sort of Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">Socrates I think the definition I gave</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.890" end="00:10:55.030" style="s2">and also within stoicism I think it</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">comports well with all of that however</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.030" end="00:10:59.140" style="s2">and I will do this in this series I will</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">engage in self-criticism I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.140" end="00:11:04.390" style="s2">that that view that Leo and I published</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:07.660" style="s2">in 2012 I think it&#39;s inadequate in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.390" end="00:11:12.580" style="s2">ways because I think what&#39;s being left</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.660" end="00:11:14.470" style="s2">out is precisely the process is central</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.580" end="00:11:15.670" style="s2">to wisdom the cultivation of wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.470" end="00:11:17.260" style="s2">going through radical transformative</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">experience we need we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.260" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">appropriate secular technology for that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:24.010" style="s2">I tried to explore some of that with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.790" end="00:11:26.590" style="s2">things like the view from above and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.010" end="00:11:27.660" style="s2">ideas about gnosis and that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.590" end="00:11:31.580" style="s2">somehow incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.660" end="00:11:35.940" style="s2">and and there into the account of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.580" end="00:11:38.280" style="s2">how we aspire how we choose to become a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.940" end="00:11:39.960" style="s2">person other than we currently are and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.280" end="00:11:43.860" style="s2">to have a values that we currently do</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.960" end="00:11:45.480" style="s2">not have a Zegna scholar it says how how</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.860" end="00:11:48.210" style="s2">do we bring which she calls proleptic</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.480" end="00:11:50.390" style="s2">rationality into our accounts of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.210" end="00:11:52.650" style="s2">because if the aspiration for</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.390" end="00:11:54.410" style="s2">rationality if the aspiration for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.650" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">is itself not something that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.410" end="00:11:58.740" style="s2">rationally justifiable then our notion</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.420" end="00:12:01.100" style="s2">of rationality and wisdom has to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.740" end="00:12:03.590" style="s2">radically transformed to reincorporate</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.100" end="00:12:09.660" style="s2">aspiration into it so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.590" end="00:12:12.180" style="s2">missing and then I see all of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.660" end="00:12:14.730" style="s2">psycho tech practices that I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.180" end="00:12:17.700" style="s2">about as enhancing relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.730" end="00:12:21.300" style="s2">but what&#39;s also needed for the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.700" end="00:12:23.370" style="s2">wisdom is to incorporate a more explicit</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.300" end="00:12:25.800" style="s2">model of the nature of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.370" end="00:12:27.480" style="s2">because the difference the difference we</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.800" end="00:12:28.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand sort of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.480" end="00:12:30.360" style="s2">psychological and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:31.590" style="s2">consensus on this the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.360" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">knowledge and understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.590" end="00:12:34.980" style="s2">understanding is the ability to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:37.890" style="s2">the significance or the relevance of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.980" end="00:12:39.810" style="s2">your knowledge and so that&#39;s why wise</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.890" end="00:12:42.030" style="s2">people are not only insightful they have</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.810" end="00:12:46.470" style="s2">a deep kind of ability to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.030" end="00:12:48.860" style="s2">comprehend and so how the rational</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:52.020" style="s2">enhancement of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.860" end="00:12:54.990" style="s2">enhances understanding also needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.020" end="00:12:56.310" style="s2">much more explicitly developed so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.990" end="00:12:58.370" style="s2">not trying to be coy here but I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.310" end="00:13:00.840" style="s2">to show you that this is very much a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.370" end="00:13:05.880" style="s2">definition and development as you try</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.840" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">and bring in I think well maybe fill in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.880" end="00:13:10.890" style="s2">gaps and also try and link up with what</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:15.870" style="s2">I think is the emerging consensus view</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.890" end="00:13:18.150" style="s2">of wisdom so I mean that that carries</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.870" end="00:13:20.310" style="s2">with it two burdens one is and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.150" end="00:13:21.780" style="s2">very I hope consistent I hope maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.310" end="00:13:23.610" style="s2">sometimes a little too aggressive about</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.780" end="00:13:25.260" style="s2">this but I&#39;m very critical of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.610" end="00:13:28.970" style="s2">current conceptions of rationality as</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.260" end="00:13:30.780" style="s2">being too thin very too thin and too</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.970" end="00:13:34.830" style="s2">propositional belief inferential</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.780" end="00:13:36.839" style="s2">argumentative and not capturing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.830" end="00:13:39.330" style="s2">richness of rationality its connections</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.839" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">to insight its connections to aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.330" end="00:13:43.829" style="s2">its connections</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:46.920" style="s2">to transformation its connections to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.829" end="00:13:49.290" style="s2">deep understanding and so if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.920" end="00:13:52.260" style="s2">integrate rationality and wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.290" end="00:13:54.230" style="s2">think we should together but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">have to really enrich our notions of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.230" end="00:13:58.260" style="s2">rationality to encompass these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:00.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve been mentioning so that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.260" end="00:14:03.690" style="s2">a more comprehensive account of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.529" end="00:14:04.649" style="s2">right right and so I can like probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.690" end="00:14:08.010" style="s2">take you down like a thousand different</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.649" end="00:14:11.459" style="s2">threats based off uh you just said but</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.010" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">I&#39;ll open it up to the the group anyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.459" end="00:14:15.089" style="s2">has any questions for John just maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">just raise your hand I can see everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.089" end="00:14:30.690" style="s2">I think I&#39;ll call on you or just go on</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:34.050" style="s2">mute and just ask away Jordan hey John</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.690" end="00:14:35.699" style="s2">so something I&#39;ve been noticing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.050" end="00:14:37.410" style="s2">been mentioning in a lot of these groups</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.699" end="00:14:40.410" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been having but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.410" end="00:14:43.139" style="s2">noticing it has been emerging in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.410" end="00:14:44.370" style="s2">of conversations around the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.139" end="00:14:46.440" style="s2">things that we&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.370" end="00:14:49.470" style="s2">now something I&#39;ve noticed as this</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.440" end="00:14:53.399" style="s2">caught is this conversation about trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.470" end="00:14:56.610" style="s2">to be very non egoic about things and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.399" end="00:14:58.470" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good thing to do and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.610" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">seems to me to be the case that we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.470" end="00:15:03.240" style="s2">like too much narcissism in our society</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:05.100" style="s2">and in particular I find narcissism to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.240" end="00:15:10.500" style="s2">be like a kind of spiritual threat that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.100" end="00:15:15.019" style="s2">I have to deal with and and yet I feel</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.500" end="00:15:18.269" style="s2">like the extreme non egoism is too</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.019" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">reactionary and I noticed sometimes when</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.269" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">people try to enact like pure non-ego</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:25.589" style="s2">ISM it&#39;s it comes off very uh it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:29.910" style="s2">seems very like non-human and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.589" end="00:15:31.529" style="s2">off-putting to me so my issue that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.910" end="00:15:34.170" style="s2">kind of like to ask you about is if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.529" end="00:15:36.089" style="s2">have any comments or anything to add on</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.170" end="00:15:38.490" style="s2">your own is that I think that people is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.089" end="00:15:41.550" style="s2">a tendency to engage non-ego eclis in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.490" end="00:15:44.310" style="s2">way that like overly down regulates your</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.550" end="00:15:49.949" style="s2">own impulses to differ from the group</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.310" end="00:15:51.930" style="s2">consensus and still and so on and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.949" end="00:15:54.329" style="s2">there&#39;s god I feel like there&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.930" end="00:15:54.780" style="s2">be some good way to integrate like like</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.329" end="00:15:58.080" style="s2">a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.780" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">ego into into the way that we engage</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.080" end="00:16:04.740" style="s2">with each other in like a partially non</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:05.880" style="s2">egoic collective fashion and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:08.010" style="s2">wondering if you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.880" end="00:16:09.570" style="s2">that or comments yeah yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.010" end="00:16:11.130" style="s2">Thank You Jordan I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.570" end="00:16:12.750" style="s2">excellent question I think it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.130" end="00:16:15.810" style="s2">pertain to the issue of wisdom because</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.750" end="00:16:18.750" style="s2">as you say mini wisdom traditions are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.810" end="00:16:21.630" style="s2">purported to claim that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.750" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">they the summit of wisdom is to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:27.270" style="s2">a state of non egoic or non duality</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:28.890" style="s2">those shouldn&#39;t be identified together</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.270" end="00:16:31.200" style="s2">by the way they&#39;re often identified</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.890" end="00:16:32.610" style="s2">together I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.200" end="00:16:33.750" style="s2">problematic thing to do maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.610" end="00:16:36.750" style="s2">talk about that later but let&#39;s go to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.750" end="00:16:40.980" style="s2">your the main question which is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.750" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">notion of you know I I think you see you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.980" end="00:16:45.570" style="s2">seem to be agreeing because narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">is an extreme form of this that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.570" end="00:16:49.770" style="s2">are ways in which ego centrism</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:52.290" style="s2">an unchallenged ego centrism can by us</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.770" end="00:16:55.710" style="s2">or cognition and bias or behavior it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.290" end="00:16:58.350" style="s2">very self deceptive ways there the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.710" end="00:17:00.680" style="s2">question that they think that emerges is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.350" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">that there seems to then be an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.680" end="00:17:06.540" style="s2">move and implicit identity that the sole</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:08.550" style="s2">function of the ego is to bias or right</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.540" end="00:17:11.180" style="s2">and that that is always negative and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.550" end="00:17:15.510" style="s2">then the issue I have with that is well</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.180" end="00:17:18.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not I think it&#39;s fair the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.510" end="00:17:22.110" style="s2">word I&#39;ve maybe done because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.420" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">think a cognition without framing or</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.110" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">filtering makes any sense and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.040" end="00:17:30.570" style="s2">saying that what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">gonna get to a state that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.570" end="00:17:36.990" style="s2">free of perspective and has no framing</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:39.420" style="s2">and I and I have brought this up with</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.990" end="00:17:41.190" style="s2">people explicitly so this is not just</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.420" end="00:17:43.140" style="s2">you know this is not just off the cuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.190" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten in our discussions or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.140" end="00:17:47.700" style="s2">arguments in the philosophical sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">the word about this it&#39;s like um tell me</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.700" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">how what you&#39;re proposing is any</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:54.900" style="s2">different from combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">and just being overwhelmed by you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.900" end="00:17:58.800" style="s2">the indefinitely large amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:01.470" style="s2">information available in all directions</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.800" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">in all permeable combination bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.470" end="00:18:08.460" style="s2">bla the stuff I argue for right so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:11.550" style="s2">what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.460" end="00:18:14.010" style="s2">my nan egoism is that you have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.550" end="00:18:15.660" style="s2">and this is something that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.010" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">working with Elizabeth long about if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:20.250" style="s2">mean by that functions of framing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:22.830" style="s2">filtering and relevance realization are</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.250" end="00:18:24.780" style="s2">somehow silenced that sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.830" end="00:18:26.280" style="s2">cognitive suicide because that sounds to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.780" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">me like you&#39;re undermining all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.280" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">processes that have to run I can&#39;t see I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:33.930" style="s2">need I need a concrete proposal about</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">how you get something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.930" end="00:18:38.670" style="s2">categorization going how you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:40.920" style="s2">communication going how you get basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.670" end="00:18:42.360" style="s2">you know solving of goal or solving the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.920" end="00:18:44.010" style="s2">problems that how you get all of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.360" end="00:18:45.930" style="s2">going without anything like relevance</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.010" end="00:18:48.030" style="s2">realization so if that&#39;s what people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.930" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">talking about they&#39;re tough and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.030" end="00:18:50.670" style="s2">sometimes when I&#39;ve talked to people</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.490" style="s2">explicitly that&#39;s what they&#39;re claiming</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.670" end="00:18:56.430" style="s2">and then I try to I try to I ask them to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.490" end="00:18:59.100" style="s2">demonstrate right now in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.430" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">there be hit a behavior that indicates</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.100" end="00:19:02.490" style="s2">that and they&#39;ll do what you say they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:04.800" style="s2">start a talk and there and then I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.490" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">all you&#39;re doing is doing a particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.800" end="00:19:09.300" style="s2">kind of relevance realization you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:10.770" style="s2">just orienting to this and this is being</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.300" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">made salient and this is being</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.770" end="00:19:13.830" style="s2">foregrounded and this is being back</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">rounded you&#39;re not turning off this</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.830" end="00:19:17.190" style="s2">machinery you&#39;re just restructuring it</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:18.630" style="s2">in a certain way and you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.190" end="00:19:20.760" style="s2">already acknowledged that we can become</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.630" end="00:19:22.860" style="s2">less egocentric and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.760" end="00:19:25.470" style="s2">structuring things but if we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.860" end="00:19:29.310" style="s2">that if we mean about going non egoic</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.470" end="00:19:31.170" style="s2">that removing all framing all relevance</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.310" end="00:19:34.440" style="s2">realization that that makes no sense to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.170" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">me now it&#39;s what some people say sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.440" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">this is a long answer but this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:40.290" style="s2">profound question right some people say</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.780" style="s2">no no I don&#39;t mean that I acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.290" end="00:19:45.450" style="s2">that there has to be sort of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.780" end="00:19:47.400" style="s2">you know relevance realization or</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.450" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">salience landscaping or prospective</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.400" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">tribal knowing or participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.950" style="s2">I get all that but what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.940" end="00:19:54.630" style="s2">right so they&#39;ll say I don&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.950" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">lose yourself although some people claim</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.630" end="00:19:59.700" style="s2">that too there&#39;s a no self experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:01.860" style="s2">right or they can live as a no self</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.700" end="00:20:03.810" style="s2">perhaps as a better way of representing</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.860" end="00:20:06.570" style="s2">their to you they&#39;ll say no what what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.810" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">rep what I mean by that is you know like</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.570" end="00:20:10.650" style="s2">what happens in flow so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:12.180" style="s2">little bit more interesting because what</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.650" end="00:20:14.010" style="s2">happens in flow of course is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.180" end="00:20:16.590" style="s2">lose your agency you don&#39;t lose your</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.010" end="00:20:19.730" style="s2">relevance realization ability but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.590" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2">tend to lose that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.730" end="00:20:25.470" style="s2">autobiographical ego</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:27.000" style="s2">and since that&#39;s the one that we&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.470" end="00:20:30.330" style="s2">familiar with and the one we most</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.000" end="00:20:34.530" style="s2">valorize in the West for lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.330" end="00:20:36.950" style="s2">better designator I can understand what</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.530" end="00:20:40.200" style="s2">people mean by that and I tend to view</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.950" end="00:20:43.140" style="s2">claims like you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:45.860" style="s2">that Buddhism was arguing is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.140" end="00:20:47.730" style="s2">possible to let go of the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.860" end="00:20:49.710" style="s2">autobiographical ego and actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.730" end="00:20:51.510" style="s2">enhance agency we&#39;re enhancing agency</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.710" end="00:20:53.850" style="s2">means enhancing that capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.510" end="00:20:56.520" style="s2">connectedness relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.850" end="00:20:58.260" style="s2">insight problem-solving and so that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.520" end="00:20:59.640" style="s2">we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re actually getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.260" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually trying to show is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.640" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">the identity of our ego agency with our</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:06.900" style="s2">ego narrative is not a true identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:09.540" style="s2">even though our autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.900" end="00:21:16.590" style="s2">narrative claims that on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.540" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">so I see that that it is like that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.590" end="00:21:18.510" style="s2">can get</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve experienced that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.510" end="00:21:22.290" style="s2">experience the pure consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:25.130" style="s2">fact you can experience profound flow in</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.290" end="00:21:29.669" style="s2">which that that right that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.130" end="00:21:31.410" style="s2">autobiographical narrative ego goes away</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.669" end="00:21:33.660" style="s2">but even in the pure consciousness event</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.410" end="00:21:35.340" style="s2">even if right you all you are is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.660" end="00:21:36.750" style="s2">conscious you&#39;re just conscious and not</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.340" end="00:21:38.610" style="s2">even conscious of consciousness like</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.750" end="00:21:39.960" style="s2">form and says there&#39;s still the hereness</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.610" end="00:21:42.630" style="s2">there&#39;s still the now in this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.960" end="00:21:44.929" style="s2">still the six the salience in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.630" end="00:21:46.950" style="s2">a presence thing that doesn&#39;t disappear</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.929" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think you can shut off</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.950" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">right the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:55.890" style="s2">machinery and keep consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:22:00.600" style="s2">cognition running so like so how I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.890" end="00:22:02.580" style="s2">answer that is if we mean by ego right</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.600" end="00:22:04.380" style="s2">something that perhaps we shouldn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.580" end="00:22:07.220" style="s2">by the word self but that&#39;s problematic</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.380" end="00:22:11.700" style="s2">too if we mean you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.220" end="00:22:13.080" style="s2">machinery that drowns the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.700" end="00:22:16.049" style="s2">our our intelligence and our</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.080" end="00:22:18.870" style="s2">consciousness then I think talking as if</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.049" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">we can be non egoic it makes it makes no</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.870" end="00:22:26.220" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:28.860" style="s2">if we mean right a particular role by</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.220" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">which we try to identify with our ego</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.860" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2">agency a particular autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:35.620" style="s2">narrative role then I think that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:37.390" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.620" end="00:22:41.410" style="s2">away and that can pass away in a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.390" end="00:22:46.059" style="s2">that actually enhances our our agency so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.410" end="00:22:51.250" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of my answer what do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.059" end="00:22:53.260" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.250" end="00:22:57.100" style="s2">stuff in there but I&#39;m still confused</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.260" end="00:23:02.770" style="s2">because what I&#39;m really finding is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.100" end="00:23:07.960" style="s2">working for me is when I see ways in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.770" end="00:23:13.530" style="s2">which people try to like overly D</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.960" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">identify with their ego and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.530" end="00:23:20.550" style="s2">it seems to have some kinds of bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:23.170" style="s2">effects or or in myself I see it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.550" end="00:23:26.290" style="s2">the risk is that you fail to really</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.170" end="00:23:28.330" style="s2">bring yourself to bear in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.290" end="00:23:31.170" style="s2">it is that you have or like ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.330" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">offering in a group dynamic that makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.170" end="00:23:36.370" style="s2">add something you know good yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:37.929" style="s2">extreme version of this is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.370" end="00:23:40.900" style="s2">very interested in like trickster</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.929" end="00:23:42.670" style="s2">archetype sorts of figures and something</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.900" end="00:23:45.550" style="s2">occurred to me recently when I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.670" end="00:23:47.640" style="s2">looking at several of them and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.550" end="00:23:50.020" style="s2">that they do serve a really important</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.640" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">function that Johnathan Pidgeotto talks</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.020" end="00:23:53.380" style="s2">about a lot which is kind of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:56.220" style="s2">person who comes out and really like</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.380" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">rings the alarm bells and is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.220" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">point out the absurdity of like large</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:01.809" style="s2">structures that most people are afraid</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.120" style="s2">of and something I&#39;ve noticed about</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.809" end="00:24:08.170" style="s2">these characters is that almost all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.120" end="00:24:11.860" style="s2">them have an extreme narcissistic streak</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.170" end="00:24:14.830" style="s2">also and so it I see how like most of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.860" end="00:24:16.660" style="s2">these characters it&#39;s almost like being</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.830" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">a trickster part of that is having like</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.660" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">an extremely gaudy ego almost an heart</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:26.860" style="s2">and parcel with the role and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:30.790" style="s2">really I&#39;m really stuck with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:33.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the the like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.790" end="00:24:34.929" style="s2">egoic perspective the classically</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.160" end="00:24:36.940" style="s2">whatever ego perspective that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.929" end="00:24:40.870" style="s2">attacked that might be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.940" end="00:24:44.620" style="s2">beneficial well okay so look there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.870" end="00:24:46.530" style="s2">things here I mean what was the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.620" end="00:24:48.670" style="s2">point about bringing yourself to bear</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.530" end="00:24:49.450" style="s2">well let&#39;s do know that your first point</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.670" end="00:24:50.679" style="s2">was the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.450" end="00:24:53.019" style="s2">things are people where people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.679" end="00:24:54.820" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to act non-ego eclis I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.019" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">guess I would need to know specifically</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.820" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">what that is if that means you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">adopting a particular man or a speech</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:05.080" style="s2">and things like that I I&#39;m I just I want</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:08.440" style="s2">to know how that possibly could bring</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.080" end="00:25:12.039" style="s2">about you know for me to get it to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.440" end="00:25:14.110" style="s2">the ways you get outside of that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.039" end="00:25:18.090" style="s2">narrative ego is like to get into a deep</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.110" end="00:25:20.980" style="s2">flow state and again that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.090" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">something in which you be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.980" end="00:25:25.330" style="s2">yourself to bear on situations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:27.669" style="s2">actually massively improved rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.330" end="00:25:29.250" style="s2">being diminished now - and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.669" end="00:25:34.269" style="s2">not irrelevant to your second point</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.250" end="00:25:38.260" style="s2">because the trickster figure right I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.269" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it has to be wedded to at</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.260" end="00:25:42.820" style="s2">least narcissism or maybe even as what</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:44.460" style="s2">you&#39;re calling a a strong narrative ego</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:48.820" style="s2">for example or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.460" end="00:25:51.100" style="s2">because the Taoist sages are pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.820" end="00:25:53.470" style="s2">at you know representing a trickster</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:55.630" style="s2">figure swans uh and loud say especially</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.470" end="00:25:58.539" style="s2">Swan Hill right he just come he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.630" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">the epitome of a trickster figure but he</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.539" end="00:26:04.570" style="s2">does that in a way that doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:07.299" style="s2">be our self-promotional in any fashion</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.570" end="00:26:08.710" style="s2">and that&#39;s because as I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.299" end="00:26:10.269" style="s2">argue I think that wisdom is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.710" end="00:26:12.700" style="s2">religion of flow he&#39;s bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.269" end="00:26:16.330" style="s2">capacity for just tremendous flow to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.700" end="00:26:18.820" style="s2">bear on the projects of attacking the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.330" end="00:26:21.669" style="s2">Confucian system attacking the computer</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.820" end="00:26:23.470" style="s2">Imperial state and yet it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.669" end="00:26:26.649" style="s2">he&#39;s doing that without having to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.470" end="00:26:30.700" style="s2">wedded to being self-promotional in any</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.649" end="00:26:33.639" style="s2">fashion so I don&#39;t know if the trickster</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.700" end="00:26:35.139" style="s2">archetype needs to be narcissistic or</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.639" end="00:26:38.110" style="s2">self-promotional because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.139" end="00:26:39.610" style="s2">give you a clear historical case and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.110" end="00:26:41.500" style="s2">know and that&#39;s also brings us back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.610" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">our topic because these people were</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.500" end="00:26:46.750" style="s2">considered sort of quintessential</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:49.149" style="s2">representatives of wisdom within you</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.750" end="00:26:52.210" style="s2">know Chinese culture and I think you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.149" end="00:26:55.059" style="s2">find similar version I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.210" end="00:26:57.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which Socrates is very</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.059" end="00:27:01.389" style="s2">much a trickster figure in a law in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.730" end="00:27:03.340" style="s2">lot of ways and yet one thing and he is</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.389" end="00:27:05.920" style="s2">clearly capable of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.340" end="00:27:07.240" style="s2">self-referential in the framing sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.920" end="00:27:09.400" style="s2">that we were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.240" end="00:27:12.220" style="s2">bringing his agency to bear on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.400" end="00:27:16.200" style="s2">situation but he&#39;s not self-promotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.220" end="00:27:19.630" style="s2">in in that sense that doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.200" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">what&#39;s motivating him at least a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.630" end="00:27:25.300" style="s2">platonic version we had so I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:28.270" style="s2">denying your claim I hope you realize</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.300" end="00:27:30.010" style="s2">that that it is the case in many you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.270" end="00:27:33.340" style="s2">know mythologies the trickster will come</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.010" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">across a and you get you get extreme</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.340" end="00:27:37.300" style="s2">versions of this of course in the Joker</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:41.020" style="s2">where that narcissism becomes you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.300" end="00:27:43.500" style="s2">just destructive and and overweening so</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.020" end="00:27:46.450" style="s2">yes the trickster figure can be that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.500" end="00:27:48.220" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying to answer I think a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.450" end="00:27:51.040" style="s2">deeper question that I sensed in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.220" end="00:27:54.550" style="s2">question which is it is this necessary</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.170" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">thanks a lot I think that brings up</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:05.890" style="s2">really helps to integrate a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:08.530" style="s2">kind of things that I felt like could</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.890" end="00:28:10.030" style="s2">potentially get lost if you try or at</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.530" end="00:28:13.560" style="s2">least in the way that I like sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.030" end="00:28:16.330" style="s2">tried to be more Nani going so thank you</p>

<p begin="00:28:18.430" end="00:28:22.870" style="s2">why I alluded to him at the last I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.990" end="00:28:34.690" style="s2">that the self-knowledge issue is crucial</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.090" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">here to that to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:39.580" style="s2">Socratic project and and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:41.500" style="s2">mean to know thyself in a way that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:43.750" style="s2">you know narcissistic not saw</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.750" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">brings you into dialectic you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.080" end="00:28:51.370" style="s2">brings your agency to bear it causes a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:53.530" style="s2">flourishing of your agency and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.370" end="00:28:54.760" style="s2">agencies of others etc so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.530" end="00:28:58.440" style="s2">think your question is very pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.760" end="00:28:59.770" style="s2">it&#39;s very much in my mind I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.440" end="00:29:01.990" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.770" end="00:29:06.070" style="s2">Jake Jake you had your hand up first and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.990" end="00:29:08.740" style="s2">then Brent yeah I just wanted to if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.070" end="00:29:10.540" style="s2">okay just just pull on that ego thread a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.740" end="00:29:12.760" style="s2">little bit more because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.540" end="00:29:14.740" style="s2">biggest resonances in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.760" end="00:29:16.360" style="s2">series that I hope and expect you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.740" end="00:29:17.140" style="s2">in to maybe a little bit with with David</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.360" end="00:29:19.780" style="s2">Chapman</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.140" end="00:29:22.230" style="s2">is is to Robert Keegan and his kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.780" end="00:29:25.570" style="s2">conception of psychological development</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.230" end="00:29:27.460" style="s2">and I mean he takes the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.570" end="00:29:28.780" style="s2">psychoanalytic view of ego which it</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.460" end="00:29:29.920" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s a similar one to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.780" end="00:29:32.380" style="s2">one that you&#39;re taking us just this kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.920" end="00:29:34.090" style="s2">of wholesale or this whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.380" end="00:29:36.160" style="s2">apparatus by which we make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.090" end="00:29:38.410" style="s2">world which includes our sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.160" end="00:29:40.030" style="s2">but also our kind of models of how</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.410" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">things are and of ethics and how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.030" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">relate to others and the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:49.000" style="s2">wisdom that emerges from from Keegan is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">something like at least the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.000" end="00:29:54.190" style="s2">reading it as as a kind of permeability</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:57.820" style="s2">of the ego where it&#39;s not that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.190" end="00:30:01.570" style="s2">having an ego is bad or or even possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.820" end="00:30:04.570" style="s2">or even avoidable but rather that it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.570" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">to be perpetually vulnerable to updating</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.570" end="00:30:11.080" style="s2">and even wholesale kind of revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:13.810" style="s2">updating and so I guess I just have you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.080" end="00:30:16.030" style="s2">riff on that oh well thank you because</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.810" end="00:30:19.540" style="s2">that I think that lines up with what I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.030" end="00:30:22.630" style="s2">was arguing a minute ago with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.540" end="00:30:24.310" style="s2">because if if what&#39;s at the core of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.630" end="00:30:25.900" style="s2">functionality as I&#39;ve been arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.310" end="00:30:28.750" style="s2">something like relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.900" end="00:30:31.300" style="s2">if relevance realization is something</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.750" end="00:30:33.700" style="s2">that&#39;s an ongoing evolution right of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.300" end="00:30:35.290" style="s2">your your fitness your cognitive fitness</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.700" end="00:30:36.970" style="s2">to the environment and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.290" end="00:30:39.040" style="s2">it&#39;s being powered perhaps by things</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.970" end="00:30:40.630" style="s2">like self-organizing criticality and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.040" end="00:30:42.730" style="s2">can go through radical restructuring and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.630" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">insight that comports exactly with what</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.730" end="00:30:47.350" style="s2">you just said right there that so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:48.970" style="s2">machinery is going what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.350" end="00:30:50.290" style="s2">do and this is what I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.970" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">I said I think wisdom is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.290" end="00:30:55.870" style="s2">about trying to overcome the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.180" style="s2">which our adaptive processes are</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.870" end="00:31:00.100" style="s2">actually making us maladaptive which</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.180" end="00:31:02.830" style="s2">maybe is ultimately what was at the core</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.100" end="00:31:04.780" style="s2">of the psychoanalytic tradition but</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.830" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">anyways trying to inhibit that wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.780" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">ultimately about trying to enhance with</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:11.890" style="s2">the best tools available right trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:14.200" style="s2">enhance our relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.890" end="00:31:16.210" style="s2">machinery which would mean in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.200" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">to make it I wouldn&#39;t use the word</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.210" end="00:31:21.460" style="s2">permeable but I but I don&#39;t know deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.930" end="00:31:23.170" style="s2">opposed to it the word I tend to use is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.460" end="00:31:25.180" style="s2">you know what we&#39;re doing is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.170" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">it side activity we&#39;re increasing its</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.180" end="00:31:31.970" style="s2">ability to you know to move soon</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:34.460" style="s2">Ruth Lee not in a sense of continuously</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.970" end="00:31:36.500" style="s2">in a linear fashion but that the system</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.460" end="00:31:38.510" style="s2">can move between assimilation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.500" end="00:31:41.240" style="s2">accommodation without fracturing without</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.510" end="00:31:43.580" style="s2">losing its integrity as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.240" end="00:31:46.730" style="s2">system so yeah that&#39;s I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.580" end="00:31:48.200" style="s2">like a very very very heartily but so so</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.730" end="00:31:51.740" style="s2">go ahead go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.200" end="00:31:55.010" style="s2">are you gonna say yeah if again it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.740" end="00:31:56.360" style="s2">depends again how we I mean we&#39;ve gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.010" end="00:31:57.740" style="s2">have to stipulate how we&#39;re gonna you</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.360" end="00:31:59.630" style="s2">know what what the reference is for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.740" end="00:32:03.169" style="s2">turn amigo and if we take it to mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.630" end="00:32:05.299" style="s2">right because there&#39;s a sense in which I</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.169" end="00:32:06.470" style="s2">and I want it I just want to make this</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.299" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">point because it might sound like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.470" end="00:32:12.440" style="s2">contradicting myself so I&#39;m sorry for</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.210" end="00:32:14.360" style="s2">just keeping going but so I often talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.440" end="00:32:16.429" style="s2">about relevance realization being Priya</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.360" end="00:32:19.940" style="s2">going because in that sense what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.429" end="00:32:22.580" style="s2">is the autobiographical you know self</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.940" end="00:32:24.770" style="s2">reflective narrative that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.580" end="00:32:26.809" style="s2">relevance realization it is presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.770" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">by all of that processing so in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.809" end="00:32:31.309" style="s2">sense I think relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:32.929" style="s2">Priya going but if we mean by ego which</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.309" end="00:32:35.030" style="s2">I might say is like what we mean by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.929" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">self or something like that is that sum</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.030" end="00:32:42.980" style="s2">total of machinery that makes us capable</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">of coupling to reality complexify our</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.980" end="00:32:48.140" style="s2">cognition in right in a coupled manner</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:50.659" style="s2">to the complexity of reality then yes I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.140" end="00:32:53.780" style="s2">agree with Keegan completely I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.659" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">know his work that well and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.780" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">coming into it and so I don&#39;t want to I</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.330" style="s2">want to be very cautious here about not</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:06.260" style="s2">pretending to have an expertise about</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.330" end="00:33:08.440" style="s2">him that I don&#39;t have it the only other</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.260" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">thing I was gonna ask about is is I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.440" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">guess one reason why people might think</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:17.390" style="s2">naively that what you want to do is get</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">to a not neglect state is if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.390" end="00:33:22.010" style="s2">how those stages progress they do</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:25.010" style="s2">progress in what seems to be a direct at</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.010" end="00:33:28.309" style="s2">least the the ego gets more capacious</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.010" end="00:33:29.900" style="s2">and more inclusive of things that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.309" end="00:33:31.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t include but I mean you speak</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.900" end="00:33:36.470" style="s2">about integration and differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.159" end="00:33:39.610" style="s2">which he also speaks about if one goes</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.470" end="00:33:41.750" style="s2">up they don&#39;t realize it has to go up in</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.610" end="00:33:43.880" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.750" end="00:33:47.630" style="s2">that that&#39;s excellent that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.880" end="00:33:48.830" style="s2">excellent what you just said is what if</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.630" end="00:33:50.390" style="s2">I understand you correctly and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.830" end="00:33:52.400" style="s2">interjected I&#39;m getting you wrong please</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.390" end="00:33:55.130" style="s2">but what I what I hear you saying is</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.400" end="00:33:57.020" style="s2">people are on there they&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.130" end="00:33:58.490" style="s2">attention to that the true development</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.020" end="00:34:01.010" style="s2">that&#39;s giving the emergent function is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.490" end="00:34:03.650" style="s2">one of complexification they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.010" end="00:34:06.020" style="s2">seeing it simplistically as you know an</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.650" end="00:34:10.340" style="s2">expansion in some sense is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.020" end="00:34:12.230" style="s2">correct yeah yeah the way he puts it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.340" end="00:34:14.780" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re progressing toward</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.230" end="00:34:17.360" style="s2">guaranteeing the world and others and</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.780" end="00:34:20.380" style="s2">yourself more and more and more of their</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.360" end="00:34:23.540" style="s2">kind of unique identity which entails</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.380" end="00:34:25.100" style="s2">expanding your your your sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.540" end="00:34:27.410" style="s2">kind of the boundaries between things</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.100" end="00:34:29.780" style="s2">and and and right</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.410" end="00:34:31.370" style="s2">not pretty maturely making inferences</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.780" end="00:34:34.190" style="s2">about the how they are but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.370" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">entail a total lack of differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.190" end="00:34:40.700" style="s2">and okay yeah the oneness yeah it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:42.650" style="s2">be coherent yeah because if you lost the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.700" end="00:34:45.170" style="s2">differentiation ability you&#39;d lose the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.650" end="00:34:46.880" style="s2">ability to pick up on novelty you&#39;d look</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.170" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">up you lose the ability to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.880" end="00:34:51.050" style="s2">these alternative perspectives the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:52.850" style="s2">uniqueness of people etc etc all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.050" end="00:34:58.610" style="s2">would be lost you become insensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.850" end="00:34:59.890" style="s2">it Thanks thank you that was excellent I</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.610" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">enjoyed that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.890" end="00:35:11.240" style="s2">Brent did you still have a question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:14.270" style="s2">sharing a link in the chat it&#39;s the d DK</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.240" end="00:35:16.730" style="s2">I whi deep actually sorry the link says</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.270" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">it wrong but it&#39;s di KY data</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.730" end="00:35:23.000" style="s2">knowledge information wisdom hmm I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:25.880" style="s2">I think this is a useful starting point</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.000" end="00:35:29.570" style="s2">there&#39;s different variations on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.880" end="00:35:31.850" style="s2">diagram but just thought I&#39;d offer it up</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.570" end="00:35:34.010" style="s2">as a conversation piece I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.850" end="00:35:35.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s a kind of map that puts</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.010" end="00:35:39.130" style="s2">wisdom in the context of these other</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.510" end="00:35:42.530" style="s2">concepts and also kind of convergent</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.130" end="00:35:45.980" style="s2">directionality I think it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.530" end="00:35:48.440" style="s2">useful primer for a lesson or for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.980" end="00:35:50.690" style="s2">group discussion because you have that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.440" end="00:35:52.040" style="s2">kind of map and I just just wonder your</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.690" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">thoughts on it where it fits into your</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.040" end="00:35:58.029" style="s2">models well I thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:36:00.970" style="s2">take an in-depth look at it so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.029" end="00:36:02.019" style="s2">I&#39;m familiar with things similar where</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.970" end="00:36:03.849" style="s2">people you know where you have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.019" end="00:36:05.109" style="s2">technical sense of information and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.849" end="00:36:06.819" style="s2">you have the semantic extensive</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.109" end="00:36:09.150" style="s2">information and then you have knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.819" end="00:36:11.289" style="s2">and then you have something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.150" end="00:36:13.240" style="s2">understanding where wisdom beyond it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.289" end="00:36:16.450" style="s2">it is this is it something like that as</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.240" end="00:36:17.890" style="s2">as a progression yeah there if you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.450" end="00:36:19.960" style="s2">click the link there&#39;s a simple image</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.890" end="00:36:22.180" style="s2">and if you do a google image search too</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.960" end="00:36:27.420" style="s2">there&#39;s different types of this diagram</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.180" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2">it means some have a lower tier of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.420" end="00:36:33.460" style="s2">measurement before data and some have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:36.309" style="s2">higher tier of vision after wisdom the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.460" end="00:36:38.500" style="s2">one that I shared it has the context and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.309" end="00:36:41.710" style="s2">understanding on the edges so I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.500" end="00:36:46.029" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.710" end="00:36:48.190" style="s2">coherent ones yeah yeah I see it I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.029" end="00:36:50.349" style="s2">it&#39;s a useful orientation for her for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.190" end="00:36:54.309" style="s2">anybody kind of entering this topic</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.349" end="00:36:56.650" style="s2">rather than just us try to define define</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.309" end="00:37:02.859" style="s2">the word wisdom where it&#39;s you know its</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.650" end="00:37:04.690" style="s2">history yeah so I mean I I I did I thank</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.859" end="00:37:08.619" style="s2">you for saying that I I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.690" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">allude to that in that I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.619" end="00:37:13.269" style="s2">show a continuum from information in in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.380" end="00:37:15.579" style="s2">the technical sense which I take to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.269" end="00:37:17.140" style="s2">like data and then information in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.579" end="00:37:21.819" style="s2">semantic sense which is like information</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.140" end="00:37:24.549" style="s2">and then to knowledge and then so so in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.819" end="00:37:26.019" style="s2">data information in the Shannon and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.549" end="00:37:28.089" style="s2">Weaver&#39;s sense is just a probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.019" end="00:37:30.339" style="s2">relationship between events so that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.089" end="00:37:32.920" style="s2">can use one event to predict another in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.339" end="00:37:35.650" style="s2">that sense there&#39;s a Titanic amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.920" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">information information and then people</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.650" end="00:37:38.829" style="s2">talk and there&#39;s lots of work being done</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:41.410" style="s2">now I know how does that how does that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.829" end="00:37:43.690" style="s2">meaningless sense of information become</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.410" end="00:37:46.299" style="s2">what we normally mean by information so</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.690" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">I&#39;ll use your terms how does data become</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.299" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">information in the sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">something that is meaningful to us and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:54.279" style="s2">that&#39;s where I think the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:56.009" style="s2">realization machinery is doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.279" end="00:37:58.630" style="s2">important work I think when relevance</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.009" end="00:38:01.059" style="s2">realization picks up on the correlations</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.630" end="00:38:02.440" style="s2">that are adaptively predictive and makes</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.059" end="00:38:03.460" style="s2">them salient to an individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.440" end="00:38:06.430" style="s2">when you&#39;re starting to get information</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.460" end="00:38:08.680" style="s2">in the semantic sense and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.430" end="00:38:10.809" style="s2">as it says in there as it gets organized</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.680" end="00:38:15.339" style="s2">when you get that and then when you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.809" end="00:38:17.109" style="s2">higher order systems coordinating those</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.339" end="00:38:19.089" style="s2">semantic pieces of information you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.109" end="00:38:20.619" style="s2">knowledge oh and again that takes more</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.089" end="00:38:22.029" style="s2">relevant to see what you&#39;re getting is</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.619" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">you&#39;re getting recursive relevance</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.029" end="00:38:26.920" style="s2">realization and then to trying as I said</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:29.470" style="s2">to try and figure out the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.920" end="00:38:31.390" style="s2">significance of the knowledge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.470" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">ultimately and not just in a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.390" end="00:38:36.539" style="s2">sense but in in this how its significant</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:39.579" style="s2">existentially how its significant</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.539" end="00:38:42.930" style="s2">practically I think that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.579" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">knowledge starts to move into wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.930" end="00:38:47.589" style="s2">III didn&#39;t see I didn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t aware</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:49.510" style="s2">of that pyramid before but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.589" end="00:38:51.039" style="s2">have something that I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.510" end="00:38:53.049" style="s2">convergent with it because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.039" end="00:38:54.609" style="s2">arguing for that kind of continuum and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.049" end="00:38:57.510" style="s2">what you see is you&#39;ve seen sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.609" end="00:39:00.670" style="s2">recursive relevance realization being</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:03.940" style="s2">invoked which is kind of an Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.670" end="00:39:06.220" style="s2">model that the process of information is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.940" end="00:39:10.200" style="s2">constantly being recursively applied to</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.220" end="00:39:13.960" style="s2">give us higher higher emergent functions</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.200" end="00:39:19.539" style="s2">so that that&#39;s how I would try and link</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.960" end="00:39:23.740" style="s2">up with what you sent all right</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.539" end="00:39:27.400" style="s2">Paul had his hand up for a while so then</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.740" end="00:39:31.720" style="s2">Mike I think I have a question I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.400" end="00:39:34.900" style="s2">to articulate what I&#39;m thinking John you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.720" end="00:39:36.549" style="s2">talked about values I think you talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.900" end="00:39:38.740" style="s2">about like values if you were moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.549" end="00:39:42.819" style="s2">upwards to higher values let&#39;s say or</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.740" end="00:39:44.980" style="s2">greater values could you be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.819" end="00:39:47.260" style="s2">more specific let&#39;s say I have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.980" end="00:39:49.299" style="s2">set of values right now and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.260" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">values oh you talked about aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.299" end="00:39:54.039" style="s2">values yeah I aspiring to values and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:57.010" style="s2">virtues that I currently don&#39;t have yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.039" end="00:39:58.930" style="s2">yes so always pair that I try to always</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.010" end="00:40:00.910" style="s2">pair the two together if I forgot to I</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.930" end="00:40:03.099" style="s2">that was a mistake on my part right no</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.910" end="00:40:06.039" style="s2">no so yeah I think you said aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.099" end="00:40:09.400" style="s2">two values right so I&#39;m assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.039" end="00:40:11.470" style="s2">inherent in that process in order to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.400" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">aspire to greater values you also have</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.470" end="00:40:17.859" style="s2">to at some point come to the realization</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:19.840" style="s2">that your current values have some some</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.859" end="00:40:21.430" style="s2">form of deception</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.840" end="00:40:23.590" style="s2">what depends what you mean by you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.430" end="00:40:25.810" style="s2">to I mean some I wouldn&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:28.030" style="s2">it a causal precursor because people</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.810" end="00:40:29.770" style="s2">often aspire before they&#39;ve come to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.030" end="00:40:31.810" style="s2">judgement that their current values are</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.770" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">wrong they only come to seeing those</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.810" end="00:40:36.490" style="s2">values in coming into question as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.170" style="s2">aspiration process is ongoing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.490" end="00:40:39.190" style="s2">phrase for this for example happens</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.170" end="00:40:42.130" style="s2">pretty regularly when I&#39;m teaching</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.190" end="00:40:43.960" style="s2">people meditation they&#39;ll go in for all</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.130" end="00:40:45.610" style="s2">these things and they want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.960" end="00:40:46.780" style="s2">maybe be more peaceful or something they</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.610" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">don&#39;t quite know what that means but as</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.780" end="00:40:51.550" style="s2">they start to aspire towards it then</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:54.220" style="s2">they will start to say oh the current</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.550" end="00:40:55.630" style="s2">value is that I&#39;m living by and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.220" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">necessarily ones that are undermining</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.630" end="00:41:00.700" style="s2">their desires for peace they may say oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:03.220" style="s2">geez you know it&#39;s this value that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.700" end="00:41:04.870" style="s2">thought I had it like yeah I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.220" end="00:41:06.700" style="s2">coming to call it in question because of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.870" end="00:41:08.050" style="s2">the meditation so I don&#39;t know what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.700" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">would say it&#39;s a causal precursor I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.050" end="00:41:11.950" style="s2">would say that at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:13.180" style="s2">aspiration process you will come you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.950" end="00:41:15.580" style="s2">will at least reflectively</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.180" end="00:41:17.560" style="s2">come back and question values that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.580" end="00:41:18.940" style="s2">previously have but very often you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">see their limitation until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.940" end="00:41:23.740" style="s2">transcended them is what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:27.100" style="s2">right so I guess my question within that</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.740" end="00:41:29.530" style="s2">is let&#39;s say if we&#39;re always if the goal</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.100" end="00:41:32.140" style="s2">is to always move upwards for lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.530" end="00:41:37.900" style="s2">better way to putting in towards a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.140" end="00:41:41.290" style="s2">greater a greater higher values or like</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.900" end="00:41:44.080" style="s2">a greater expansion of values aren&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.290" end="00:41:46.600" style="s2">always at some point resting at some</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.080" end="00:41:49.720" style="s2">level of self-deception and can we ever</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.600" end="00:41:51.010" style="s2">not be deceiving ourselves if we have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.720" end="00:41:54.040" style="s2">orient towards the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.010" end="00:41:58.540" style="s2">I guess I&#39;m Mike my ultimate question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.040" end="00:42:00.190" style="s2">is what is that self-deception bound to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.540" end="00:42:03.900" style="s2">if we have to orient ourselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.190" end="00:42:08.050" style="s2">world and and sit with any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.900" end="00:42:09.460" style="s2">understanding does that make me well ii</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.050" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">would not I&#39;m not quite clear on so let</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.460" end="00:42:13.210" style="s2">me answer the first one and then let you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:16.150" style="s2">come back to me because maybe if I enter</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.210" end="00:42:18.130" style="s2">the first one that&#39;ll help you clarify</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.150" end="00:42:22.330" style="s2">what you meant by the second one so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.130" end="00:42:26.910" style="s2">I think I think there&#39;s a enemy I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.330" end="00:42:30.610" style="s2">I would agree very strongly with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.910" end="00:42:33.430" style="s2">thesis that we can never be in a place</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.610" end="00:42:35.950" style="s2">in which we have certainty</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.430" end="00:42:38.470" style="s2">and and that and and and and what that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.950" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">means is there is no place in which we</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.470" end="00:42:43.960" style="s2">are absolutely secure and so in this way</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:46.059" style="s2">I&#39;m not sort of I think a classical</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.960" end="00:42:49.690" style="s2">Buddhist right there is a place in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.059" end="00:42:52.660" style="s2">we can be as we can be assured that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.690" end="00:42:55.059" style="s2">are free forever from self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.660" end="00:42:56.559" style="s2">precisely because I don&#39;t think as I</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.059" end="00:42:58.359" style="s2">tried to argue you we&#39;re always having</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.559" end="00:43:01.569" style="s2">to use heuristics and when they get</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.359" end="00:43:05.530" style="s2">misapplied there&#39;s a bias and and things</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.569" end="00:43:08.109" style="s2">like that and so can we get better for</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.530" end="00:43:10.869" style="s2">sure but can you give me an algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.109" end="00:43:13.660" style="s2">that will guarantee that this particular</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.869" end="00:43:16.119" style="s2">solution I have to overcoming bias is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.660" end="00:43:17.619" style="s2">going to apply to all possible future</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.119" end="00:43:19.930" style="s2">contexts that are comput orally</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.619" end="00:43:21.730" style="s2">explosive no way I just don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.930" end="00:43:24.069" style="s2">I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s true I just</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.730" end="00:43:26.109" style="s2">don&#39;t believe for I think I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.069" end="00:43:28.150" style="s2">riffing on arguments that I hope you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.109" end="00:43:31.089" style="s2">seen that there&#39;s arguments around that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.150" end="00:43:33.339" style="s2">that&#39;s just not something we can pursue</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.089" end="00:43:36.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.339" end="00:43:38.530" style="s2">deeply critical of Descartes because he</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.520" end="00:43:40.990" style="s2">seemed to think he had a method that if</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.530" end="00:43:42.609" style="s2">followed correctly would with you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.990" end="00:43:44.619" style="s2">completely inoculate us for all time</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.609" end="00:43:46.059" style="s2">against self-deception in other places</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.619" end="00:43:46.990" style="s2">he seems to undermine that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.059" end="00:43:50.920" style="s2">at least places where he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.990" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">explicitly claim that so this this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.920" end="00:43:56.130" style="s2">why I try to I mean and this term is no</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:43:58.750" style="s2">slipping I use always use the term</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.130" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">optimization in contrast to maximization</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.750" end="00:44:02.470" style="s2">we can sort of optimization means you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:04.270" style="s2">can continually improve but now</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.470" end="00:44:06.910" style="s2">optimization because it&#39;s been rendered</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.270" end="00:44:08.530" style="s2">a theoretical formal term is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.910" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">sound like what maximization used to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.530" end="00:44:13.270" style="s2">sound like I don&#39;t think we can become</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:18.190" style="s2">maximally free from self-deception but</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.270" end="00:44:20.200" style="s2">we can become optimally freer from it so</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.190" end="00:44:22.630" style="s2">that&#39;s how I would I would answer the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.200" end="00:44:25.150" style="s2">fertile now the thing is that&#39;s he that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.630" end="00:44:27.609" style="s2">still gives me I think all the moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.150" end="00:44:30.099" style="s2">motivation I need right it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.609" end="00:44:32.920" style="s2">you should still go is you know keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.099" end="00:44:34.150" style="s2">going as far as you can and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.920" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">interesting because in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.150" end="00:44:38.680" style="s2">mystical traditions even within the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.299" style="s2">Christian mystical traditions they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.680" end="00:44:41.980" style="s2">a notion I&#39;ll talk about this later in</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.299" end="00:44:44.410" style="s2">this series called epic thesis</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.980" end="00:44:47.230" style="s2">well you don&#39;t come to rest even right</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.410" end="00:44:49.660" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is right in in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.230" end="00:44:50.530" style="s2">after life the blessed life epic thesis</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.660" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">means you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.530" end="00:44:55.600" style="s2">self-transcending because you can never</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:58.210" style="s2">achieve the perfection of God you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.600" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">never come to God that to that god-like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.210" end="00:45:03.130" style="s2">state so that&#39;s how answer the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:04.570" style="s2">question yeah I was thinking about I</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.130" end="00:45:06.820" style="s2">guess that&#39;s the way I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.570" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">about it was developmentally like it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.820" end="00:45:10.570" style="s2">I imagine that even if you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:13.750" style="s2">something to practice and you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.570" end="00:45:15.100" style="s2">more insight and more realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.750" end="00:45:16.980" style="s2">you&#39;re still happy you know stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.100" end="00:45:20.140" style="s2">orient to the world and the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.980" end="00:45:22.600" style="s2">constantly evolving so like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.140" end="00:45:24.910" style="s2">relationship but I think you answer that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.600" end="00:45:27.190" style="s2">is that I mean I think there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.910" end="00:45:29.740" style="s2">going to be new new problems and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.190" end="00:45:35.740" style="s2">whatever we can do in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.740" end="00:45:39.070" style="s2">developing ourselves in order to I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.740" end="00:45:41.050" style="s2">that&#39;s right and I mean if you use the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.070" end="00:45:42.880" style="s2">evolutionary knowledge I do every</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.050" end="00:45:44.740" style="s2">species eventually goes extinct right</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:47.980" style="s2">there isn&#39;t there isn&#39;t a final solution</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.740" end="00:45:49.420" style="s2">to this but it doesn&#39;t mean that some</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.980" end="00:45:51.850" style="s2">species can&#39;t survive much longer</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.420" end="00:45:54.190" style="s2">through many more challenges and changes</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.850" end="00:45:56.740" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s not like everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.190" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">washes out into a margin as equality or</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.740" end="00:46:05.140" style="s2">something like that either</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.190" end="00:46:08.650" style="s2">yeah developmentally yeah I guess what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.140" end="00:46:10.510" style="s2">see development and I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.650" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">acknowledge this if this is something</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.510" end="00:46:15.190" style="s2">that can be challenged but the way I see</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:18.010" style="s2">development I see it in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.190" end="00:46:19.630" style="s2">normativity of agency so development is</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.010" end="00:46:22.980" style="s2">the enhancement of agency not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.630" end="00:46:29.950" style="s2">individual also shared collective agency</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.980" end="00:46:32.680" style="s2">and so if we are reliably not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.950" end="00:46:38.070" style="s2">not finally completely but if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.680" end="00:46:42.609" style="s2">reliably optimizing the capacity for our</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.070" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">agency to adapt right to evolve itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.609" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">to the changing world that&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:50.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s the normative goal we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:53.690" style="s2">should be shooting towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.680" end="00:46:56.030" style="s2">which I which I like I say I think you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.690" end="00:46:57.530" style="s2">get pretty clear measures of that within</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.030" end="00:46:59.330" style="s2">all of the traditions even within the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.530" end="00:47:01.100" style="s2">Christian tradition which usually which</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.330" end="00:47:03.020" style="s2">is usually represented as you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.100" end="00:47:05.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a final culmination resting</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.020" end="00:47:07.190" style="s2">point but within Eastern Orthodox the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.480" end="00:47:09.380" style="s2">Eastern Orthodox tradition though</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.190" end="00:47:11.030" style="s2">there&#39;s this other notion of epic thesis</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.380" end="00:47:15.560" style="s2">there&#39;s no no you&#39;re never finished you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.030" end="00:47:18.580" style="s2">can&#39;t be it&#39;s not possible I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.560" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">answered your questions yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.580" end="00:47:25.450" style="s2">also I saw Mike you raised your hand and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:28.690" style="s2">Narayan has his hand so maybe I can go</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.450" end="00:47:28.690" style="s2">hey John</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.900" end="00:47:35.720" style="s2">my question so I&#39;ve been a magician for</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.060" end="00:47:37.610" style="s2">you know since I was 13 years old and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.720" end="00:47:40.130" style="s2">frequently had this experience in</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.610" end="00:47:42.260" style="s2">performing where we&#39;re you know the sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.130" end="00:47:44.870" style="s2">of punch line hits and the person like</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.260" end="00:47:47.300" style="s2">has this recognition that what they</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.870" end="00:47:49.640" style="s2">thought they there&#39;s more to what they</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.300" end="00:47:51.470" style="s2">had been through anything so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.640" end="00:47:53.000" style="s2">this like sliver of reality they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.470" end="00:47:55.340" style="s2">perceiving and something happens that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.000" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">indicates to them but there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.340" end="00:47:58.030" style="s2">something more going on than that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:00.920" style="s2">were killed</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.030" end="00:48:03.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed I&#39;ve had experiences in my</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.920" end="00:48:06.170" style="s2">life where I feel something similarly</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.740" end="00:48:08.330" style="s2">standing on the other side like like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.170" end="00:48:12.110" style="s2">life is performing a magic trick to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.330" end="00:48:14.780" style="s2">and I had this experience where like</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.110" end="00:48:17.090" style="s2">almost like a door opens you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.780" end="00:48:18.920" style="s2">room that you know previously thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.090" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">was completely enclosed and a little</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.920" end="00:48:23.210" style="s2">light shines feels like precursor to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:25.850" style="s2">some degree of insight because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.210" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">know what&#39;s outside of the door I might</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.850" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">not even know where the door is but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">know that there&#39;s something broader and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:35.000" style="s2">it is openness so I associate that with</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:37.730" style="s2">the word wonder it&#39;s like wandering in</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.000" end="00:48:40.310" style="s2">of both world is something broad and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.730" end="00:48:42.200" style="s2">feels like something that creates like</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.310" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">the fertile soil for wisdom to then</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.200" end="00:48:47.360" style="s2">emerge I&#39;m wondering that with that what</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:49.940" style="s2">in the work that you&#39;ve done how you</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.360" end="00:48:55.430" style="s2">conceive of the relationship the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.940" end="00:48:58.370" style="s2">between wisdom and wonder so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.430" end="00:49:00.650" style="s2">definitely I mean there&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.370" end="00:49:03.569" style="s2">episode 33 where I talk about wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.650" end="00:49:06.309" style="s2">then that will come back again into</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.569" end="00:49:09.009" style="s2">the discussion of wisdom it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.309" end="00:49:12.309" style="s2">big part of this the series of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.009" end="00:49:14.589" style="s2">because Socrates famously argued that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.309" end="00:49:15.519" style="s2">wisdom begins in wonder and then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.589" end="00:49:17.769" style="s2">have the two different interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.519" end="00:49:20.049" style="s2">you have the Aristotelian interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.769" end="00:49:22.230" style="s2">that well what what what Socrates meant</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.049" end="00:49:25.749" style="s2">was curiosity and then you try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.230" end="00:49:27.309" style="s2">resolve it right with knowledge and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.749" end="00:49:29.200" style="s2">see that exemplified in the Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.309" end="00:49:31.180" style="s2">project where Plato says no no what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.200" end="00:49:32.859" style="s2">do with Wonder is you try and deepen it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.180" end="00:49:35.049" style="s2">and enhance it until you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.859" end="00:49:37.749" style="s2">state of awe because ah does what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.049" end="00:49:39.880" style="s2">just said it it affords you a I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.749" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">you said like a fertile field in which</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.880" end="00:49:45.549" style="s2">the the structure of the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:47.410" style="s2">structure of yourself can come in can</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.549" end="00:49:50.170" style="s2">come deeply into question and you are</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.410" end="00:49:52.210" style="s2">motivated to allow them to 20 go</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.170" end="00:49:55.390" style="s2">transformation and I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.210" end="00:49:57.279" style="s2">clear so I would distinguish curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.390" end="00:49:59.109" style="s2">from wonder along those lines and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.279" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">think you&#39;re right you should know by</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.109" end="00:50:02.650" style="s2">the way that there&#39;s cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:05.410" style="s2">scientists are starting to use magic</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.650" end="00:50:06.910" style="s2">tricks as a way of testing insight and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.410" end="00:50:08.859" style="s2">insight problem-solving there like</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.910" end="00:50:12.849" style="s2">experimental work being done on that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.859" end="00:50:15.819" style="s2">so there&#39;s work I&#39;m doing with Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.849" end="00:50:17.019" style="s2">Craig and NAPLAN paper Mian and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.819" end="00:50:19.749" style="s2">trying to argue that there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.019" end="00:50:22.630" style="s2">continuum from like insight through to</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.749" end="00:50:24.039" style="s2">flow right to something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.630" end="00:50:25.690" style="s2">enlightenment and then there&#39;s work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.039" end="00:50:28.420" style="s2">doing with John Logan basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.690" end="00:50:31.269" style="s2">and and along there there&#39;s a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.420" end="00:50:33.480" style="s2">from sort of you know finding things</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.269" end="00:50:37.329" style="s2">salient to finding them interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.480" end="00:50:41.739" style="s2">interested in them right into you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.329" end="00:50:44.019" style="s2">getting a sense of wonder and then where</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.739" end="00:50:46.470" style="s2">that sense of being in things is now</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.019" end="00:50:49.989" style="s2">being opened up as you said to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.470" end="00:50:51.759" style="s2">transformation to awe in which people</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.989" end="00:50:54.009" style="s2">are not just sort of being motivated</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.759" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">they feel like there&#39;s a demand on them</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.009" end="00:50:59.499" style="s2">to undergo transformation to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:00.789" style="s2">awakening experiences in which people</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.499" end="00:51:02.680" style="s2">who&#39;ve experienced what I&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.789" end="00:51:04.450" style="s2">elsewhere and I talked about in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.680" end="00:51:07.720" style="s2">series as canto normativity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.450" end="00:51:10.210" style="s2">really real that absolutely not in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.720" end="00:51:12.819" style="s2">metaphysical absolute but they see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.210" end="00:51:16.210" style="s2">unthinkable for them to ignore this</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.819" end="00:51:16.900" style="s2">demand to get as close to transform</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.210" end="00:51:20.740" style="s2">their lie</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.900" end="00:51:25.089" style="s2">and their world themselves so that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.740" end="00:51:27.670" style="s2">can get as for then it&#39;s close to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.089" end="00:51:29.710" style="s2">really real as you possibly can now I</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.670" end="00:51:32.589" style="s2">think all of that is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.710" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">fundamental machinery that&#39;s needed if</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.589" end="00:51:37.059" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to engage in that project</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:38.289" style="s2">the aspirational project of self</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.059" end="00:51:40.269" style="s2">transcendence and self transformation</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.289" end="00:51:42.190" style="s2">that is at the heart of wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.269" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">that so I ultimately as you see I have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.190" end="00:51:47.289" style="s2">platonic interpretation of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:49.329" style="s2">claim rather than Aristotelian and not</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.289" end="00:51:51.039" style="s2">because I don&#39;t believe in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.329" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">satisfy curiosity and pursue knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.039" end="00:51:56.349" style="s2">I&#39;m a scientist but I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:51:58.779" style="s2">that the path to wisdom and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.349" end="00:52:01.740" style="s2">current is that where wonder is being</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.779" end="00:52:03.999" style="s2">met in that sense of right open you up</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.740" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">to put it in sort of a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.999" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">framework that you might be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:09.460" style="s2">with the series I think curiosity is in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:11.799" style="s2">the having mode and I think wonder is in</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.460" end="00:52:13.569" style="s2">the being mode and that&#39;s what Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.799" end="00:52:15.640" style="s2">was ultimately talking about was not</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.569" end="00:52:17.980" style="s2">about having propositions but about</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.640" end="00:52:20.289" style="s2">undergoing a powerful course of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.980" end="00:52:24.519" style="s2">development so that&#39;s how I would answer</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.289" end="00:52:28.890" style="s2">that question morph oh thank you thank</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.519" end="00:52:31.210" style="s2">you that was a great question no right</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.890" end="00:52:34.089" style="s2">so I&#39;m kind of going off of what Mike</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.210" end="00:52:35.980" style="s2">was just saying about my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.089" end="00:52:40.630" style="s2">journey in sort of discovering these</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.980" end="00:52:42.579" style="s2">things that I consider to be wisdom I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.630" end="00:52:43.930" style="s2">aware that like I think using the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.579" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">framework that you described it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.930" end="00:52:49.539" style="s2">of like there&#39;s layers of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:51.730" style="s2">within myself and as I&#39;m able to clear</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.539" end="00:52:54.279" style="s2">up certain self-deceptions more of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.730" end="00:52:56.829" style="s2">world becomes available to me and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.279" end="00:52:58.239" style="s2">able to recognize it for what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.829" end="00:52:59.950" style="s2">also the reverse as more of the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.239" end="00:53:01.809" style="s2">becomes available to you</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.950" end="00:53:03.220" style="s2">that helps shine a light if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.809" end="00:53:05.349" style="s2">me to speak metaphorically into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.220" end="00:53:07.539" style="s2">layers of your psyche and disclose other</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.349" end="00:53:09.849" style="s2">layers of self-deception very much yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.539" end="00:53:12.789" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s like this nice upward</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.849" end="00:53:13.779" style="s2">spiral thing going on one of the cool</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.789" end="00:53:15.759" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve noticed as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.779" end="00:53:20.200" style="s2">interacting with various communities</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.759" end="00:53:22.509" style="s2">around Toronto and online is that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.200" end="00:53:23.950" style="s2">have no idea about the types of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.509" end="00:53:26.349" style="s2">that are going to sort of like I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.950" end="00:53:28.289" style="s2">to stumble into other than I can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.349" end="00:53:29.950" style="s2">spot different wisdom traditions in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.289" end="00:53:33.640" style="s2">different communities</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.950" end="00:53:35.710" style="s2">and so I feel like there&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.640" end="00:53:37.780" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.710" end="00:53:39.730" style="s2">flavors of self-deception that are sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.780" end="00:53:41.710" style="s2">of going on with me in that different</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.730" end="00:53:43.900" style="s2">communities have come up different ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.710" end="00:53:45.790" style="s2">of like unraveling those so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.900" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">curious about if you can take a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.790" end="00:53:50.890" style="s2">bit about your own personal journey and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:52.450" style="s2">if you&#39;ve been able to recognize very</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.890" end="00:53:54.609" style="s2">distinctive flavors like I know you did</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.450" end="00:53:57.299" style="s2">some circling stuff and so it to me that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.609" end="00:54:01.329" style="s2">felt like one of those examples Oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.299" end="00:54:02.440" style="s2">totally so and I have I have Peter to</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.329" end="00:54:07.990" style="s2">thank for that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.440" end="00:54:09.430" style="s2">and and also coming into contact and for</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.990" end="00:54:12.790" style="s2">Peter also putting me into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.430" end="00:54:14.740" style="s2">guy guys hence talk yeah I love what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.790" end="00:54:16.510" style="s2">said I thought was beautiful flavors and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.740" end="00:54:20.650" style="s2">because there&#39;s an element of getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.510" end="00:54:23.710" style="s2">the taste for things that&#39;s that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.650" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">of wisdom it used to be and so we sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.710" end="00:54:27.369" style="s2">of trivialize the notion of taste down</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:29.079" style="s2">to just sort of you know hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.369" end="00:54:30.609" style="s2">aesthetic aesthetic choice or something</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.079" end="00:54:31.990" style="s2">like that but taste meant something</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.609" end="00:54:34.750" style="s2">that&#39;s why we used to talk about good</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.990" end="00:54:36.819" style="s2">taste and it meant something right so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.750" end="00:54:39.190" style="s2">like I like that I like that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.819" end="00:54:43.329" style="s2">metaphors really sang to me I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.190" end="00:54:46.869" style="s2">you&#39;re right I think that this is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.329" end="00:54:48.430" style="s2">and this is not an idea I mean turning</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.869" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">it into a theoretical idea I guess is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.430" end="00:54:50.950" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:53.770" style="s2">for a long time but it&#39;s not an idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.950" end="00:54:55.690" style="s2">that originated with me which is why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.770" end="00:54:58.809" style="s2">really and I was trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.690" end="00:55:00.400" style="s2">that again with this model of wisdom as</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.809" end="00:55:02.020" style="s2">rashly self-transcending rationalities</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.400" end="00:55:03.609" style="s2">where there are different flavors of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.020" end="00:55:05.319" style="s2">rationality for different flavors of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.609" end="00:55:06.490" style="s2">knowing and they have to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.319" end="00:55:08.349" style="s2">coordinated together in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.490" end="00:55:11.200" style="s2">self-correcting self-organizing system</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.349" end="00:55:13.450" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what goes back because</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.200" end="00:55:15.609" style="s2">like I was taught in ecology practices I</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.450" end="00:55:19.750" style="s2">was taught you know a contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.609" end="00:55:24.099" style="s2">practice a right into the contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.750" end="00:55:27.369" style="s2">practice drawn probably from arianna</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.099" end="00:55:29.589" style="s2">Buddhism Metta I was meditating practice</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.369" end="00:55:31.420" style="s2">probably from care of Aden right</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.589" end="00:55:34.500" style="s2">Vipassana then I was starting moving</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.420" end="00:55:39.220" style="s2">practice from Taoism right Tai Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.500" end="00:55:41.460" style="s2">and and and very much what you said and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.220" end="00:55:44.520" style="s2">then all along the way I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.460" end="00:55:45.780" style="s2">learning the Neoplatonic tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.520" end="00:55:49.319" style="s2">then starting to pick up some of those</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.780" end="00:55:52.200" style="s2">practices you know and both</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.319" end="00:55:56.760" style="s2">interpersonal and an extra personal and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.200" end="00:56:02.550" style="s2">interpersonal so I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.760" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">and so I think you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.550" end="00:56:06.119" style="s2">problem here because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:09.450" style="s2">scalability issue that was we is really</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.119" end="00:56:13.319" style="s2">on my mind right now but I think we we</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.450" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">do have to try and get and I practiced</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.319" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">that myself trying to get a sense from</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:23.010" style="s2">the inside and that takes a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:25.980" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I&#39;m sort of hesitant</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.010" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">making this you really have to get aware</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.980" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">of multiple paths and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.319" end="00:56:31.530" style="s2">experience it participant observation</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">but I would make it more than</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.530" end="00:56:35.190" style="s2">participant observation I would make it</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:36.990" style="s2">participant transformation that if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.190" end="00:56:40.260" style="s2">go through path immersion you really</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.990" end="00:56:43.950" style="s2">have to immerse to get this and then as</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.260" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">you get sets of these you get disability</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.950" end="00:56:48.990" style="s2">this dialectic ability right this meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:52.260" style="s2">systemic ability you&#39;ve met a path</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.990" end="00:56:53.880" style="s2">ability to to move between them and get</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.260" end="00:56:56.819" style="s2">them to talk to each other and form each</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.880" end="00:56:59.609" style="s2">other not not to converge on some home</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.819" end="00:57:01.980" style="s2">reach homogeneous aldous huxley and core</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.609" end="00:57:03.690" style="s2">or something like that but very much</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.980" end="00:57:07.319" style="s2">like what happens in circling well you</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.690" end="00:57:09.690" style="s2">get this dynamic coherence right that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.319" end="00:57:12.059" style="s2">where all their pieces are being held</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.690" end="00:57:13.890" style="s2">together dynamically and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.059" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">I that has been that has been a modus</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.890" end="00:57:17.670" style="s2">operandi for me from my life now for a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:19.740" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.670" end="00:57:22.290" style="s2">precisely because when I started on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.740" end="00:57:25.859" style="s2">path of wisdom cultivation I already had</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.290" end="00:57:27.510" style="s2">multiple traditions that had taught me I</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.859" end="00:57:29.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t I&#39;ve been immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.510" end="00:57:31.349" style="s2">Christianity that I was immersed in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.790" end="00:57:34.230" style="s2">Platonic world then I got immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.349" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">Taoism I got immersed in two different</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.230" end="00:57:42.980" style="s2">branches of Buddhism and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:46.109" style="s2">forth and so and I and I don&#39;t see I</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.980" end="00:57:47.480" style="s2">don&#39;t see an alternative to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.109" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">talking about I don&#39;t see an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.480" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">other than that the didn&#39;t to try to</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:55.060" style="s2">meet that demand of you know participant</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:57.610" style="s2">immersion</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.060" end="00:58:01.810" style="s2">in multiple paths which we&#39;ll take up</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.610" end="00:58:04.900" style="s2">long periods of life and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.810" end="00:58:06.220" style="s2">analogy I use I don&#39;t know but it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.900" end="00:58:07.660" style="s2">helpful to use but that&#39;s what I had to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.220" end="00:58:09.810" style="s2">do to become a cognitive scientist I</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.660" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">think I&#39;d to really understand</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.810" end="00:58:13.630" style="s2">philosophy really understand psychology</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.460" style="s2">really understand linguistics really</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.630" end="00:58:17.320" style="s2">understand cultural anthropology like</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.460" end="00:58:19.660" style="s2">you know and it was in school for like</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.320" end="00:58:21.460" style="s2">17 years because you you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.660" end="00:58:23.170" style="s2">to get right and then you do the</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.460" end="00:58:25.360" style="s2">synoptic integration between them which</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.170" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean reducing them all to one</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.360" end="00:58:29.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t all reduce to neuroscience you</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:32.290" style="s2">get them all talking to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.590" end="00:58:34.300" style="s2">there&#39;s reciprocally reinstructive</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.290" end="00:58:36.520" style="s2">synoptic integration and that&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.300" end="00:58:39.880" style="s2">of thing that&#39;s the thing I think we</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.520" end="00:58:43.060" style="s2">have to do for wisdom and it&#39;s hard and</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.880" end="00:58:46.560" style="s2">it&#39;s long but that&#39;s what Spinoza said</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.060" end="00:58:46.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes it so excellent oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.370" end="00:58:53.980" style="s2">thank you you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.540" end="00:59:11.290" style="s2">just wanna check if anyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.980" end="00:59:13.390" style="s2">question that&#39;s alive Tim yeah cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.290" end="00:59:14.890" style="s2">I just saw before we began yeah I just</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.390" end="00:59:17.020" style="s2">saw it I&#39;m looking forward to it that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.890" end="00:59:19.900" style="s2">that date works perfectly so I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.020" end="00:59:21.820" style="s2">that in their email back to you great</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.900" end="00:59:24.910" style="s2">good to see you no friend yeah lovely to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.820" end="00:59:27.670" style="s2">see you too so yeah I think the question</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.910" end="00:59:32.170" style="s2">I have here does follow on and is alive</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.670" end="00:59:34.150" style="s2">and so it makes it makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.170" end="00:59:36.910" style="s2">that what we&#39;re looking for is not to</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.150" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">reduce all of these various ways of</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.910" end="00:59:42.070" style="s2">engaging and transforming ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:44.260" style="s2">one kind of reductionist thing however</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.070" end="00:59:46.600" style="s2">it does also seemed to me that there may</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.260" end="00:59:48.250" style="s2">be certain kinds of practices and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.600" end="00:59:49.870" style="s2">advanced or suggest perhaps a certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.250" end="00:59:54.580" style="s2">kind of dialogue as one of those</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.870" end="00:59:56.770" style="s2">practices which draws on different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.580" end="00:59:58.930" style="s2">of practices and kind of puts them all</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.770" end="01:00:01.150" style="s2">together in one kind of float so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.930" end="01:00:02.380" style="s2">referenced before this notion of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.150" end="01:00:04.150" style="s2">know breaking up the frame and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.380" end="01:00:05.590" style="s2">reimagining it again and using</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.150" end="01:00:08.260" style="s2">meditation and contemplation as</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.590" end="01:00:08.859" style="s2">instancing that strikes me the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.260" end="01:00:10.660" style="s2">picks up the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.859" end="01:00:12.940" style="s2">floo so I&#39;d be interested to hear what</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.660" end="01:00:14.259" style="s2">your thoughts are about erase the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.940" end="01:00:16.359" style="s2">relationship between dialog and a</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.259" end="01:00:18.069" style="s2">practice that can tie in lots of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.359" end="01:00:20.460" style="s2">practices so we can begin to do more</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.069" end="01:00:25.089" style="s2">things in one kind of a mode</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.460" end="01:00:27.630" style="s2">beautiful beautiful so if you notice I I</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.089" end="01:00:31.239" style="s2">tend to use these two terms a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.630" end="01:00:33.400" style="s2">differently like dialogue and dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.239" end="01:00:36.940" style="s2">where I take dialectic to be something</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.400" end="01:00:40.119" style="s2">like or sometimes use deal logos to try</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.940" end="01:00:42.910" style="s2">and indicate that because dialectic is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.119" end="01:00:47.529" style="s2">is the psycho technology that I think so</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.910" end="01:00:49.809" style="s2">it picks up on the interpersonal like</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.529" end="01:00:52.329" style="s2">you just said all right but right</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.809" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">dialectic was also it relieve all</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.329" end="01:00:56.769" style="s2">ontological so it&#39;s doing dialectic is</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.640" end="01:00:59.289" style="s2">also a practice in which you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.769" end="01:01:01.900" style="s2">the frame breaking in the frame making</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.289" end="01:01:04.660" style="s2">your so you&#39;re doing what so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.900" end="01:01:06.369" style="s2">you know the uuuu if let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.660" end="01:01:07.809" style="s2">Neoplatonism because that&#39;s what the</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.819" end="01:01:13.450" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.410" end="01:01:15.489" style="s2">breaking it up into all of these</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.450" end="01:01:16.809" style="s2">possible variations and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.489" end="01:01:18.279" style="s2">doing something like symptomatic</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.809" end="01:01:20.289" style="s2">practice in which you&#39;re trying to draw</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.279" end="01:01:22.749" style="s2">it all the way back up and then the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.289" end="01:01:25.900" style="s2">point is that this this disc or that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.749" end="01:01:29.819" style="s2">inter intra personal discourse and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.900" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">intra personal you know frame</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.819" end="01:01:33.609" style="s2">transitioning they&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:36.489" style="s2">tightly talking to each other and when</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.609" end="01:01:38.950" style="s2">you&#39;re reading a patinas for example you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.489" end="01:01:41.559" style="s2">he&#39;s clearly talking to these students</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.950" end="01:01:42.759" style="s2">in the horizontal but he&#39;s also if</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.559" end="01:01:44.859" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me these metaphors he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.759" end="01:01:46.569" style="s2">also moving the vertical and those are</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.859" end="01:01:48.400" style="s2">so and together and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.569" end="01:01:51.329" style="s2">thing I was talking to guy about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.400" end="01:01:53.410" style="s2">recently our our most resource</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.329" end="01:01:54.730" style="s2">discussion was about that then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.410" end="01:01:56.680" style="s2">third thing happening is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.730" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">constantly moving between theory and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.680" end="01:02:01.989" style="s2">theory you&#39;re constantly moving between</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.799" end="01:02:04.150" style="s2">argumentation and then a contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.989" end="01:02:05.980" style="s2">control of what&#39;s coming out of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.150" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">argumentation and then their control</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.980" end="01:02:10.420" style="s2">feeds back into the argument and then so</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:12.069" style="s2">there&#39;s that fee so there&#39;s all three of</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.420" end="01:02:14.049" style="s2">those dimensions working this is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.069" end="01:02:16.210" style="s2">I&#39;m arguing is going on in dialectic and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.049" end="01:02:18.249" style="s2">then there&#39;s the fourth there&#39;s a fourth</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.210" end="01:02:22.330" style="s2">dimension of how those three coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.249" end="01:02:26.380" style="s2">together and how this particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.330" end="01:02:28.270" style="s2">instance is in a meta conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.380" end="01:02:30.370" style="s2">other instances so for example when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.270" end="01:02:33.040" style="s2">talking to guy his conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.370" end="01:02:35.410" style="s2">Jordan Hall is coming in and framing</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.040" end="01:02:37.840" style="s2">things my conversation with Jordan is</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.410" end="01:02:40.150" style="s2">framing things you know that circling I</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.840" end="01:02:42.820" style="s2">just had you know and so there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.150" end="01:02:44.410" style="s2">those four dimensions are constantly I</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.820" end="01:02:47.800" style="s2">play and you can see them for example</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.410" end="01:02:49.390" style="s2">clearly I play and I&#39;m taking platini&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.800" end="01:02:52.510" style="s2">here as an exemplar because all of those</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.390" end="01:02:54.310" style="s2">things I just said are all at work and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.510" end="01:02:56.080" style="s2">what&#39;s important for them for to answer</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.310" end="01:02:57.850" style="s2">your question and I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.080" end="01:03:00.550" style="s2">flic Highness is the answer that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.850" end="01:03:03.010" style="s2">talking about trying to find templates</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.550" end="01:03:05.140" style="s2">so which by which we can craft the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.010" end="01:03:07.000" style="s2">grammar and the vocabulary we need today</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.140" end="01:03:08.650" style="s2">but what was important about Platina</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.000" end="01:03:10.870" style="s2">says he was able to use what I just</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.650" end="01:03:13.000" style="s2">described to do the grand synoptic</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.870" end="01:03:15.010" style="s2">integration of everything that had</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.000" end="01:03:17.020" style="s2">become before him right he was able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.010" end="01:03:20.410" style="s2">integrate the Platonic there is Italian</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.020" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">the stoic aspects you know of some of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.410" end="01:03:23.710" style="s2">the encounter with some of the Eastern</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:26.350" style="s2">thinking that he he probably believed</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.710" end="01:03:29.980" style="s2">rushed up against you know all of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.350" end="01:03:32.650" style="s2">so that&#39;s I think your question is</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.980" end="01:03:34.570" style="s2">beautiful and I please understand that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.650" end="01:03:37.030" style="s2">everything I said is like it&#39;s it&#39;s Pro</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.570" end="01:03:38.620" style="s2">Tem it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah you&#39;ve taken me</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.030" end="01:03:40.690" style="s2">right to the edge of my thinking on this</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.620" end="01:03:42.310" style="s2">and this is what I&#39;m working on right</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.690" end="01:03:45.330" style="s2">now and this is what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.310" end="01:03:47.950" style="s2">understand you know the and how</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.330" end="01:03:49.690" style="s2">dialectic could be this meta psycho</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.950" end="01:03:52.360" style="s2">technology that coordinates with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.690" end="01:03:54.520" style="s2">meta heuristic of wisdom cultivation to</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.360" end="01:03:57.160" style="s2">give us what Jordan Hall says we need</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.520" end="01:03:59.170" style="s2">which is the the meta psyche for</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.160" end="01:04:01.690" style="s2">coordinating the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.170" end="01:04:04.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.690" end="01:04:07.570" style="s2">trying to get a deep analysis of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.960" end="01:04:10.360" style="s2">Plutonian template such that it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.570" end="01:04:12.730" style="s2">readily transferable into the embodied</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.360" end="01:04:15.070" style="s2">in active practice so that we can get</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.730" end="01:04:17.170" style="s2">something analogous to the synoptic</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.070" end="01:04:18.970" style="s2">integration going just like you say so I</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.170" end="01:04:24.580" style="s2">think your question is bang-on and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.970" end="01:04:27.130" style="s2">central yeah that sounds beautiful I</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.580" end="01:04:31.360" style="s2">mean the only thing that comes up to me</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.130" end="01:04:35.350" style="s2">to add is that well you&#39;ve been studying</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.360" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">for so long right and being engaged for</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.350" end="01:04:38.839" style="s2">so long</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:41.479" style="s2">and that the manifestation of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.839" end="01:04:45.019" style="s2">you&#39;re an important part of that as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.479" end="01:04:48.199" style="s2">key piece and there&#39;s a sense of much</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.019" end="01:04:51.739" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is actually the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.199" end="01:04:54.529" style="s2">most ubiquitous of all things it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.739" end="01:04:57.019" style="s2">a some kind of way of understanding how</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.529" end="01:04:58.999" style="s2">human beings themselves enter into</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.019" end="01:05:00.439" style="s2">broadly speaking developmental</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.999" end="01:05:03.439" style="s2">relationships with each other and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.439" end="01:05:05.299" style="s2">world which is the kind of thing that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.439" end="01:05:07.539" style="s2">desperately we desperately need to</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.299" end="01:05:09.979" style="s2">cultivate more of in the world and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.539" end="01:05:13.459" style="s2">there&#39;s all this you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.979" end="01:05:16.309" style="s2">appreciate this um as you referencing</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.459" end="01:05:19.069" style="s2">Platanos doing being able to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.309" end="01:05:21.499" style="s2">such deep traditions and there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.069" end="01:05:22.999" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately brought together so</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.499" end="01:05:25.939" style="s2">that in some sense there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.999" end="01:05:28.369" style="s2">negation of what we&#39;re working with we</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.939" end="01:05:30.589" style="s2">can we can particular eyes the depths of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.369" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">what we can to our time but then the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.589" end="01:05:38.089" style="s2">hope I feel I have is that that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:39.529" style="s2">process I don&#39;t know if I can use the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.089" end="01:05:41.689" style="s2">word praxis I&#39;m not really too familiar</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.529" end="01:05:44.920" style="s2">with the word practice praxis but that</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.689" end="01:05:48.979" style="s2">kind of mode of engaging itself can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.920" end="01:05:52.549" style="s2">modeled and enabled thereby to permeate</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.979" end="01:05:56.089" style="s2">into interactions in otherwise ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.549" end="01:05:58.369" style="s2">social spaces exactly yes exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.089" end="01:06:01.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the Socratic ideal of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.369" end="01:06:02.390" style="s2">examined life and the unexamined life is</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.130" end="01:06:04.219" style="s2">not worth living he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.390" end="01:06:05.439" style="s2">meaning in life he&#39;s not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.219" end="01:06:07.969" style="s2">just doing sort of academic</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.439" end="01:06:09.920" style="s2">philosophical analysis of the concepts</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.969" end="01:06:12.920" style="s2">by which we talk about certain key</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.920" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about just what you said</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.689" end="01:06:20.599" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about facilitating an</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:23.059" style="s2">examined life in the where examination</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.599" end="01:06:24.709" style="s2">means exactly this this permeation that</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.059" end="01:06:28.989" style="s2">makes me that makes your life as</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.709" end="01:06:31.459" style="s2">meaningful as possible exactly - exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.989" end="01:06:32.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why I that&#39;s why I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.459" end="01:06:36.890" style="s2">why I&#39;m entitled in the next series</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.630" end="01:06:39.529" style="s2">after Socrates because like Socrates in</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.890" end="01:06:43.640" style="s2">in many ways like he&#39;s The Fountainhead</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.529" end="01:06:45.679" style="s2">of all of these right of all of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.640" end="01:06:47.809" style="s2">issues in the and and these questions</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.679" end="01:06:48.520" style="s2">and the normative challenge to try and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.809" end="01:06:50.380" style="s2">and me</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.520" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">them that&#39;s why it&#39;s so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.380" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s why I think what</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:56.590" style="s2">you just said is so so central to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:59.080" style="s2">everything because if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.590" end="01:07:02.500" style="s2">permeate if it doesn&#39;t permeate in you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.080" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">know how you&#39;re going through your day</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.500" end="01:07:06.940" style="s2">to day life then it&#39;s not what all of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.200" end="01:07:09.940" style="s2">these people were talking about it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.940" end="01:07:13.350" style="s2">you know yes Socrates wasn&#39;t dying for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.940" end="01:07:17.880" style="s2">theory he was dying for a way of life</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.350" end="01:07:17.880" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:23.890" style="s2">so I have a question for you John but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.760" end="01:07:26.110" style="s2">also just wanted to make a note that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.890" end="01:07:28.900" style="s2">mentioned after the hour mark we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.110" end="01:07:30.369" style="s2">that facilitated group discussions but</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.900" end="01:07:32.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a nice flow going on with this</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.369" end="01:07:32.680" style="s2">Q&amp;A so I don&#39;t know if we want to break</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.200" end="01:07:35.140" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.680" end="01:07:36.550" style="s2">so when John&#39;s asking my question just a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.140" end="01:07:39.340" style="s2">few three the chat box just either say</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.550" end="01:07:42.820" style="s2">QA or group discussions and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.340" end="01:07:45.160" style="s2">decide what we&#39;ll do after that so John</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.820" end="01:07:47.650" style="s2">the question I have for you is so you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.160" end="01:07:49.869" style="s2">and I are investigating these authentic</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.650" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">dialogue modality and I said and I thank</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.869" end="01:07:54.390" style="s2">you for that I thank you for that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:57.010" style="s2">think you you&#39;ve been you&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.390" end="01:07:58.510" style="s2">inspirational and insightful and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.010" end="01:07:59.350" style="s2">know good a good calling a good friend</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.510" end="01:08:02.320" style="s2">about all of us</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.350" end="01:08:05.980" style="s2">I appreciate that and just sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.320" end="01:08:07.240" style="s2">group John and I have been viewing kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.980" end="01:08:10.480" style="s2">of modalities or in experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.240" end="01:08:12.310" style="s2">modalities like we got an insight dialog</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.480" end="01:08:14.680" style="s2">coming up empathy circles and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.310" end="01:08:17.560" style="s2">regularly practicing in a private group</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.680" end="01:08:19.990" style="s2">circling and so the question I have for</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.560" end="01:08:21.940" style="s2">you is just what is your experience so</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.990" end="01:08:25.240" style="s2">far circling and maybe what is your</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.940" end="01:08:27.430" style="s2">insights and takeaways oh so circling as</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.240" end="01:08:29.200" style="s2">well I had an insight and you were there</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.430" end="01:08:31.630" style="s2">but I think you&#39;re asking me to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.200" end="01:08:34.270" style="s2">perhaps share it now and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.630" end="01:08:36.730" style="s2">explore this because it was so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.270" end="01:08:39.460" style="s2">two kinds of insights what are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.730" end="01:08:43.509" style="s2">insights in the circling and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.460" end="01:08:44.770" style="s2">and so they they belong in the circling</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.509" end="01:08:47.680" style="s2">right they&#39;re they&#39;re about how the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.770" end="01:08:49.839" style="s2">circling restructures itself and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.680" end="01:08:53.230" style="s2">gets that kind of flow and I&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.839" end="01:08:55.299" style="s2">back to do maybe a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.230" end="01:08:57.310" style="s2">phenomenal phenomenal adji and</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.299" end="01:08:59.650" style="s2">functionality but there was an insight a</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.310" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">more like calling of scientific ins that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.650" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">I had which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.820" end="01:09:09.300" style="s2">I noticed that there&#39;s expla and other</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.980" end="01:09:10.350" style="s2">people were reporting in the circle and</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.300" end="01:09:11.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve read it in some of the literature</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.350" end="01:09:13.770" style="s2">people often have an experience of kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.940" end="01:09:15.030" style="s2">of a super salience of other human</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.770" end="01:09:18.450" style="s2">beings they&#39;re very present and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.030" end="01:09:19.830" style="s2">almost shining and glowing right and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.450" end="01:09:22.380" style="s2">know almost like the halos in some</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.830" end="01:09:24.090" style="s2">mythologies right and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.380" end="01:09:26.760" style="s2">similar to reports of what people</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.090" end="01:09:30.660" style="s2">experience when they&#39;re on psilocybin</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.760" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">for example and so I&#39;m still playing</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.660" end="01:09:34.710" style="s2">with this idea but it did feel it</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">intuitively feels like there&#39;s fruit in</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.710" end="01:09:39.110" style="s2">there that&#39;s going to be born right that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:42.690" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in circling right is</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.110" end="01:09:46.230" style="s2">you&#39;re right you&#39;re connecting when I</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.690" end="01:09:48.060" style="s2">enter personally in novel and fluid and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.230" end="01:09:50.940" style="s2">constantly insightfully restructuring</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.060" end="01:09:53.360" style="s2">ways so there&#39;s all this new novel but</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.940" end="01:09:56.310" style="s2">nevertheless intelligible ways in which</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.360" end="01:09:59.520" style="s2">interpersonal distributed cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.310" end="01:10:01.830" style="s2">occurring and then and of course what</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:03.300" style="s2">happens is and we know this from all the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.830" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">synchrony studies when people are in</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.300" end="01:10:08.820" style="s2">joint attention right there you get</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:11.190" style="s2">brain synchronization going I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.820" end="01:10:14.510" style="s2">thinking well maybe what happens is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.190" end="01:10:17.220" style="s2">though that you know that novelty of</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.510" end="01:10:18.960" style="s2">connectivity is not it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.220" end="01:10:20.730" style="s2">internalized so that areas of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.960" end="01:10:21.810" style="s2">are talking to each other that normally</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.730" end="01:10:24.420" style="s2">don&#39;t talk to each other there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.810" end="01:10:26.670" style="s2">dynamic restructuring of the grammar of</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.420" end="01:10:27.630" style="s2">our cognition in that sense and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.670" end="01:10:29.730" style="s2">really interesting because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.630" end="01:10:31.790" style="s2">exactly what psilocybin does right it</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.730" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">gets areas of to the brain that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.790" end="01:10:36.180" style="s2">normally talk to each other it like to</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:38.730" style="s2">talk to each other it reshapes the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.180" end="01:10:42.570" style="s2">connectivity and and I find that really</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.730" end="01:10:45.000" style="s2">really interesting because that that to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.570" end="01:10:47.490" style="s2">me with it&#39;s this is not exhaustive by</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.000" end="01:10:49.710" style="s2">any means but that&#39;s that to me is an</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.490" end="01:10:51.330" style="s2">example of just the kind of thing I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.710" end="01:10:53.790" style="s2">talking to Tim about you&#39;re getting this</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.330" end="01:10:56.280" style="s2">interpersonal thing horizontal but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.790" end="01:10:58.560" style="s2">then leading to this kind of intra</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.280" end="01:11:01.680" style="s2">cerebral complexification that&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.560" end="01:11:03.900" style="s2">you access to new you know new levels of</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.680" end="01:11:06.570" style="s2">disclosure of reality and those things</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.900" end="01:11:09.180" style="s2">are talking to each other in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.570" end="01:11:11.880" style="s2">circling practice which I find I find</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.180" end="01:11:13.950" style="s2">really really promising</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.880" end="01:11:18.090" style="s2">and I want to load that word with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.950" end="01:11:20.100" style="s2">of sort of earth know other things that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.090" end="01:11:23.090" style="s2">I found so interesting is I you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.100" end="01:11:25.530" style="s2">the way in which certainly gets into you</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.090" end="01:11:27.060" style="s2">and I&#39;ve kept a guy about this you get</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.530" end="01:11:29.970" style="s2">into something like a collective flow</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.060" end="01:11:32.580" style="s2">state in which right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.970" end="01:11:36.450" style="s2">constant challenges right to to you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.580" end="01:11:38.640" style="s2">to to X to articulate and to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.450" end="01:11:40.530" style="s2">authentic and to be transparent and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.640" end="01:11:43.320" style="s2">be responsive like into balance your</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.530" end="01:11:46.950" style="s2">responsibility to your against your</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.320" end="01:11:49.350" style="s2">sovereignty and all these like to it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.950" end="01:11:52.620" style="s2">very demanding environment well I find</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.350" end="01:11:55.110" style="s2">it very commanding but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.620" end="01:11:56.970" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s skilfully facilitated like</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.110" end="01:11:59.580" style="s2">like you know what you you need for flow</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.970" end="01:12:01.350" style="s2">where the demands are just you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.580" end="01:12:01.890" style="s2">zone of proximal development just beyond</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.350" end="01:12:03.540" style="s2">your skills</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.890" end="01:12:05.490" style="s2">so everybody&#39;s skill stretching and</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.540" end="01:12:07.470" style="s2">they&#39;re getting sort of a Haws and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.490" end="01:12:09.570" style="s2">you know it&#39;s flowing it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.470" end="01:12:11.430" style="s2">like the group flow and so they&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.570" end="01:12:14.130" style="s2">that makes sense to me because you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.430" end="01:12:16.230" style="s2">flow enhances your inside capacity it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.130" end="01:12:18.450" style="s2">ends well I would argue and it enhances</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.230" end="01:12:20.220" style="s2">your capacity to pick up on very complex</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.450" end="01:12:22.230" style="s2">implicit patterns which of course you</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.220" end="01:12:24.090" style="s2">need encircling that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.230" end="01:12:25.530" style="s2">challenge think about it the chair and</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.090" end="01:12:28.470" style="s2">that goes back to the connectivity issue</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.530" end="01:12:30.180" style="s2">the challenge encircling is too you</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.470" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t like keeping working</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.180" end="01:12:35.130" style="s2">memory the complexity of the patterns in</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:36.390" style="s2">the group but you your people they</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.130" end="01:12:38.670" style="s2">resort to there&#39;s like well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.390" end="01:12:40.110" style="s2">sensing it right this is all intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.670" end="01:12:42.030" style="s2">languages the language of implicit</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.110" end="01:12:43.260" style="s2">processing and it&#39;s being really</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.030" end="01:12:45.620" style="s2">powerfully engaged so you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.260" end="01:12:48.180" style="s2">sort of flow in distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.620" end="01:12:50.070" style="s2">doing this thing you know about the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.180" end="01:12:52.730" style="s2">the novel restructuring of connectivity</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.070" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">all this stuff is speaking to me about</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.730" end="01:13:01.350" style="s2">really powerful enhancement of you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:03.240" style="s2">well activation and enhancement of</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.350" end="01:13:06.360" style="s2">collective intelligence what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.240" end="01:13:08.310" style="s2">interesting to me too is I haven&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.360" end="01:13:11.280" style="s2">well I think I&#39;ve experienced it in one</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.310" end="01:13:14.760" style="s2">of the circlings we did I got a sense I</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.280" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">don&#39;t I didn&#39;t ask other people yet and</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.760" end="01:13:17.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve read about it in the literature but</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:19.470" style="s2">people often talk about like almost like</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.820" end="01:13:21.570" style="s2">it this like like like what they used to</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.470" end="01:13:22.950" style="s2">talk about the third man factor that in</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.570" end="01:13:25.320" style="s2">addition to all the people there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.950" end="01:13:27.180" style="s2">other presence and some</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.320" end="01:13:30.390" style="s2">times people resort to spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.180" end="01:13:32.550" style="s2">language to talk about this but I in one</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.390" end="01:13:34.800" style="s2">of the circling I won&#39;t disclose any</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.550" end="01:13:36.630" style="s2">names for confidentiality but they would</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.800" end="01:13:38.760" style="s2">I got the very strong sense of their</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.630" end="01:13:40.980" style="s2">being right that there was something</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.760" end="01:13:43.050" style="s2">like I think this is just an aesthetic</p>

<p begin="01:13:46.200" end="01:13:50.550" style="s2">there was very much the sense of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.720" end="01:13:54.300" style="s2">there was something that centered in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.550" end="01:13:56.790" style="s2">room that was above and beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.300" end="01:13:58.560" style="s2">people there that was phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.790" end="01:14:00.270" style="s2">how was expressing itself to me and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.560" end="01:14:02.760" style="s2">think my brain was trying to make sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.270" end="01:14:05.330" style="s2">synesthetic Lee that&#39;s how I would put</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.760" end="01:14:11.810" style="s2">it of there of this of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.330" end="01:14:15.480" style="s2">emergent capacity to structure and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.810" end="01:14:17.550" style="s2">enhance cognition and and and like</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.480" end="01:14:19.410" style="s2">there&#39;s collective intelligence and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.550" end="01:14:21.450" style="s2">the brain is trying to like where the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.410" end="01:14:23.700" style="s2">hell is that coming from and I think you</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.450" end="01:14:25.080" style="s2">get that kind of experience and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.700" end="01:14:26.730" style="s2">really interesting to me because that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.080" end="01:14:28.590" style="s2">reminds me of a lot of the practices</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.730" end="01:14:30.390" style="s2">from the Neoplatonic tradition where</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.590" end="01:14:31.310" style="s2">people were dealing theoria and fear gia</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.390" end="01:14:33.900" style="s2">and they were talking about sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.310" end="01:14:36.150" style="s2">indicating spirits collectively and all</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.900" end="01:14:38.040" style="s2">this sort of stuff and it&#39;s like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.150" end="01:14:39.420" style="s2">even goes back to some maybe stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.040" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in shamanism because</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.420" end="01:14:42.600" style="s2">the shamans dancing at the center of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:45.030" style="s2">circle and there&#39;s all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.600" end="01:14:47.730" style="s2">happening so that&#39;s all of this is all</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.030" end="01:14:49.890" style="s2">tenuous right it&#39;s all I&#39;m just off you</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.730" end="01:14:52.080" style="s2">asked for my impressions and some and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.890" end="01:14:53.100" style="s2">there&#39;s some insights percolating in</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.080" end="01:14:56.280" style="s2">there and there&#39;s I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.100" end="01:14:59.190" style="s2">richness to be explored and I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.280" end="01:15:01.380" style="s2">it all very exciting is there anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.190" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">that frustrates you about the practice</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.380" end="01:15:04.980" style="s2">maybe something that you&#39;re like longing</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.880" end="01:15:06.720" style="s2">for it to have well yeah and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.980" end="01:15:08.520" style="s2">articulated this to the guy who created</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.720" end="01:15:11.850" style="s2">the practice and he&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.520" end="01:15:15.060" style="s2">responsive and sympathetic to it now</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.850" end="01:15:17.700" style="s2">when I say this I I want to be careful</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.060" end="01:15:20.850" style="s2">because I think I don&#39;t want to because</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.700" end="01:15:23.640" style="s2">I do respect the integrity of circling</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.850" end="01:15:26.460" style="s2">for its own sake right and I understand</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.640" end="01:15:27.900" style="s2">that but you asked me specifically so</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.460" end="01:15:30.600" style="s2">this is not what I would turn like a</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.900" end="01:15:32.220" style="s2">critique of circling as a thing this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.600" end="01:15:35.820" style="s2">something you&#39;re asking me for something</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.220" end="01:15:37.260" style="s2">that I would want I would want and this</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.820" end="01:15:38.910" style="s2">is what I&#39;m talking to guy about I would</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.260" end="01:15:41.790" style="s2">want to try and into</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.910" end="01:15:43.650" style="s2">great circling with via Sophia and</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.790" end="01:15:46.380" style="s2">Guyana are talking about this in depth</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.650" end="01:15:47.930" style="s2">to try and get something analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.380" end="01:15:51.030" style="s2">what I was talking to him about</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.930" end="01:15:54.290" style="s2">something like what photonic dialect was</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.030" end="01:15:58.440" style="s2">so that the circling is not just</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.290" end="01:16:03.480" style="s2">self-perpetuating right but it can be</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.440" end="01:16:07.260" style="s2">exempted for yeah do a addressing a</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.480" end="01:16:10.770" style="s2">topic like what is wisdom what is it to</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.260" end="01:16:12.870" style="s2">live well right now that the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.770" end="01:16:15.510" style="s2">dangerous you know to just degenerate</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.870" end="01:16:17.130" style="s2">into your opinions and blah blah but it</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.510" end="01:16:21.870" style="s2">would have to be it has to be genuinely</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.130" end="01:16:24.120" style="s2">an integration of circling right with</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.870" end="01:16:25.890" style="s2">some of the stuff that was in Socratic</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.120" end="01:16:28.260" style="s2">and Link it has to be very much what</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.890" end="01:16:30.660" style="s2">they took a long time to do in the h</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.260" end="01:16:32.880" style="s2">world but that is something I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.660" end="01:16:36.570" style="s2">see precisely because I think circling</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:38.310" style="s2">as it is is not the psycho technology</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.570" end="01:16:41.730" style="s2">the meta psycho technology that Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.310" end="01:16:42.960" style="s2">Hall wants it&#39;s like Jordan is also</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.730" end="01:16:44.640" style="s2">doing this thing that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:48.060" style="s2">integrated with circling that needs to</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.640" end="01:16:50.580" style="s2">be because he also right like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.060" end="01:16:52.830" style="s2">talking with Jordan it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.580" end="01:16:54.930" style="s2">circling but it can also be topical we</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.830" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">can write and there&#39;s the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.930" end="01:16:59.310" style="s2">moving between theory and Furion he and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:17:02.100" style="s2">I have been talking about that and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.310" end="01:17:04.350" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what and that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.100" end="01:17:06.630" style="s2">and I are working like an we well at</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.350" end="01:17:08.970" style="s2">least for my end of it like can we is</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.630" end="01:17:11.400" style="s2">their way of drawing these practices</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.970" end="01:17:13.470" style="s2">into some sort of synoptic integration</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.400" end="01:17:15.690" style="s2">not to make the disappear into a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.470" end="01:17:18.210" style="s2">homogenous core but so from that</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.690" end="01:17:21.300" style="s2">integration to exact something of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.210" end="01:17:25.170" style="s2">right emergent that can do the role that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.300" end="01:17:27.120" style="s2">we need the meta psycho technology right</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.170" end="01:17:29.700" style="s2">right and I think a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.120" end="01:17:31.350" style="s2">like independently attracted to to</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.700" end="01:17:33.420" style="s2">developing this and working towards that</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.350" end="01:17:36.510" style="s2">I know Tim in Australia he&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.420" end="01:17:39.330" style="s2">something similar to this as well um so</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.510" end="01:17:41.190" style="s2">we have the QA one out over the group</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.330" end="01:17:43.080" style="s2">discussions I think we&#39;ll just go for QA</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.190" end="01:17:47.040" style="s2">maybe for 50 more minutes we&#39;ll do a</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.080" end="01:17:48.630" style="s2">short kind of group closeout I just</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.040" end="01:17:50.070" style="s2">wanted to answer Jennifer&#39;s questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.630" end="01:17:52.650" style="s2">are there opportunities you circling</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.070" end="01:17:55.140" style="s2">online there is there something called</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.650" end="01:17:58.530" style="s2">the circle anywhere I believe I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.140" end="01:17:59.970" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s not my opinion is not as</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.530" end="01:18:01.410" style="s2">good as the impersonal circles but you</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.970" end="01:18:02.730" style="s2">do get a good taste that what circling</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.410" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">is like so you might want to double</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.730" end="01:18:05.900" style="s2">click on that I&#39;ll write down the link</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:08.490" style="s2">in a moment</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.900" end="01:18:15.480" style="s2">so that because there&#39;s any uh any other</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.490" end="01:18:22.460" style="s2">questions for John maybe someone who</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.480" end="01:18:22.460" style="s2">hasn&#39;t gone yet Eliot or Amy Amy</p>

<p begin="01:18:40.310" end="01:18:47.750" style="s2">Braemore at least you know like it is in</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.010" end="01:18:50.730" style="s2">peds</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.750" end="01:18:57.950" style="s2">normal discourse because it&#39;s really not</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.950" end="01:19:03.330" style="s2">interesting to most people to be honest</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.210" end="01:19:09.420" style="s2">and I think this ties in with your ideas</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.330" end="01:19:11.670" style="s2">or your analysis of centric and</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.420" end="01:19:14.220" style="s2"> on</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.670" end="01:19:18.300" style="s2">directed culture that I am wondering</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.220" end="01:19:20.160" style="s2">where the jumping off will be from the</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.300" end="01:19:22.860" style="s2">self-worth in the work within</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.160" end="01:19:24.360" style="s2">communities to the broader framework of</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.860" end="01:19:28.380" style="s2">dealing with society if you have any</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.360" end="01:19:30.300" style="s2">thoughts on that yeah I hope I got all</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.380" end="01:19:33.120" style="s2">of it you you broke up periodically some</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.300" end="01:19:36.750" style="s2">sort of background music so I hope I</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.120" end="01:19:42.030" style="s2">hope not I don&#39;t miss here you at any</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.750" end="01:19:44.640" style="s2">point yeah I do I don&#39;t have any I mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.030" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">so I gave some very tentative stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.640" end="01:19:48.750" style="s2">about that in in one episode where I</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:50.010" style="s2">sort of tried to introduce you know the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.750" end="01:19:53.280" style="s2">beginnings of the religion if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.010" end="01:19:57.810" style="s2">a religion precisely because I take this</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.280" end="01:20:00.240" style="s2">idea of I don&#39;t know what word to use</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.810" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">but the application and the scalability</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.240" end="01:20:05.130" style="s2">of the kinds of stuff we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:08.100" style="s2">about here very very seriously</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.130" end="01:20:10.130" style="s2">and and and and you know other people</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.100" end="01:20:12.090" style="s2">have made that criticism and I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.130" end="01:20:14.640" style="s2">justify would be so it&#39;s a criticism</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.090" end="01:20:17.220" style="s2">that Paul bender clay has made and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.640" end="01:20:27.180" style="s2">and he&#39;s put some good argument behind</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.220" end="01:20:29.960" style="s2">it so I guess there could because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.180" end="01:20:34.350" style="s2">point is and this is a the point is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.960" end="01:20:36.180" style="s2">we are asking for you know a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.350" end="01:20:37.950" style="s2">significant transformation of</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.180" end="01:20:40.470" style="s2">consciousness and cognition and in</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.950" end="01:20:43.530" style="s2">character if that&#39;s what aspiration will</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.470" end="01:20:45.300" style="s2">results in a change in right and and we</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.530" end="01:20:47.310" style="s2">need it and and we need it to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.300" end="01:20:48.960" style="s2">scalable but you know between kids and</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.310" end="01:20:51.450" style="s2">adults and between people in different</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.960" end="01:20:53.610" style="s2">socioeconomic stages at different stages</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.450" end="01:20:56.700" style="s2">and their careers etc and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.610" end="01:20:58.530" style="s2">really really complex problem it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:20:58.530" end="01:21:03.900" style="s2">things in the past that has done that</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.030" end="01:21:05.160" style="s2">for us such an religions that that seems</p>

<p begin="01:21:05.160" end="01:21:10.710" style="s2">succeeded to meet all of those demands</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.730" end="01:21:12.360" style="s2">the philosophical schools meet some of</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.710" end="01:21:15.090" style="s2">those demands but they don&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.360" end="01:21:20.160" style="s2">often not scalable try it in though in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.090" end="01:21:24.060" style="s2">comprehensive fashion and so the problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.160" end="01:21:27.270" style="s2">facing us I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t mean to</p>

<p begin="01:21:27.270" end="01:21:31.860" style="s2">for the for the problem facing many</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.940" end="01:21:35.430" style="s2">people who come to my series maybe I can</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.860" end="01:21:37.140" style="s2">put it that way is that the existing</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.430" end="01:21:38.610" style="s2">religions are not liable for them in</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.140" end="01:21:40.740" style="s2">James&#39;s sense they can sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.610" end="01:21:43.350" style="s2">understand them propositional II but</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.740" end="01:21:45.240" style="s2">they just they they&#39;re not they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:21:47.430" end="01:21:53.100" style="s2">don&#39;t afford the transformations and</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.490" end="01:21:55.320" style="s2">they&#39;re suspicious of a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.100" end="01:21:58.080" style="s2">politics and the metaphysics because</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.320" end="01:21:59.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what the research shows and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.080" end="01:22:01.500" style="s2">but the second or alternatives</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.700" end="01:22:02.940" style="s2">you know the totalitarian ideologies</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.500" end="01:22:05.430" style="s2">have also just wrenched the world and</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.940" end="01:22:08.400" style="s2">blood and so those are not seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.430" end="01:22:11.210" style="s2">viable so many people feel and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:16.040" style="s2">this in a Jungian sense they feel stuck</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.210" end="01:22:16.040" style="s2">they feel stuck and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.440" end="01:22:21.180" style="s2">sorry all I&#39;m doing is making the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.969" end="01:22:23.219" style="s2">problem more I&#39;m just formulating the</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.180" end="01:22:25.260" style="s2">problem or rather than answering it but</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.219" end="01:22:28.830" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to do that</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.260" end="01:22:32.010" style="s2">before I I try to answer it so what what</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.830" end="01:22:33.600" style="s2">I try to talk about is how could we go</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.010" end="01:22:36.000" style="s2">about trying to create a religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.600" end="01:22:38.670" style="s2">not a religion that could have all of</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:42.900" style="s2">that functionality without becoming</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.670" end="01:22:45.750" style="s2">either a totalitarian ideology or just</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.900" end="01:22:49.469" style="s2">becoming some nostalgic version of one</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.750" end="01:22:52.680" style="s2">of the existing religions and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.469" end="01:22:55.350" style="s2">have a complete answer to that or</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.680" end="01:22:57.960" style="s2">anything that even sounds too weak I</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.350" end="01:22:59.160" style="s2">have a very tentative partial answer</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.960" end="01:23:03.540" style="s2">about how to start moving in that</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.160" end="01:23:10.410" style="s2">direction largely because of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.540" end="01:23:12.570" style="s2">seen emerging for me if people coming to</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.410" end="01:23:14.010" style="s2">me like sorry my awareness is emergent</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.570" end="01:23:15.989" style="s2">not the phenomena I guess the phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.010" end="01:23:17.610" style="s2">is also emerging well I&#39;m coming into</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.989" end="01:23:20.040" style="s2">contact with more and more communities</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.610" end="01:23:23.340" style="s2">where people are putting time and talent</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.040" end="01:23:26.250" style="s2">and effort into creating things that are</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.340" end="01:23:28.050" style="s2">scalable that are livable</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.250" end="01:23:29.820" style="s2">you know ecologies of practices</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.050" end="01:23:33.810" style="s2">responding to the meeting crisis and</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.820" end="01:23:37.940" style="s2">what I what I would like to do is to</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.810" end="01:23:40.199" style="s2">take all of the cuz you know all of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.940" end="01:23:41.699" style="s2">conceptual vocabulary theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.199" end="01:23:43.230" style="s2">grammar because this is how its already</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.699" end="01:23:46.290" style="s2">already being used and put it in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.230" end="01:23:49.650" style="s2">service to try and facilitate something</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.290" end="01:23:51.989" style="s2">like forming you know a co-op between</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.650" end="01:23:54.900" style="s2">these groups so that they can talk to</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.989" end="01:23:57.540" style="s2">each other and and that and inform each</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.900" end="01:23:59.730" style="s2">other and that sounds kind of woowoo but</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.540" end="01:24:01.739" style="s2">like I said I&#39;ve already had practice in</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.730" end="01:24:04.380" style="s2">that at least to some degree as a</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.739" end="01:24:06.150" style="s2">cognitive scientist bridging between you</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.380" end="01:24:08.520" style="s2">know the different worlds and languages</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.150" end="01:24:10.050" style="s2">and practices of psychologists and</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.520" end="01:24:11.640" style="s2">neuroscientists and they all are</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.050" end="01:24:13.650" style="s2">committed to their own ontology in their</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.640" end="01:24:16.590" style="s2">own methodology and yet they have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.650" end="01:24:18.150" style="s2">come to see the value of opening up to</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.590" end="01:24:19.739" style="s2">being you know track to having</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.150" end="01:24:22.739" style="s2">transformative interactions with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.739" end="01:24:28.800" style="s2">other disciplines so trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.739" end="01:24:30.369" style="s2">something like that and I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.800" end="01:24:33.129" style="s2">working with Daniel Craig on</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.369" end="01:24:41.669" style="s2">that next year to try and actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.129" end="01:24:43.929" style="s2">create it and to try and also you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.669" end="01:24:47.649" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s gonna need something like</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.929" end="01:24:49.239" style="s2">a Creed a philosophy but I think that</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.649" end="01:24:50.679" style="s2">should be generated into some collective</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.239" end="01:24:52.059" style="s2">intelligent manner we now have the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.679" end="01:24:54.099" style="s2">technology where we could create sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.059" end="01:24:58.209" style="s2">like a wiki creed rather than any</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.099" end="01:25:00.280" style="s2">top-down in position and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.209" end="01:25:03.249" style="s2">the bottom-up co-op and the top-down</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.280" end="01:25:04.629" style="s2">wiki could also be in discourse with</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.249" end="01:25:09.780" style="s2">each other and then in discourse with</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.629" end="01:25:12.070" style="s2">the perhaps cognitive science and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.780" end="01:25:15.939" style="s2">look at my hands I&#39;m waving my hands a</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.070" end="01:25:18.429" style="s2">lot maybe that could give us something</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.939" end="01:25:23.139" style="s2">that could address your concern that</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.429" end="01:25:25.689" style="s2">could right give us the functionality</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.139" end="01:25:27.159" style="s2">that could be comprehensively</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.689" end="01:25:29.829" style="s2">transformative of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.159" end="01:25:30.789" style="s2">cognition character and communitas is</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.829" end="01:25:33.699" style="s2">what we have together right now</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.789" end="01:25:36.070" style="s2">communitas the that shared collective</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.699" end="01:25:40.840" style="s2">intelligence but in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.070" end="01:25:43.539" style="s2">scalable across write different socio</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.840" end="01:25:45.309" style="s2">economic and social distinctions and</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.539" end="01:25:51.579" style="s2">also developmentally scalable from</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.309" end="01:25:57.280" style="s2">children to adults that would be that</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.579" end="01:25:58.479" style="s2">would be well it was sorry let me let me</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.280" end="01:26:00.399" style="s2">drop that students because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.479" end="01:26:02.079" style="s2">to say that sentence that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.399" end="01:26:04.209" style="s2">goal I&#39;m working towards whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.079" end="01:26:09.189" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately possible I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.209" end="01:26:11.590" style="s2">yet but that&#39;s my take your question</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.189" end="01:26:14.320" style="s2">very seriously and I&#39;m working with a</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.590" end="01:26:16.510" style="s2">lot of people to try and go beyond</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.320" end="01:26:19.179" style="s2">talking about an answer and actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.510" end="01:26:21.489" style="s2">trying to create an answer precisely</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.179" end="01:26:22.959" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know like it&#39;s very the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.489" end="01:26:26.369" style="s2">situation where there&#39;s very urgent and</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.959" end="01:26:34.300" style="s2">so your question I think is also thereby</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.369" end="01:26:43.390" style="s2">very very urgent as well thank you</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.300" end="01:26:45.100" style="s2">so I&#39;m just Elliot hey um so I&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.390" end="01:26:47.670" style="s2">mentioned interdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.100" end="01:26:52.390" style="s2">conversations and psychologists are</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.670" end="01:26:54.220" style="s2">silencer and I&#39;m wondering I basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.390" end="01:26:56.440" style="s2">about how you think of the role of</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.220" end="01:26:59.110" style="s2">empirical research in this whole project</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.440" end="01:27:02.170" style="s2">and since it&#39;s things like lose them in</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.110" end="01:27:03.970" style="s2">awe are so complex and multifaceted I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.170" end="01:27:05.920" style="s2">had a hard time operationalizing some of</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.970" end="01:27:08.350" style="s2">them I do some work with with awe and</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.920" end="01:27:10.300" style="s2">they keep coming up into this problem</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.350" end="01:27:11.920" style="s2">where I&#39;m getting more involved in</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.300" end="01:27:15.280" style="s2">interdisciplinary stuff talking with</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.920" end="01:27:18.010" style="s2">humanities in and out of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.280" end="01:27:21.280" style="s2">that you want to get at is the only way</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.010" end="01:27:23.140" style="s2">to extract it out of people is to to</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.280" end="01:27:24.940" style="s2">talk to them and in ways that and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.140" end="01:27:27.490" style="s2">know empirical psychology really deals</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.940" end="01:27:31.210" style="s2">with such distillation of this and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.490" end="01:27:33.160" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering sort of the if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.210" end="01:27:36.700" style="s2">sense of some of the best work you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.160" end="01:27:38.860" style="s2">of in that space or maybe if the best</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.700" end="01:27:41.380" style="s2">approach that you could imagine if it</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.860" end="01:27:47.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t yet exist yeah so let&#39;s do off</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.380" end="01:27:48.940" style="s2">because so I like I think what you got</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.140" end="01:27:51.940" style="s2">in some of the world so Gallagher&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.940" end="01:27:53.400" style="s2">on off I think with some of the most</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.940" end="01:27:56.530" style="s2">interesting work on bringing together</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.400" end="01:27:58.690" style="s2">right the you know a phenomenological a</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.530" end="01:28:00.580" style="s2">philosophical phenomenological aspect</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.690" end="01:28:02.830" style="s2">and a direct experimental intervention</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.580" end="01:28:05.500" style="s2">but also qualitative research and</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.830" end="01:28:09.130" style="s2">self-report so they were trauma dating</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.500" end="01:28:11.290" style="s2">so right there studying off and what</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.130" end="01:28:13.690" style="s2">they did was design what they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.290" end="01:28:15.660" style="s2">do was make use of the overview effect</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.690" end="01:28:18.160" style="s2">do you know about the overview effect</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.660" end="01:28:21.310" style="s2">and so what they did is they created a</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.160" end="01:28:23.590" style="s2">mixed reality that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.310" end="01:28:26.290" style="s2">metaphysical as it sounds it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.590" end="01:28:29.050" style="s2">but it&#39;s simultaneously physical object</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.290" end="01:28:30.490" style="s2">reality and a virtual reality so that</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.050" end="01:28:31.950" style="s2">people had the experience the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.490" end="01:28:34.510" style="s2">experience of astronauts in space</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.950" end="01:28:36.820" style="s2">because the overview effect tends to</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.510" end="01:28:39.880" style="s2">elicit pretty reliably experiences of</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.820" end="01:28:41.530" style="s2">awe and then what they did so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.880" end="01:28:45.120" style="s2">experimental situation but what they</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.530" end="01:28:47.769" style="s2">also came at it from a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.120" end="01:28:49.570" style="s2">framework so what they did is they did</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.769" end="01:28:51.820" style="s2">basically a kind of an in-depth</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.570" end="01:28:54.010" style="s2">phenomenological analysis on a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.820" end="01:28:56.320" style="s2">the previous reports and out of that</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.010" end="01:28:57.670" style="s2">they generated sets of questions that</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.320" end="01:29:00.130" style="s2">they were then going to bring into the</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.670" end="01:29:02.289" style="s2">experimental situation and so they only</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.130" end="01:29:04.269" style="s2">had self reports but they also were</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.289" end="01:29:08.230" style="s2">taking some measures now the one</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.269" end="01:29:11.079" style="s2">criticism I had is they largely did sort</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.230" end="01:29:12.489" style="s2">of neurological measures like EEG and</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.079" end="01:29:14.349" style="s2">things like that to go with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.489" end="01:29:17.619" style="s2">self-report I would have liked it if</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.349" end="01:29:19.119" style="s2">they had done some cognitive tasks as</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.619" end="01:29:20.380" style="s2">well like you know do you have more</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.119" end="01:29:22.090" style="s2">cognitive flexibility are you more</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.380" end="01:29:24.429" style="s2">insightful or are you less egocentric</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.090" end="01:29:26.949" style="s2">and we have you know experimental ways</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.429" end="01:29:28.749" style="s2">of testing that but there&#39;s no reason in</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.949" end="01:29:31.300" style="s2">principle why what why those couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.749" end="01:29:33.760" style="s2">brought into that experimental situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.300" end="01:29:35.679" style="s2">and so I think if you were if you could</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.760" end="01:29:37.420" style="s2">sort of improve it a little bit that</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.679" end="01:29:39.820" style="s2">seems to me to be sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.420" end="01:29:43.150" style="s2">really exemplary work for bringing</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.820" end="01:29:46.409" style="s2">together phenomenology experimental</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.150" end="01:29:48.969" style="s2">intervention qualitative work</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.409" end="01:29:51.429" style="s2">qualitative research and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.969" end="01:29:57.010" style="s2">and then there was and then they cycled</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.429" end="01:29:59.110" style="s2">back to through the phenomenology back</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.010" end="01:30:02.619" style="s2">to sort of four ecard native science as</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.110" end="01:30:04.150" style="s2">a way of trying to provide they do the</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.619" end="01:30:05.739" style="s2">philosophical work of laying out a</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.150" end="01:30:07.749" style="s2">framework by which they&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.739" end="01:30:10.210" style="s2">and interpret the results so I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.749" end="01:30:12.429" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good example of that</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.210" end="01:30:14.260" style="s2">kind of work being done on something as</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.429" end="01:30:21.090" style="s2">as you said that seems very nebulous</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.260" end="01:30:21.090" style="s2">like ah all right thanks</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.290" end="01:30:31.850" style="s2">so the people haven&#39;t yet maybe Jennifer</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.430" end="01:30:35.259" style="s2">Antoine you guys have any questions</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.850" end="01:30:35.259" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.010" end="01:30:51.800" style="s2">Antoine I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.850" end="01:30:51.800" style="s2">something but we can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.070" end="01:31:03.090" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.950" end="01:31:05.370" style="s2">okay no Ryan when he says influenced</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.090" end="01:31:10.500" style="s2">aceptas Mike do you have a question</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.370" end="01:31:16.770" style="s2">we&#39;re probably saying you had one all</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.500" end="01:31:18.810" style="s2">right for me or for Mike get the right</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.770" end="01:31:22.110" style="s2">if you have a question oh you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.810" end="01:31:24.120" style="s2">not everyone yeah yes so um mine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.110" end="01:31:27.780" style="s2">actually kind of going off of what amy</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.120" end="01:31:30.090" style="s2">was asking um and it&#39;s like thinking</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.780" end="01:31:32.580" style="s2">about sort of forward facing into the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.090" end="01:31:35.000" style="s2">future where it seems like it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.580" end="01:31:40.530" style="s2">good thing to have more people develop</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.000" end="01:31:42.150" style="s2">wisdom I&#39;m curious because like I I</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.530" end="01:31:43.860" style="s2">coming I&#39;m coming from the rationality</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.150" end="01:31:45.180" style="s2">movement and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.860" end="01:31:48.240" style="s2">we&#39;re finding is we&#39;re trying to teach</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.180" end="01:31:50.070" style="s2">rationality to people is that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.240" end="01:31:51.720" style="s2">people just don&#39;t care about it and they</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.070" end="01:31:54.050" style="s2">sort of are happy with the way that</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.720" end="01:31:57.150" style="s2">things are and don&#39;t feel drawn to</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.050" end="01:32:00.090" style="s2">personal growth in necessarily that form</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.150" end="01:32:01.980" style="s2">or other forms I&#39;m curious about your</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.090" end="01:32:03.930" style="s2">thoughts on wisdom do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.980" end="01:32:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s something that people are drawn to</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.930" end="01:32:09.780" style="s2">or that if we want to help create a more</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.440" end="01:32:13.580" style="s2">wise Society we might actually have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.780" end="01:32:15.810" style="s2">start like pushing people towards wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.580" end="01:32:16.290" style="s2">yeah so I think that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.810" end="01:32:19.110" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.290" end="01:32:20.670" style="s2">and I&#39;ve had some experience with like</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.110" end="01:32:24.900" style="s2">critical thinking workshops and things</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.670" end="01:32:27.990" style="s2">like that about trying to get people</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.900" end="01:32:29.880" style="s2">interested in rationality I think part</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.990" end="01:32:31.380" style="s2">of the reason why rationality isn&#39;t sexy</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.880" end="01:32:33.870" style="s2">to people is because of this thin</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.380" end="01:32:36.630" style="s2">truncated notion of rationality that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.870" end="01:32:40.440" style="s2">present to people because when I talk to</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.630" end="01:32:42.150" style="s2">people about wisdom and about dealing</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.440" end="01:32:44.190" style="s2">with self-deceptive self-destructive</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.150" end="01:32:45.929" style="s2">behavior in their life people Oh tell me</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.190" end="01:32:48.239" style="s2">more they want to know more and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.929" end="01:32:51.900" style="s2">like yeah you know my classes get filled</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.239" end="01:32:55.170" style="s2">up right about right away at U of T so</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.900" end="01:32:57.659" style="s2">you know and I get all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.170" end="01:33:05.190" style="s2">enthusiastic feedback or not it talked</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.659" end="01:33:07.620" style="s2">about these topics so part of part of</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.190" end="01:33:09.690" style="s2">why I&#39;m trying to reformulate to read</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.620" end="01:33:11.969" style="s2">the notion of rationality and include</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.690" end="01:33:14.550" style="s2">the aspiration to rationality as part of</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.969" end="01:33:18.480" style="s2">rationality is precisely to address that</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.550" end="01:33:22.530" style="s2">concern right because if if the</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.480" end="01:33:24.510" style="s2">attraction to wisdom remains separable</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.530" end="01:33:26.550" style="s2">from and then you know distinctly</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.510" end="01:33:27.719" style="s2">separable from the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.550" end="01:33:29.070" style="s2">rationality I think we&#39;re in deep</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.719" end="01:33:31.889" style="s2">trouble I think we&#39;re in deep trouble</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.070" end="01:33:35.070" style="s2">because I think we&#39;ll get an ocean of</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.889" end="01:33:37.199" style="s2">wisdom that&#39;s you know very romantic in</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.070" end="01:33:41.239" style="s2">the pejorative sense of the word and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.199" end="01:33:44.659" style="s2">that is a lot about you know a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.239" end="01:33:47.639" style="s2">assertive anti intellectualism and an</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.659" end="01:33:50.699" style="s2">assertive you know my gut is a magical</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.639" end="01:33:53.489" style="s2">entity that can tell me things that the</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.699" end="01:34:00.659" style="s2">fools around me can&#39;t see and that kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.489" end="01:34:02.670" style="s2">of so I&#39;m thinkin abut I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.659" end="01:34:04.139" style="s2">trying to say that that&#39;s explicitly why</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.670" end="01:34:07.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing things the way I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.139" end="01:34:10.949" style="s2">doing it I think really tight like it we</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.889" end="01:34:12.570" style="s2">really need to really tightly tie wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.949" end="01:34:16.290" style="s2">and rationality together and we need to</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.570" end="01:34:17.880" style="s2">really broaden why you would want to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.290" end="01:34:20.940" style="s2">wise and why that means you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.880" end="01:34:23.010" style="s2">want to be rational because rationality</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.940" end="01:34:25.050" style="s2">means to find reliable means for</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.010" end="01:34:28.230" style="s2">achieving goals you want a goal that</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.050" end="01:34:30.120" style="s2">people seem to want is to reduce their</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.230" end="01:34:33.420" style="s2">self-destructive behavior and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.120" end="01:34:34.650" style="s2">a very it&#39;s a very easy thing usually to</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.420" end="01:34:37.290" style="s2">get them to see that their</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.650" end="01:34:38.820" style="s2">self-destructive behavior is also driven</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.290" end="01:34:40.739" style="s2">by their self-deception and people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.820" end="01:34:41.940" style="s2">want to be self deceived and neither do</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.739" end="01:34:43.560" style="s2">they want to be vulnerable to being</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.940" end="01:34:45.659" style="s2">deceived by others they don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.560" end="01:34:47.969" style="s2">bullshitted if you present rationality</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.659" end="01:34:50.400" style="s2">to them as overcoming self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.969" end="01:34:53.340" style="s2">producing self-destruction</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.400" end="01:34:55.050" style="s2">chelating you against that</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.340" end="01:34:56.790" style="s2">makes it way more attractive to people</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.050" end="01:34:58.290" style="s2">if you present it to them justice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.790" end="01:35:00.360" style="s2">off and I&#39;m not accusing you of anything</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.290" end="01:35:02.190" style="s2">I&#39;m just answering your question right</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.360" end="01:35:03.930" style="s2">and if you presented weight standardly</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.190" end="01:35:06.630" style="s2">presented as a largely an epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.930" end="01:35:07.470" style="s2">project forgetting the truest possible</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.630" end="01:35:10.050" style="s2">belief she can</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.470" end="01:35:12.360" style="s2">most people are now like ah true I mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.050" end="01:35:14.670" style="s2">truth as a norm has become sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.360" end="01:35:17.100" style="s2">it&#39;s true for me and it&#39;s real for me</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.670" end="01:35:19.530" style="s2">and so that thing like why who cares</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.100" end="01:35:20.700" style="s2">right and so but then you say well do</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.530" end="01:35:22.080" style="s2">you want your partner to lie to you</p>

<p begin="01:35:43.380" end="01:35:47.190" style="s2">you know they&#39;re people but why do you</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.910" end="01:35:49.230" style="s2">want those things well here&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.190" end="01:35:51.300" style="s2">want those things right and the blob so</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.230" end="01:35:52.980" style="s2">that&#39;s that when I&#39;m teaching the course</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.300" end="01:35:55.530" style="s2">on the psychology wisdom and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.980" end="01:35:57.540" style="s2">huge chunk on the psychology of</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.530" end="01:36:00.540" style="s2">rationality because the theory of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.540" end="01:36:03.600" style="s2">I have he&#39;s embedded in an account of</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.540" end="01:36:05.250" style="s2">rationality that&#39;s that&#39;s how I it and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.600" end="01:36:07.530" style="s2">do stuff like have them do a journal</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.250" end="01:36:09.030" style="s2">project where they have to instead of</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.530" end="01:36:11.420" style="s2">talking just talking but active open</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.030" end="01:36:14.010" style="s2">mindedness I say no keep a journal and</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.420" end="01:36:16.350" style="s2">just try and you know and I do this</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.010" end="01:36:20.160" style="s2">practice myself try and find one or two</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.350" end="01:36:22.410" style="s2">instances in a day where you were you</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.160" end="01:36:24.990" style="s2">did the confirmation bias or you did the</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.410" end="01:36:26.880" style="s2">availability bias right and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.990" end="01:36:28.500" style="s2">surprising is how initially it&#39;s ago</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.880" end="01:36:29.970" style="s2">yeah and then they come back an oh crap</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.500" end="01:36:31.740" style="s2">and they get this like they get really</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.970" end="01:36:33.630" style="s2">enthusiastic about it because they start</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.740" end="01:36:35.100" style="s2">to see it in their lives and they start</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.630" end="01:36:38.160" style="s2">to see how it&#39;s sort of screwing up</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.100" end="01:36:40.230" style="s2">their interpersonal interactions and how</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.160" end="01:36:41.940" style="s2">it&#39;s you know really being detrimental</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.230" end="01:36:45.630" style="s2">to the goals they they think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.940" end="01:36:47.490" style="s2">trying to to realize so it&#39;s a long way</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.630" end="01:36:49.770" style="s2">of saying that you know you I think we</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.490" end="01:36:51.660" style="s2">have to get much more Socratic in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.770" end="01:36:55.260" style="s2">model of rationality and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.660" end="01:36:57.090" style="s2">teaching rationality hmm I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.260" end="01:36:59.490" style="s2">more specifically around the the realms</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.090" end="01:37:01.980" style="s2">of like I think there may be some people</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.490" end="01:37:03.930" style="s2">that are self deceived about their level</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.980" end="01:37:06.960" style="s2">of self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.930" end="01:37:11.190" style="s2">so so that&#39;s a that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.960" end="01:37:14.520" style="s2">that&#39;s where that&#39;s what you have to</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.190" end="01:37:17.430" style="s2">give way from self-report to you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.520" end="01:37:20.880" style="s2">some of the actual behavioral measures</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.430" end="01:37:23.190" style="s2">that Stanovich and others have have</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.880" end="01:37:25.170" style="s2">available that are available for us and</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.190" end="01:37:26.970" style="s2">you can show people self-deception like</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.170" end="01:37:29.010" style="s2">that&#39;s you know in the nine dot problem</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.970" end="01:37:30.900" style="s2">and I can&#39;t you solve this problem like</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.010" end="01:37:33.120" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know no you don&#39;t but here</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.900" end="01:37:36.000" style="s2">oh right like you have to do like you</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.120" end="01:37:37.830" style="s2">have to you so yeah totally so part of</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.000" end="01:37:40.440" style="s2">what I do before I do any of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.830" end="01:37:42.210" style="s2">is I have this dog-and-pony show showing</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.440" end="01:37:43.950" style="s2">all these instances where you know how</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.210" end="01:37:45.900" style="s2">you formulated the problem is preventing</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.950" end="01:37:47.970" style="s2">you from solving it or you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.900" end="01:37:50.400" style="s2">you using the availability heuristic</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.970" end="01:37:54.090" style="s2">here&#39;s you falling prey the confirmation</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.400" end="01:37:57.120" style="s2">like you know and so yeah I spend like a</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.090" end="01:38:01.140" style="s2">long time for first convincing people</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.120" end="01:38:04.650" style="s2">that sometimes it&#39;s it&#39;s you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.140" end="01:38:06.090" style="s2">you have to be it to be really jazz the</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.650" end="01:38:07.320" style="s2">a guy immediate provides so I had a</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.090" end="01:38:09.060" style="s2">student was like this usually are I</p>

<p begin="01:38:19.500" end="01:38:24.510" style="s2">ago and he said yeah and I said you saw</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.470" end="01:38:26.910" style="s2">the receptionist at the front desk he</p>

<p begin="01:38:33.930" end="01:38:38.690" style="s2">at what she was actually wearing and he</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.520" end="01:38:43.260" style="s2">was dead wrong and he just stood there</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.690" end="01:38:45.360" style="s2">anyway all right and then he changed he</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.260" end="01:38:49.770" style="s2">became one of my best students he became</p>

<p begin="01:38:55.710" end="01:38:58.770" style="s2">to do that without pissing people off</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.090" end="01:39:01.910" style="s2">and you know and even Socrates wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.770" end="01:39:01.910" style="s2">that good at it because they killed him</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.870" end="01:39:09.920" style="s2">but you know trying trying to do that</p>

<p begin="01:40:02.219" end="01:40:07.500" style="s2">works but I&#39;m not claiming that it works</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.500" end="01:40:13.590" style="s2">in any kind of comprehensive or you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.500" end="01:40:16.260" style="s2">perfect fashion yeah oh thank you okay</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.590" end="01:40:19.650" style="s2">so we have the cue of questions but I do</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.260" end="01:40:21.119" style="s2">want to leave time for for checkouts so</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.650" end="01:40:23.179" style="s2">we&#39;ll do one more question then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.119" end="01:40:25.199" style="s2">move over move on to the checkouts</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.179" end="01:40:52.739" style="s2">Antoine you&#39;ve been waiting for for a</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.199" end="01:40:55.159" style="s2">while so that&#39;s end with you almost the</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.739" end="01:40:58.650" style="s2">more productive the interaction</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.159" end="01:41:03.570" style="s2">eventually becomes or like the closer I</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.650" end="01:41:09.540" style="s2">think it almost seems to me like being</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.570" end="01:41:14.179" style="s2">ruthlessly forward with precisely direct</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.540" end="01:41:14.179" style="s2">and how you&#39;re trying to convey an idea</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.659" end="01:41:23.489" style="s2">you know there may be some fines it</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.489" end="01:41:28.010" style="s2">almost as if the more ruthless I am the</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.489" end="01:41:28.010" style="s2">more not ruthless has</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.690" end="01:41:38.650" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah I find when I&#39;m making my case</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.820" end="01:41:40.210" style="s2">as clearly and directly and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.650" end="01:41:47.230" style="s2">dispassionately as I can</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.210" end="01:41:49.090" style="s2">people tend to they may not they may not</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.230" end="01:41:51.760" style="s2">accept it but they won&#39;t drop into this</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.090" end="01:41:53.920" style="s2">this sort of state that you were just</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.760" end="01:41:59.619" style="s2">describing something like Trump talking</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.920" end="01:42:03.719" style="s2">getting into so how much and also see</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.619" end="01:42:08.800" style="s2">this as being another issue with with I</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.719" end="01:42:15.130" style="s2">think part of it this is keeping the</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.800" end="01:42:23.469" style="s2">value from possibly doing it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.130" end="01:42:26.190" style="s2">the imprecision you&#39;re frozen are you</p>

<p begin="01:43:07.060" end="01:43:11.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just impose on you either</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.680" end="01:43:13.420" style="s2">I want to try and understand so I think</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.680" end="01:43:18.160" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of ways in which people</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.420" end="01:43:19.510" style="s2">respond to certain signs because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.160" end="01:43:21.880" style="s2">what I think we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.510" end="01:43:23.920" style="s2">signs that you&#39;re being honest that</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.880" end="01:43:27.070" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re being that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.920" end="01:43:31.690" style="s2">stating what you believe and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.070" end="01:43:34.300" style="s2">important people also respond usually to</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.690" end="01:43:36.120" style="s2">markers that you&#39;re trying to be as</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.300" end="01:43:39.400" style="s2">clear as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.120" end="01:43:43.510" style="s2">and I think both of those I think are</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.400" end="01:43:46.150" style="s2">good what I&#39;m trying to get clear is how</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.510" end="01:43:48.100" style="s2">that becomes I&#39;m trying to like you I</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.150" end="01:43:49.060" style="s2">think you I&#39;m not sure if I heard the</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.100" end="01:43:52.150" style="s2">word right</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.060" end="01:43:52.990" style="s2">but you said like being blunt what do</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.150" end="01:43:54.970" style="s2">you mean by that</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.990" end="01:43:56.830" style="s2">because their word has different</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.970" end="01:43:59.650" style="s2">meanings one mean one meaning is you</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.830" end="01:44:00.970" style="s2">don&#39;t care how it affects people when</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.650" end="01:44:04.090" style="s2">you say what you say to them and</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.970" end="01:44:06.100" style="s2">generally that doesn&#39;t go well if people</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.090" end="01:44:08.590" style="s2">get a sense that you don&#39;t care how what</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.100" end="01:44:10.330" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is affecting them then</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.590" end="01:44:13.000" style="s2">they will take the same attitude back</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.330" end="01:44:15.670" style="s2">towards you people usually people I mean</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.000" end="01:44:18.040" style="s2">so people will default to tit-for-tat</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.670" end="01:44:20.410" style="s2">unless there&#39;s good reason not to right</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.040" end="01:44:22.900" style="s2">and so they did have said that that they</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.410" end="01:44:24.850" style="s2">get if they get a sense that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.900" end="01:44:27.490" style="s2">care about how your words are impacting</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.850" end="01:44:29.520" style="s2">them right then they will reciprocate</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.490" end="01:44:33.190" style="s2">and that generally breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.520" end="01:44:35.760" style="s2">communication quite quite quickly so the</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.190" end="01:44:37.540" style="s2">do you mean something other than that or</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.760" end="01:44:39.850" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.540" end="01:44:41.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what I meant but I</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.850" end="01:44:43.900" style="s2">think that if you&#39;re if what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.500" end="01:44:46.090" style="s2">saying is if you&#39;ve conveyed the truth</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.900" end="01:44:49.300" style="s2">of what you&#39;re saying properly enough</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.090" end="01:44:52.450" style="s2">most people are persuaded by it it</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.300" end="01:44:56.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like if sometimes to to present</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.450" end="01:44:58.840" style="s2">the most persuasive the most clear</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.140" end="01:45:03.310" style="s2">version of your case that you can I</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.840" end="01:45:07.890" style="s2">think you have to risk you have to just</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.310" end="01:45:11.520" style="s2">almost totally disregard someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.890" end="01:45:20.020" style="s2">immediate emotional reactions to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.520" end="01:45:23.590" style="s2">right is that clear okay so let me try</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.020" end="01:45:26.080" style="s2">and get it so I understand that</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.590" end="01:45:29.290" style="s2">sometimes people appreciate that you can</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.080" end="01:45:30.940" style="s2">say things that that might upset them if</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.290" end="01:45:32.350" style="s2">you&#39;re presenting it I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.940" end="01:45:33.370" style="s2">you have to do as an educator sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.350" end="01:45:35.500" style="s2">you have to say things that are going to</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.370" end="01:45:41.860" style="s2">upset people if you present it honestly</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.500" end="01:45:45.430" style="s2">and if you present it in a clear fashion</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.860" end="01:45:48.250" style="s2">however again and I had a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.430" end="01:45:49.600" style="s2">experience with this I&#39;m not so it&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.250" end="01:45:51.640" style="s2">not just talking off the top of my head</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.600" end="01:45:54.070" style="s2">because this is something I face you</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.640" end="01:45:58.120" style="s2">know classroom to classroom student to</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.070" end="01:46:01.300" style="s2">student generally people will allow you</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.120" end="01:46:05.680" style="s2">to do that if they feel that you are</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.300" end="01:46:07.720" style="s2">giving them some kind of tool if right</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.680" end="01:46:11.050" style="s2">if they are learning from you something</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.720" end="01:46:13.780" style="s2">that they can take away as a valuable</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.050" end="01:46:16.480" style="s2">practice if they feel that all you want</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.780" end="01:46:20.230" style="s2">is for them to adopt your particular set</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.480" end="01:46:23.860" style="s2">of beliefs generally again I tend to</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.230" end="01:46:25.030" style="s2">find that simply you know I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.860" end="01:46:28.210" style="s2">tell you the truth I don&#39;t care if it</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.030" end="01:46:32.400" style="s2">affects you that generally doesn&#39;t go as</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.210" end="01:46:35.800" style="s2">well I find that if I challenge people</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.400" end="01:46:38.830" style="s2">but they get a sense that the way that</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.800" end="01:46:41.380" style="s2">they&#39;re being challenged is giving them</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.830" end="01:46:44.320" style="s2">some tools and ways of thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.380" end="01:46:45.850" style="s2">they find valuable if the process is</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.320" end="01:46:48.010" style="s2">something they can take away and</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.850" end="01:46:49.750" style="s2">internalize rather than something that</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.010" end="01:46:51.440" style="s2">you&#39;re being sort of proprietary about</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.750" end="01:46:54.680" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to use it as a</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.440" end="01:46:57.410" style="s2">weapon against other people that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.680" end="01:46:59.360" style="s2">generally works for me but like I said</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.410" end="01:47:02.300" style="s2">if people just get a sense that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.360" end="01:47:33.860" style="s2">gonna convert you then that generally</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.300" end="01:47:37.449" style="s2">backfires for me sure well I mean well I</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.860" end="01:47:41.090" style="s2">want to challenge that and I&#39;m pleased</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.449" end="01:47:43.070" style="s2">is that because I don&#39;t think people are</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.090" end="01:47:45.020" style="s2">interested just cognitively and tools of</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.070" end="01:47:46.850" style="s2">truth they&#39;re also really interested in</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.020" end="01:47:49.250" style="s2">cognitive tools or relevance so you have</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.850" end="01:47:53.900" style="s2">to do stuff to make material relevant to</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.250" end="01:47:56.330" style="s2">people too and so I think perhaps that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.900" end="01:47:58.850" style="s2">what you also mean by clarity so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.330" end="01:48:02.300" style="s2">I might be I might be misrepresenting</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.850" end="01:48:04.489" style="s2">your position but I think other than if</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.300" end="01:48:07.040" style="s2">we mean by something more than just a</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.489" end="01:48:09.770" style="s2">lack of conceptual confusion by the way</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.040" end="01:48:13.520" style="s2">in which you&#39;re showing how the</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.770" end="01:48:16.430" style="s2">information is relevant to to them in</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.520" end="01:48:20.560" style="s2">some important fashion that you know I</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.430" end="01:48:23.480" style="s2">think is also very important that makes</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.560" end="01:48:26.570" style="s2">if I were to just start telling to you</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.480" end="01:48:28.010" style="s2">with really clear conviction without any</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.570" end="01:48:30.580" style="s2">kind of confusion a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.010" end="01:48:33.290" style="s2">disconnected truths and just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.580" end="01:48:34.790" style="s2">pouring them over you I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.290" end="01:48:38.030" style="s2">would hold your attention and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.790" end="01:48:40.699" style="s2">think you would appreciate me you know</p>

<p begin="01:48:40.699" end="01:48:54.469" style="s2">on stuff that isn&#39;t whose relevance and</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.730" end="01:48:58.449" style="s2">intelligibility isn&#39;t apparently someone</p>

<p begin="01:51:06.890" end="01:51:10.130" style="s2">is what&#39;s happening to me I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.360" end="01:51:12.020" style="s2">can&#39;t convey it I just can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.130" end="01:51:14.949" style="s2">there&#39;s too much I have to be selective</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.020" end="01:51:17.530" style="s2">and I think we should</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.949" end="01:51:23.410" style="s2">we should we should always remember that</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.530" end="01:51:25.000" style="s2">we always being selective and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.410" end="01:51:26.530" style="s2">accusing you of this but some of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.000" end="01:51:27.850" style="s2">time when I hear people talk well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.530" end="01:51:31.600" style="s2">just gonna speak the truth therefore</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.850" end="01:51:33.489" style="s2">they&#39;re forgetting that right they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.600" end="01:51:35.710" style="s2">jump out of the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.489" end="01:51:37.480" style="s2">framing they&#39;re selecting this is you</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.710" end="01:51:38.800" style="s2">know this is stuff that&#39;s come from the</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.480" end="01:51:42.340" style="s2">heart of the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.800" end="01:51:45.610" style="s2">there is no view from nowhere from which</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.340" end="01:51:47.110" style="s2">you can state things so maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.610" end="01:51:48.780" style="s2">what you meant by paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.110" end="01:51:51.489" style="s2">the context of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.780" end="01:51:57.219" style="s2">within the context of a conversation yes</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.489" end="01:51:59.380" style="s2">but I think I mean here&#39;s where I think</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.219" end="01:52:00.910" style="s2">we&#39;re not paying enough attention even</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.380" end="01:52:03.820" style="s2">theoretically to the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.910" end="01:52:05.410" style="s2">conversations I think we&#39;re not caring</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.820" end="01:52:07.780" style="s2">about the context of our conversations</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.410" end="01:52:10.060" style="s2">enough and that&#39;s part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.780" end="01:52:13.630" style="s2">they&#39;re breaking down into shouting</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.060" end="01:52:16.239" style="s2">matches because we&#39;re forgetting a lot</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.630" end="01:52:19.420" style="s2">of this other machinery the machinery of</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.239" end="01:52:30.489" style="s2">relevance that allows us to Center our</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.420" end="01:52:32.860" style="s2">attention together all right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.489" end="01:52:33.310" style="s2">almost at the end and I usually like to</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.860" end="01:52:35.530" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.310" end="01:52:38.140" style="s2">checkouts I did notice that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.530" end="01:52:40.090" style="s2">new visitor in the the chat room guy</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.140" end="01:52:45.040" style="s2">sense ock just joined us</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.090" end="01:52:48.179" style="s2">hey Gary they&#39;re busy there yeah this is</p>

<p begin="01:53:07.440" end="01:53:14.440" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s good to see you you see</p>

<p begin="01:53:17.230" end="01:53:24.100" style="s2">so I usually like just to go around and</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.380" end="01:53:25.690" style="s2">maybe say a question or a statement like</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.100" end="01:53:27.670" style="s2">we&#39;ll lean on the concise sides would be</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.690" end="01:53:28.840" style="s2">able six minutes about like something</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.670" end="01:53:30.720" style="s2">that feels alive for you</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.840" end="01:53:32.890" style="s2">stuff what we heard today and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.720" end="01:53:35.620" style="s2">hand it over to John for closing</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.890" end="01:53:37.150" style="s2">thoughts so I&#39;ll go first and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.620" end="01:53:38.890" style="s2">I&#39;ll just take someone and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.150" end="01:53:42.670" style="s2">go then they&#39;ll take someone then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.890" end="01:53:45.370" style="s2">just go around the room so what&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.670" end="01:53:47.680" style="s2">for me right now is I&#39;m engaging in this</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.370" end="01:53:52.990" style="s2">letter wiki exchange with Andrew Taggert</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.680" end="01:53:54.340" style="s2">on sort of a DIY ecology of practices so</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.990" end="01:53:56.350" style="s2">until we get to this point where we have</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.340" end="01:53:57.610" style="s2">like a robust scientific understanding</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.350" end="01:54:00.220" style="s2">of what was the best ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.610" end="01:54:03.400" style="s2">practices or until these monasteries are</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.220" end="01:54:05.020" style="s2">like you know bearing fruit what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.400" end="01:54:07.750" style="s2">most wisest way to design our own</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.020" end="01:54:10.290" style="s2">ecology of practices so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.750" end="01:54:27.160" style="s2">question I&#39;m going to be noodling with</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.290" end="01:54:29.190" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to take in Jennifer hi you</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.160" end="01:54:33.400" style="s2">know I&#39;ve been thinking a lot recently</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.190" end="01:54:36.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve had experience with somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.400" end="01:54:38.890" style="s2">has a mental disorder so I guess a lot</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.160" end="01:54:41.170" style="s2">of the time a lot of what I&#39;m hearing in</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.890" end="01:54:43.870" style="s2">this conversation and I guess in my own</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.170" end="01:54:49.240" style="s2">brain I&#39;m thinking about meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.870" end="01:54:52.120" style="s2">truth and how he would process that and</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.240" end="01:54:55.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the whole the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.120" end="01:54:59.140" style="s2">is kind of broken and I guess I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.480" end="01:55:05.740" style="s2">kind of thinking about in the society we</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.140" end="01:55:08.520" style="s2">have today people people with some real</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.740" end="01:55:12.070" style="s2">mental problems and the challenges that</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.520" end="01:55:15.820" style="s2">kind of poses for the culture and our</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.070" end="01:55:20.130" style="s2">society at large as far as collective</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.820" end="01:55:24.490" style="s2">intelligence and since making an agency</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.130" end="01:55:25.870" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a downer but that and I</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.490" end="01:55:27.310" style="s2">don&#39;t really know how it relates to</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.870" end="01:55:31.480" style="s2">anything else we said here but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.310" end="01:55:32.740" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in my head and if you</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.480" end="01:55:34.080" style="s2">could pick the next person to go</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.740" end="01:55:37.290" style="s2">Jennifer</p>

<p begin="01:55:38.909" end="01:55:45.400" style="s2">all right what&#39;s feeling pretty live for</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.390" end="01:55:47.770" style="s2">me right now is actually I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.400" end="01:55:50.170" style="s2">about the contexts of everybody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.770" end="01:55:53.620" style="s2">actually attending this session like</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.170" end="01:55:56.199" style="s2">what is it that&#39;s drawing all of us</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.620" end="01:55:57.070" style="s2">together to be on this chat with each</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.199" end="01:55:58.719" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.070" end="01:56:03.820" style="s2">I know on the surface it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.719" end="01:56:05.500" style="s2">about John for baekje and wisdom but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.820" end="01:56:07.690" style="s2">just imagining like there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.500" end="01:56:09.429" style="s2">world behind me that&#39;s bringing me here</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.690" end="01:56:11.710" style="s2">sitting in front of this computer just</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.429" end="01:56:13.780" style="s2">like being very curious about things and</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.710" end="01:56:16.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to get a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.780" end="01:56:16.989" style="s2">snippets from each person&#39;s life with</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.060" end="01:56:19.300" style="s2">the questions that you&#39;ve been asking</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.989" end="01:56:21.370" style="s2">and noticing how they&#39;re all different</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.300" end="01:56:24.219" style="s2">but like deeply relevant to each one of</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.370" end="01:56:25.870" style="s2">you and so I&#39;m sitting here just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.219" end="01:56:28.050" style="s2">wondering what it&#39;s like for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.870" end="01:56:31.239" style="s2">else behind your own computer screens</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.050" end="01:56:37.110" style="s2">and so I&#39;m really enjoying my most check</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.239" end="01:56:37.110" style="s2">out and I am going to tag in Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.669" end="01:56:51.839" style="s2">that I can&#39;t hear you Jordan okay maybe</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.589" end="01:56:58.289" style="s2">we can take in Mike well Jordan get this</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.839" end="01:57:01.319" style="s2">thing set up yeah I&#39;m uh I feel sort of</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.289" end="01:57:04.229" style="s2">percolating was that felt like one of</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.319" end="01:57:06.329" style="s2">the last pieces John mentioned within</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.229" end="01:57:10.199" style="s2">that relationship with having truth</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.329" end="01:57:13.439" style="s2">without relevance realization and vice</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.199" end="01:57:16.919" style="s2">versa that&#39;s sort of dynamic importance</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.439" end="01:57:20.339" style="s2">of holding holding both the should have</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.919" end="01:57:24.300" style="s2">depth of care John seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.339" end="01:57:29.159" style="s2">championing for attending to the context</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.300" end="01:57:31.050" style="s2">of the interactions that were feels yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.159" end="01:57:32.429" style="s2">there&#39;s a good a good place to see the</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.050" end="01:57:38.039" style="s2">rest of my attention and see where it</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.429" end="01:57:38.939" style="s2">comes comes alive there so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.039" end="01:57:49.260" style="s2">up for me</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.939" end="01:57:50.159" style="s2">what are you uh fortunate you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.260" end="01:57:51.569" style="s2">think I&#39;m back now</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.159" end="01:57:54.059" style="s2">there you go you&#39;re yeah you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.569" end="01:57:57.959" style="s2">right so I guess the two things are</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.059" end="01:57:58.469" style="s2">similar to was just said I&#39;m I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.959" end="01:58:02.099" style="s2">this idea</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.469" end="01:58:04.289" style="s2">Oh what would happen or what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.099" end="01:58:07.589" style="s2">potential in paying more attention to</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.289" end="01:58:09.839" style="s2">relevance it&#39;s in addition to truth just</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.589" end="01:58:11.519" style="s2">like in him on a moment-to-moment basis</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.839" end="01:58:13.379" style="s2">when you&#39;re conversing with people and</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.519" end="01:58:15.179" style="s2">the other thing is something that was</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.379" end="01:58:17.459" style="s2">not really delved into just mentioned as</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.179" end="01:58:21.419" style="s2">part of a meditative practice by John is</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.459" end="01:58:23.550" style="s2">the I think it&#39;s the like the</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.419" end="01:58:24.629" style="s2">internalizing of the sage practice I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.550" end="01:58:26.369" style="s2">heard about that before and it got</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.629" end="01:58:27.780" style="s2">mentioned again so now it&#39;s back in my</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.369" end="01:58:34.669" style="s2">mind they kind of want to give it give</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.780" end="01:58:34.669" style="s2">it a crack and I&#39;ll pass it on to Tim</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.600" end="01:58:40.230" style="s2">cool Thank You Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.310" end="01:58:49.690" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s coming up for me is to tie</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.680" end="01:58:54.310" style="s2">together a few of what&#39;s being present</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.690" end="01:58:57.400" style="s2">in this check out there was mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.310" end="01:59:00.040" style="s2">by Jennifer of the difficulty of what to</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.400" end="01:59:04.180" style="s2">do about all of this in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.040" end="01:59:09.370" style="s2">with someone who for whatever reason if</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.180" end="01:59:12.570" style="s2">we can say broadly is not in some degree</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.370" end="01:59:17.020" style="s2">does not have some capacity currently</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.570" end="01:59:20.250" style="s2">extent to involve themselves with what</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.020" end="01:59:24.220" style="s2">it is we seem to be circling around as</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.250" end="01:59:28.030" style="s2">valuable and then this ties in a little</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.220" end="01:59:30.130" style="s2">bit with Narayan your interest and</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.030" end="01:59:33.070" style="s2">curiosity but the context is bringing us</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.130" end="01:59:36.400" style="s2">all here and it strikes me that the</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.070" end="01:59:40.440" style="s2">context that we each perhaps might share</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.400" end="01:59:47.110" style="s2">is of course very very simple which is</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.440" end="01:59:49.300" style="s2">some sort of deeply deeply seeded need</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.110" end="01:59:51.730" style="s2">and desire to be in relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.300" end="01:59:54.760" style="s2">each other a certain developmental</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.730" end="01:59:59.350" style="s2">relationship of care and the sense I get</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.760" end="02:00:03.310" style="s2">is that we&#39;re all attempting to realize</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.350" end="02:00:05.920" style="s2">better ways of entering into those</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.310" end="02:00:07.990" style="s2">relationships with each other and those</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.920" end="02:00:10.990" style="s2">we encounter in our lives and the world</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.990" end="02:00:14.410" style="s2">and the final piece is just well how</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.990" end="02:00:16.960" style="s2">like what how how do we do that better</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.410" end="02:00:19.060" style="s2">what are the conditions to enter into</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.960" end="02:00:20.890" style="s2">this kind of relationship with people</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.060" end="02:00:23.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I think about a lot and</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.890" end="02:00:27.220" style="s2">I think in some fundamental sense</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.380" end="02:00:29.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know it&#39;s you it has to be</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.220" end="02:00:33.420" style="s2">a mutual buy-in right there&#39;s a mutual</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.410" end="02:00:36.700" style="s2">buy-in you can&#39;t change anyone without</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.420" end="02:00:38.410" style="s2">engaging yourself in the transformative</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.700" end="02:00:41.950" style="s2">practice with them and that&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.410" end="02:00:44.080" style="s2">mutually sovereign thing and the only</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.950" end="02:00:49.620" style="s2">final thing to say is that it seems to</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.080" end="02:00:49.620" style="s2">me that a certain certain sort of</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.719" end="02:01:00.150" style="s2">fundamental loving openness as a</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.599" end="02:01:02.139" style="s2">presence is perhaps what enables someone</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.150" end="02:01:04.030" style="s2">even in the very depths of this</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.139" end="02:01:08.019" style="s2">connection to feel in that kind of</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.030" end="02:01:11.289" style="s2">contextual way to feel somehow in that</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.019" end="02:01:14.170" style="s2">non propositional way that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.289" end="02:01:16.389" style="s2">third there&#39;s a fertility to the setting</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.170" end="02:01:19.059" style="s2">of their experience which they may be</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.389" end="02:01:22.360" style="s2">able to participate in and so yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.059" end="02:01:26.909" style="s2">suggest that love is knocking away in</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.360" end="02:01:26.909" style="s2">there is something very important and</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.210" end="02:01:37.000" style="s2">perhaps Jake if you go next</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.340" end="02:01:38.770" style="s2">sure thank you the question that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.000" end="02:01:41.050" style="s2">leaving with are all kind of about</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.770" end="02:01:43.659" style="s2">ethics and how to think about ethics in</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.050" end="02:01:45.880" style="s2">light of wisdom amend this kind of</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.659" end="02:01:48.820" style="s2">different view of what what rationality</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.880" end="02:01:50.590" style="s2">and and knowledge mean because I do feel</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.820" end="02:01:52.719" style="s2">like ethics kind of occupies a weird</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.590" end="02:01:54.010" style="s2">space between some of the different</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.719" end="02:01:56.949" style="s2">kinds of knowing that you talk about</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.010" end="02:01:58.360" style="s2">so I&#39;m tempted to say there&#39;s a truth in</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.949" end="02:01:59.619" style="s2">ethics in the same way that there would</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.360" end="02:02:02.170" style="s2">be in science but there&#39;s also obviously</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.619" end="02:02:04.929" style="s2">ethical experience there&#39;s there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.170" end="02:02:09.760" style="s2">kind of participatory quality to ethics</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.929" end="02:02:12.130" style="s2">and you know I I can never kind of</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.760" end="02:02:14.110" style="s2">escape the specter of many people who</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.130" end="02:02:16.599" style="s2">seem to have gone very far down a wisdom</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.110" end="02:02:18.520" style="s2">path who nevertheless end up behaving</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.599" end="02:02:20.409" style="s2">and kind of ethically dubious ways in</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.520" end="02:02:23.980" style="s2">fact reliably seem to behave in</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.409" end="02:02:26.170" style="s2">ethically dubious ways so yet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.980" end="02:02:30.070" style="s2">just that&#39;s just a kind of living</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.170" end="02:02:32.020" style="s2">question for me is how do you have a</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.070" end="02:02:34.050" style="s2">conception of ethics that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.020" end="02:02:36.699" style="s2">of embodied in the live and entails</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.050" end="02:02:39.880" style="s2">ethical experience without falling prey</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.699" end="02:02:42.219" style="s2">to this kind of you know I can</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.880" end="02:02:45.790" style="s2">I am the the Bodhisattva bun can do no</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.219" end="02:02:47.679" style="s2">wrong type behavior that leads to</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.790" end="02:02:53.099" style="s2">monstrosity so anyway that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.679" end="02:02:53.099" style="s2">think though and I will pass it to Brent</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.520" end="02:03:04.210" style="s2">thanks my closing sentiment kind of</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.869" end="02:03:06.969" style="s2">builds on and it was coming up for me</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.210" end="02:03:09.940" style="s2">when Amy and John we&#39;re talking and and</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.969" end="02:03:12.099" style="s2">the Ryan a little bit and it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.940" end="02:03:14.110" style="s2">this idea that that hasn&#39;t come up in</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.099" end="02:03:18.010" style="s2">this conversation is conventional wisdom</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.110" end="02:03:20.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s typically a pejorative mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.010" end="02:03:21.579" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s an important thing to</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.079" end="02:03:23.730" style="s2">consider when we talk about wisdom</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.579" end="02:03:25.929" style="s2">because it&#39;s like a mask groupthink</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.730" end="02:03:28.300" style="s2">delusion potentially maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.929" end="02:03:29.949" style="s2">something harmless like you participate</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.300" end="02:03:32.050" style="s2">in some social construction like</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.949" end="02:03:34.710" style="s2">Christmas and that&#39;s the conventional</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.050" end="02:03:40.690" style="s2">wisdom but maybe it&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.710" end="02:03:42.730" style="s2">Imperial or militant right so that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.690" end="02:03:45.519" style="s2">this is a more sociological question and</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.730" end="02:03:47.999" style="s2">it relates to things kind of</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.519" end="02:03:50.320" style="s2">outside the domain of psychology</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.999" end="02:03:53.289" style="s2">somewhat so I think we should keep those</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.320" end="02:03:55.900" style="s2">things in mind as we build our</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.289" end="02:03:59.619" style="s2">individual and collective sense making I</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.900" end="02:04:03.130" style="s2">know I want to quickly close with an</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.619" end="02:04:05.440" style="s2">anecdote which it&#39;s it&#39;s personal to me</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.130" end="02:04:08.769" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s really helps give</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.440" end="02:04:12.039" style="s2">context to this conversation when I was</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.769" end="02:04:15.099" style="s2">a kid I went to my dad and said like I</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.039" end="02:04:16.599" style="s2">was into Socrates and learning about</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.099" end="02:04:19.599" style="s2">Socrates and I was kind of just blown</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.599" end="02:04:22.510" style="s2">away by the fact that Socrates was</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.599" end="02:04:24.789" style="s2">famous for his ignorance this was kind</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.510" end="02:04:28.210" style="s2">of a point of pride Socratic ignorance</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.789" end="02:04:31.539" style="s2">and I said as explaining to my dad I</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.210" end="02:04:34.869" style="s2">said I mean Socrates was the wisest in</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.539" end="02:04:37.780" style="s2">the land because he knew nothing right</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.869" end="02:04:39.460" style="s2">isn&#39;t that amazing and my dad it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.780" end="02:04:41.349" style="s2">not a philosopher but without missing a</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.460" end="02:04:45.880" style="s2">beat he turned to me and he said oh yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.349" end="02:04:49.179" style="s2">well I know even less so so the takeaway</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.880" end="02:04:51.760" style="s2">there is you know just this this</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.179" end="02:04:53.739" style="s2">humility before knowledge and and you</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.760" end="02:04:55.749" style="s2">can help you we all should have it in</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.739" end="02:04:57.820" style="s2">the basic sense that Socrates did but</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.749" end="02:05:02.099" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not enough you have to go</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.820" end="02:05:08.679" style="s2">further and just be a complete oblivious</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.099" end="02:05:35.739" style="s2">sponge for knowledge I&#39;ll pass it on to</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.679" end="02:05:55.690" style="s2">Antoine I do wonder because you know</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.739" end="02:05:57.639" style="s2">Jennifers I might have maybe it&#39;s as I</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.690" end="02:05:58.460" style="s2">think it is maybe I think it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.639" end="02:06:01.600" style="s2">it is because</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.460" end="02:06:09.170" style="s2">is insufficiently</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.600" end="02:06:12.380" style="s2">optimized to read people so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.170" end="02:06:14.930" style="s2">of the many questions that ones I guess</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.380" end="02:06:18.470" style="s2">for myself it&#39;s like to what degree</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.930" end="02:06:38.000" style="s2">exactly is that behavior actually</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.470" end="02:06:44.480" style="s2">beneficial so let&#39;s go hi so I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.000" end="02:06:48.860" style="s2">to focus more on your longing part of</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.480" end="02:06:52.520" style="s2">wisdom like on this journey of wisdom</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.860" end="02:06:55.940" style="s2">being more wise things has to shift</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.520" end="02:07:01.100" style="s2">I mean supposed to shift spiritually</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.940" end="02:07:04.310" style="s2">physically biologically and how do we</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.100" end="02:07:10.820" style="s2">get to play with belonging when things</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.310" end="02:07:21.250" style="s2">are shifting with the result of a good</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.820" end="02:07:28.360" style="s2">wisdom journey and this was my question</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.250" end="02:07:28.360" style="s2">and I I think I&#39;ll pass it to Elliot</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.480" end="02:07:33.950" style="s2">thanks well I&#39;m grateful to have found</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.460" end="02:07:37.220" style="s2">this space especially because I tend to</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.950" end="02:07:39.670" style="s2">be kind of cynical or pessimistic when</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.220" end="02:07:41.870" style="s2">it comes to the the prospect of</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.670" end="02:07:43.870" style="s2">collectively making sense of the world</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.870" end="02:07:48.230" style="s2">and wisdom seems to be something that</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.870" end="02:07:53.720" style="s2">somehow were not able at least to get on</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.230" end="02:07:57.730" style="s2">the same page about in general and so so</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.720" end="02:08:01.040" style="s2">one of the questions that this kind of</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.730" end="02:08:02.750" style="s2">re-ignited for me is the question of how</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.040" end="02:08:08.870" style="s2">scalable is this approach that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.750" end="02:08:11.380" style="s2">here to enact this evening and and how</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.870" end="02:08:13.360" style="s2">how much of a</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.380" end="02:08:16.119" style="s2">is it a niche thing is it something that</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.360" end="02:08:19.329" style="s2">the idea of reflecting on the nature of</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.119" end="02:08:21.010" style="s2">wisdom and trying to live that what&#39;s</p>
