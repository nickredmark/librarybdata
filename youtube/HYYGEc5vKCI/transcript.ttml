<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">networks uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">still relationships networks like from</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">last time but really talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">change and hopefully have maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">more time for for dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">last time i went fairly long talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">about a lot of stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">i have a slightly shorter slide deck</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">this time so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">i&#39;ll networks and intelligence building</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">on last time um</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll look at what what&#39;s called process</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">metaphysics and just spend a little time</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">uh and then build building on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">relational process metaphysics and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">networked relational process metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">so a lot of the word metaphysics uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">in there please don&#39;t be alarmed by that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">um more accessible than this slide may</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">initially make it look</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">so again last time i took i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">thinking about different ways of looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">at relationships just to recap</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">we generally in the vernacular think</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">about relationships as</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">the the connecting thing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">between two selves or two bodies or two</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">objects</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">we can say the sun and the moon are or</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">the sun of the earth our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">we can say that um all of us here on</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">this call on in the session are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">relationship to each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s always viewed in sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">node link format we have nodes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">they&#39;re connected by links</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">um but the alternative view to look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">that is if we make the links themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">the first class thing and the nodes are</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">actually not so much concrete structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">or atoms</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">but the links and the interactions are</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:56.159" style="s2">the important things the binding energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">if you will</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">and when those come together and cohere</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">in a place or in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">region abstract or concrete um</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what creates then a thing so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">things substances</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">objects they are they are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">secondary and somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">a lot of the things are actually created</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">by the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">from the outside world and i also talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">about the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">um the sense of self and the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">agency freedom</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">what have you that sense of self and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">emerges when we have um an inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">sort of society of relationships pushing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">against an outer society</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">of relational pressures um and so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">is this is a way to think of the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">from a relational metaphysics if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">will as opposed to an atomic node</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">nodes with links kind of metaphysics now</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">um i wanted i wanted to this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">little story i saw</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">um come across on reddit which was this</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">little cat</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">that was riding the public buses um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">and he would uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">take like round trips and and the driver</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">would give him food he would sit on</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">passengers laps</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">uh and the driver would let him off i</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">had to stop</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">and so i so the thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">besides this being a very heartwarming</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">adorable little story</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">the thought experiment is what is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">like to be this cat</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">remember you&#39;re a cat you don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">busses work they&#39;re just really really</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">big cats</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">that squish other cats right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">know what people are they&#39;re two legged</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">giant things</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">as far as you know there&#39;s cats they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">just inedible</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">and then and they&#39;re not mice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">they&#39;re not you know bugs i mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not grass they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have a model of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">anything in your world if just</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">try to reduce yourself down to a cat</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">brain you&#39;re this cat</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">and you step onto a bus the driver feeds</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">you i mean you don&#39;t know that as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">driver that has anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">where the bus goes just</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">go on this bus you get fed you sit on</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">people&#39;s laps you get petted</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">no one eats you no one beats you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">um at some point you feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">some attention on you and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">and the doors open and you get off and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">it&#39;s right where you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">um really i would encourage you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">really try this i mean all of us we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">we&#39;re conscious and we think about human</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">consciousness all the time i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">but try to think about what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">be a cat</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">in this complex world of buses and um uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">you know metropolitan transport and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">you&#39;re walking on this bus like a boss</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">and you&#39;re getting off this</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">bus like a boss uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">this is the reason i i prompt this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">there is an intrinsic amount of trust</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">that exists between this cat</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">and this organism of the bus right it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">gets eaten it feels like it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">eaten by a bus and then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">regurgitated by a bus</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">and there are other you know agents</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">inside the bus that are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">harmless</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">my takeaway on this is that trust</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">is the generative kernel that allows for</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">relationships to arise and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">um in abundant relationships with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">not dependent relationships so much but</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">but in this case it&#39;s more of a i guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat of a dependent</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">but at some point the cat must have</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">crossed a bridge of trust like indiana</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">jones right um</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">and he walks across that invisible</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">bridge spoiler alert by the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">but um you know there&#39;s there is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">kernel of trust that begins</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">the possibility of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">and if it doesn&#39;t get violated if it</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">gets validated reciprocated</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">then a relationship can arise and and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">i think sort of just kind of taking a</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">swag at this i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">that this is true of essentially all</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">really solid</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">relationships is that there must be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">colonel</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">or a series of kernels or a continuation</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">of trust that exists and trust</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">is open and vulnerable this cat it could</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">go into a bus and who knows</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">as soon as that door closes ten pit</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:48.960" style="s2">bulls to come rushing out the back and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">have a pit bull and they&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">that violent but you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">the point is that that cat is getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">eaten by a bus</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s trusting that it&#39;s not gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">right it trusts and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">every time the driver lets it off at its</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">stop it</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">it validates right there&#39;s a validation</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">there and and i&#39;m not going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">the other question which is a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">question of what is it like to be this</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">driver why does that human being driver</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">do this to the cat that&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">different question</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">but at least what it&#39;s like to be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">cat um</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.160" style="s2">the other thing is that this of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">works across species we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.160" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">it in the concept of human relationships</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">but clearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">with our pets with animals that we love</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">and take care of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">this is a thing right it also it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">have to be animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">we tend to gardens now the gardens can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">really reciprocate much to us because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">they move at a different</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">they have a different metabolic pace</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">than we do so do forests and so do the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">rivers and so does all of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">but there is still um i mean when we go</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">to when we go to taking care of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">that have longer time span and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">dynamics than ourselves now we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">cat</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">right so this is the thing to think</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">we&#39;re all cats on buses to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if we&#39;re gonna get eaten</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">and whatever that door opens and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">back magically at the doorstep of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">we feel blessed we feel validated right</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">the trust the trustal connection worked</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">so the other thing is that when we think</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">about the world purely from a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">transactional perspective and from an</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">atomized interaction perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">transactions</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">trust is always the residual the residue</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">the remainder</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s just chopped off and forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">about it is the externality</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">in the social binding that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">ignored and this is the issue i have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">when i meet people who are um and i do</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">have friends who are like hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">objectivists and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">hardcore like just individuals atomized</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">sovereign interacting with individuals</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">we have no need to trust it&#39;s trustless</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">we have this wonderful blockchain thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">totally trustless and we can facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">all these interactions and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">actually trustless isn&#39;t the point the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">point is to facilitate trust that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">where actually the generative value</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">and so even in business and i&#39;m i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">business person myself right i&#39;m a ceo</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">a founder and entrepreneur and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">business my my experience has been that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">the the i the con the word transactional</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">is a dirty word</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">right when i&#39;m talking to somebody if</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">i&#39;m talking to one of my uh executives</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">vetting a candidate and and she says to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">well yeah you know they&#39;re experienced</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">but they&#39;re kind of transactional</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad word that candy&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">get hired</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">right so the idea in business</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s all transactions is actually</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">in business business the way i always</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">talk about business is</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">transactions in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s the big difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">in business</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">and like when that&#39;s why you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">business with friends so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">because friends we don&#39;t have a ledger</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">our transactions if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">transact let&#39;s say we all go in on a ski</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">trip somewhere or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">well we have a ledger we know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">the domain and the scope of activity</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to have a transactional</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">accounting</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:53.279" style="s2">but everything else we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">address on that and if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">look at friends who have drama i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">you all have friends that have drama</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">look at it through this lens and i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">what you&#39;ll see is that oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">the cause of drama is when people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">differing expectations</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">about transaction who&#39;s keeping it</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">ledger right what was relational what</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">was give and take</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">and if and you can&#39;t live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">humans cannot form a socialization</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">without some give and take right so this</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">again starting with the cat going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">relational</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">and really thinking about um the way we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">networks and socializations that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">generative</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">is when we can trust with each other in</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">that relationship we can use trust to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">these generative connections and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">are not transactional all those</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">transactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">can be conducted through them can flow</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">to them and be facilitated by them</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">they certainly can scale transactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">another great example of this is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">banking in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">um uh in the middle east there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">essentially a trust-based</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">peer-to-peer financial settlement and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">credit system that they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">that is not like the sort of global you</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">know like um</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">you know the way would you swipe a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">credit card to foreign country there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">global series of banks and settlement</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">and everything talks over high-speed</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that we do it kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">the in the in the western world with</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">credit cards</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">but in the middle east um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">there&#39;s essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">highly federated and decentralized um</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">credit facility across countries and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">cities</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">and um it all works on a basis of trust</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">between all these different people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">an ovation network</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:21.120" style="s2">the word novation is not used very much</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:22.959" style="s2">in the vernacular it&#39;s kind of a term of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.120" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">art but it is uh it is the correct term</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.959" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">here they proxy trust they delegate</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">trust up to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">pure social network of lender clear</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">so um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">so completely switching gears um</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">ship of theseus how many people here are</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">familiar with the paradox of the ship of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">theseus</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">a few people um so</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll walk through for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">not familiar it&#39;s a paradox that says</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">this actually comes from the greek</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">because you know uh there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">um uh a story there from from plutarch</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">basically that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">that said that basically um they have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">ship and every time some of the wood got</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">rotted or</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">decayed or got damaged they would</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">replace that piece of wood</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">and they put new stronger timbers in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">this place right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">and so over time essentially every</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">single piece of wood on the ship had</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">been replaced</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">and the question is is it the same ship</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">right is the same ship and of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">because philosophers have too much to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">eat</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">and too much time they argue back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">forth internally about this paradox</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">um and uh and it&#39;s a fun one it&#39;s a fun</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">one to try with kids it&#39;s a phone to try</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">just in you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">at a cocktail party um it&#39;s a great way</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">to plumb the depth of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.440" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">various people around you because it</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">does strike</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">us as quite a paradox i mean we as</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">people um</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">our atoms are being replaced all the</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">right we&#39;re decaying we&#39;re sloughing off</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">we have a static world of objects</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">but kind of with the relational thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">from last time and i talked about</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">between people but you can take it down</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">right if we see the entire world</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">this way but if we think about it in</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">in this way then the ship of theseus</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.000" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">hologram if you have like a visa credit</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">card you see a little hologram printed</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.519" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">you&#39;ve gotten you know maybe stickers uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">maybe even a science museum and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">looked</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">and the the thing about a hologram</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s different than a photograph of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">course is</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:35.360" style="s2">if i take a photograph that captures one</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">perspective if i turn the photograph</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">sideways i mean i don&#39;t see a different</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">of the thing inside the photograph now</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">with our tablets nowadays and our</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">smartphones</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:46.399" style="s2">we get augmented reality things that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">really cool right i can sort of turn the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.399" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">thing around it actually changes the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">perspective of the camera</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:53.759" style="s2">in the virtual space but um</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">but but of course static pictures don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.759" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">do that take a picture i print it out i</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">look at the picture different angles</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the same point of view</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">in the picture itself holograms are not</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">this way holograms</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">when you bounce light on them they</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">project a light field</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">such that if you move your head</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">around that light field you actually see</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">different perspectives so</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:14.720" style="s2">what&#39;s shown here on the left is this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">the hologram of a mouse</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.720" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">and when you look from different</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">directions at the projection of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">hologram</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">you see different views on the mouse as</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">if there was a real virtual mouse back</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">now if you i don&#39;t know how many of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">have then actually gone and looked at</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">what a hologram actually looks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">you know because they bounce laser light</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">off of the hologram</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">itself and it produces this light field</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">you look at the actual hologram looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">just a bunch of overlapping like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look like anything i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">look at you&#39;re like what is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">bunch of like it almost looks like noise</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">but what it is is extremely extremely</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">tiny</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">um imprints of the light field itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">the diffraction of the light field</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">it captures it and then when you when</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">you shine</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.279" end="00:17:01.440" style="s2">a coherent light on that light field</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">again it reconstitutes</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.440" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">so it&#39;s like taking a slice of the light</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">field and without getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">physics of optics and all these other</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">um suffice to say that uh when you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">come across the word holographic</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">uh in in maybe um</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">in technical literature when they or in</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">the idea of a hologram is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">capturing multiple points of view</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">and something about like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">three-dimensional aspect of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">of the light field we&#39;re capturing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">and projecting it in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">this this little miniature thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">the idea of the smaller thing captures</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">a lot of the structure and detail and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">multiple perspectiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">of this larger reality holography right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">hologram</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">um and so likewise here uh i started</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">drawing this thing i bring up the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">holograms because it reminded me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">of what an actual hologram looks like</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">like diffraction rings all like tied</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">into each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">so if we look at the world not as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">static world of objects</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">but as these overlapping worlds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">um then you you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">uh the the way i talk about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">when when we when we think about um</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">the world is not consisting of of atomic</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">um substance but we see everything as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">continuum</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">in energy in space right uh if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">really go and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">mentioned this last time in quantum</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">mechanics if you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">um quantum mechanical fundamentals of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">atoms</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not really a solid atom thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s quantum mechanical wave</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">that because of measurement because of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">interaction because whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">they they form a spatially localized</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">but otherwise you model it uh in</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">in as a continuum field</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">if you think about the world as</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">continuum field like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">then um then you realize that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">things are not bounded so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">the world as</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">atoms you tend to think of them as being</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">bounded in space</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">but here&#39;s the other thing you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">think of them as static and bounded</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">in time when you think about the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">these waves you intuitively don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">of a wave as frozen</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s weird to think of a wave like if</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">you drop a rock in a pond</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">and the waves are rippling and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">the waves as being stopped</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">seems super unnatural it is natural for</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">us to think of wave phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">as being evolving waves themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">just wave fronts that are evolving if</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">you will right</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">so when we go to a wave or continuum a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">medium view of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">a medium based way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">it leads us naturally to what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">process metaphysics or process</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">and um and the idea here is that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">different point of view</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">than say the aristotelian view of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">world which says the world consists of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">objects</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">objects of fundamental substances we now</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">know that there&#39;s 118 or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">types of atoms that we found um and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">atoms are consisting of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">fundamental particles and it&#39;s like all</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s all a world of static</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">construction process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">turns us completely around and says</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">actually everything is changing</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">all the time there&#39;s actually nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">that is just is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">everything is changing all the time um</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">and our only ability to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">static objects is because we insist on</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">tracing causal narratives through the</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">so we say well here&#39;s a thing and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">this thing has this dynamicness to it it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">knocks on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">and that thing does these things and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">need and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">um intentional trace of causality</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">through all these overlapping wavefronts</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">of energy and possibility</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">that need for that narrative is actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">what creates metaphysical reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">right and and and this is again just</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">super this is a a younger me</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">listening to myself pontificating like</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">this would say hold up peter if i were</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">to throw a brick at your face there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">process velocity involved there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">hard substance there in that brick</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">right come on stop what crack are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">smoking</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">and and it&#39;s true that a brick falling</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">on my toe or hitting my face would hurt</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">and there is substance there um uh but</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">you know pain as the buddhists say pain</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">is just attachment right</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">um if i&#39;m not attached to my face having</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">a a piece like this no actually that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">joke um the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">the point is that the if you really get</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">into the details of what happens at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">physical level in the physics</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">you see that there&#39;s a lot of truth to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">this even in the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">formulations</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">when you zoom out and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">dynamics of human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s also a lot of truth in this all</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">of how many of you have used the word</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">france in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">probably all of you at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">your life have used the word france but</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">there is no france is there</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">right which france are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">historically through time if you talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">about france right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">the border of france and i&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">boundary in just a second but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">just talking about the space within</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">france you&#39;re also probably referring to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">french culture which is a timeless thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">emerging from all the french people</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">french people living in</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">france and all the expats you have all</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">of these other things that have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">franceness to them</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">now none of us i think would deny that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">france exists and yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">as soon as you ask that question you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">like well but what does it mean for it</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">to exist it&#39;s not a brick</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">right um and as soon as we start</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">creating these hard boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">in our metaphysics like well a brick is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">real but france isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">uh you know an atom is real but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">you know christianity isn&#39;t when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">start approaching the world with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">metaphysical frame</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">you end up with all sorts of faux</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">paradoxes like the ship of theseus</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">that only exists because your frame is</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">broken not because the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">uh has any weirdness to it right</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">everyone is everyone in france</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">knows what france means and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">lives in france as if they live in</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">france not as if they&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">delusional</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">about living in france so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">going to alternative metaphysics like</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">is to create a greater synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">phenomenon and relational things</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">so um and even an atom just to make just</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">to kind of do a little more like science</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">hour here</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know how many of you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">this but uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">we we&#39;ve all learned in school there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">the proton and the neutron and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:06.720" style="s2">in the nucleus of the atom</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s a bunch of electrons you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.720" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">know either you might have drawn the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">picture of the orbitals but really</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of these clouds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">electrons</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">right not a difficult concept certainly</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">physics chemistry engineering student at</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">any university in the world would agree</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">with this assessment of the atom</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">however proton and neutron</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">and electron well they were discovered</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">different times</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">and they have vastly different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">properties to them to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">you almost question their metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">weight electrons well do they really</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">exist i don&#39;t know it&#39;s like because</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a wave there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">a probability wave we can&#39;t even talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">about where this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">until you hit it with something else and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">then it becomes localized depending on</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">what you&#39;re hitting it with and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:49.919" style="s2">what other thing in the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">france doesn&#39;t vary depending on which</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">angle i come at france from right</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t like there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">things that are actually like france is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">more real than electrons</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">to some extent and then you look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.080" style="s2">protons and neutrons well protons okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">the protons of mass and charge and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.080" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">they&#39;re quite heavy this were all</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">you know the most of the mass neutrons</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">are also massive just like protons that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">have no charge they&#39;re intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">neutral</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">protons how long does a proton last</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">can a proton be destroyed or created</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">well in a super in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">in a super collider you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">destroy them and you know knock them</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">into each other and get little bits out</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">but in general a proton will stay around</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">for infinite number of like infinity</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">ever forever</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">naturally protons just kind of are</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">always there neutrons</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">which are also the same masses protons</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">that are electrically neutral</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">they have a half-life of 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">they remember tell you that in high</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">school neutrons</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">decay naturally in the space of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">not even a television sitcom episode so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">here&#39;s something that lasts for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">lifetime of the universe here&#39;s some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">the decays instantly and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">something else that floats around the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">bubble of probabilities until we</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">probe it with another bubble of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">probabilities and that is the building</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">blocks of matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">so when we talk about metaphysics as</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">being all like oh it&#39;s too hand wavy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">of course you look at worlds in many</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">different ways but what does it mean</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s actually kind of left up it&#39;s kind</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not nearly as solid as you might</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">another uh just to really put a you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">not to find a point on it</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">but uh talk about the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">measure of electrons and does france</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">this is a picture of the coastline of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">california it&#39;s not on fire</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">but it is the coastline of california</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">and here&#39;s a really fun question again</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">another great cocktail sort of party</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">dinner dinner table sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">thing how long is the coast of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">california</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">this is a question of physics this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">question of reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">right this is not peter going off on</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">weird metaphysics this is a very like we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">well to the extent that we acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.159" style="s2">there exists a thing as california</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">and we bound it and we to think not to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.159" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">the extent that we acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">there&#39;s water and there&#39;s liquid in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">solid state</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">and where in the the sand you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">constitutes the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">there is a length of coastline surely</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">there exists a coastline of california</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">that does exist right at some point</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">you&#39;re in the ocean at some point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">and surely it has the length i can</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">measure anything in the world why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">i measure the length of the coastline of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">california</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">but here&#39;s the here&#39;s the other this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">this is another fun ship of theseus</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">thing right</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">the length of the coast of california</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">depends on the scale at which you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">measure it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">if i measure the coast of california</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">with a yardstick</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">i get a different answer than if i</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">measure it counting</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">every millimeter of jaggy if i zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">to an aerial view and i&#39;m measuring it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">by kilometers</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">i get a different measure none of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">answers are correct</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">and yet none of them are wrong either</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">right what this is highlighting is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">the very concept</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s you know what&#39;s the issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">here i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">how many of you have i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">many of you thought about this but there</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">is there&#39;s actually not an issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">here except for our metaphysics and our</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">sort of philosophy of science right</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">the california does not have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">its coastline does not have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">the ocean is not confused about this the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">sands are not confused</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">what&#39;s confused is that the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">length is not a purely objective measure</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">length itself is actually a projection</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">of subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">how do we want to measure how do we want</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">to perceive it that gives us a readout</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">that readout is contextualized by how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">measured it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">as long as we carry that context forward</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">we can do a lot of interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">useful things</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">if we lose that context and say nope</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">there is this objective thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">the length of california</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">there is objective truth here is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">length of california i don&#39;t why are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">talking about yardsticks and metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">there is of course meta a california</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">with a coast and it has a length</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">done if you take that kind of view of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">the world you&#39;re just going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">confused by paradoxes left and right</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">because again to whitehead&#39;s point here</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">causality causal narratives all of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">ways that we look at objects in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">world and their relationships to each</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">other if we view them as static</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">and not as dynamic things that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">becoming if we view them</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">as as atomic things substances that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">bounce</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">against each other and not as</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">and and reality and dynamics then</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">we have paradoxes all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">because because it&#39;s our own measuring</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">tools our</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">mental models that create the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">just like the measuring stick here</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:30.960" style="s2">creates the paradox so to make this more</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">visual</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.960" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">an atomic or spatial view really talks</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">about beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">in fact we use that term beings it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">being it&#39;s an object it&#39;s a thing</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">learn about objects you learn about</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">their emotions you learn about energy</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">and dynamic in fact we call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">kinematics which is the motion of</p>

<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">and and that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">physicists do those are the actual terms</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">we use</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">so in physics we&#39;re based on uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">you know physics in the modern era is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">based on a metaphysics of static things</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">that do have dynamics to them but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">dynamic-ness is always</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">about certain capturable properties of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">the static thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">the process view is a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">metaphysics and it is actually more</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">resonant with like the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">mechanical view of the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">and maybe future physics to come will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">based on process metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">so that we can always talk about uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">uh these four-dimensional flows in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a term for this called</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">four-dimensionalism</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">and this whole body of thought which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">that we we should stop looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">the static things that evolve in time</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">and actually look at everything as</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">processes that interact and create</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">coherent zones in space and in time</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">um and this this framing of being or</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">um is uh is a term used by uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">you know i stole it from ilya</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">priyogine&#39;s uh the title of his book</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">um he is a nobel prize winner very very</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">very very smart person and when you look</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">at complexity and chaos when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">when you see physicists that study</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">things like um</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">you know uh laminar flows non-linearity</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">or spin glasses metastable things um</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">people study that kind of stuff they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">right they&#39;re they&#39;re basically probing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">through the holes of the current</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">metaphysics the original metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">and they&#39;re always having to look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">things from kind of this process and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">dynamical view</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">so all that being said if we can layer</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:41.840" style="s2">in the stuff that i was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.840" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">um in the very first session about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">where we view individuals as having a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">physical and biological social</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">intellectual aspect</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">if you don&#39;t view if you don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">that layer cake as a static layer cake</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">but as overlapping flows i mean each one</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">existing on top of the other i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.519" style="s2">actually disjoint like this i drew them</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">this way but but recognize this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">one is higher frequencies on top of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">lower frequencies on top of even lower</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">frequencies but it&#39;s all one body of</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">water it&#39;s all you you&#39;re a bag of water</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">so if you add the metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">to this kind of process metaphysics view</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">you realize oh oh i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">multiple different kinds of overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">dynamics evolving in time</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">and each part of the self has a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">different rate of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">each part of the self as it evolves in</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">time interfaces with the other parts and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">and maybe resonates with it or jostles</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">against it um</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">which is you know i love the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">terms i love from stoic practice about</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">the integral self right mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">the wholeness of being the embodied self</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">is is essentially another way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">make sure your intellectual part is in</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">resonance with your social part</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">is in resonance with your biological and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:54.799" style="s2">physical all of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">moves together you gotta have good diet</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.799" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">good exercise good rest</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">uh learn how to how to trust and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">love authentically right and then um</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">harness your attention be mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">your attention all these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">is making sure that one part of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">ways don&#39;t get don&#39;t start bubbling so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">fast</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">it evaporates and you lose mass and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">lose coherence with the rest of the you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">because all of you is becoming in time</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">here&#39;s the other thing uh i i lightly</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">touched on this before</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">when i said that uh in a process</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">metaphysics we view everything as flows</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">of constant becoming</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">and static objects or any kind of static</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">approach towards if we approach</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">something from a static perspective</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">we&#39;re bounding it in time and space okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">but we we we can form</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">relationships with each other i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">are not me</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">and even if we hold hands and touch even</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">if we&#39;re in an embrace</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">we&#39;re still two distinct objects right i</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">mean at a at a very visceral and a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">accessible intuitive level that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">be the case</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">but when we</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">look at so there&#39;s a relationship still</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">somewhat between two distinct objects</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">but if we think about the self</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">as not just localized in space but</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">localized in time</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">then we can talk about our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">to our future</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">and our relationship to our past and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">do this anyway i mean you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">go through metaphysics to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">that people talk about their past and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">their futures right that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">but if you think about it this way and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">you decompose or deconstruct a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">bit and look at the different</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">frequencies of being and frequencies and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">rates of change of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">of the different layers of yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">can see that you relate to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">different aspects of yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">different ways so</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">in the past we have memory we have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">memory of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">we have even subconscious memory and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">subconscious trauma right you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">together the freudian stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">and and then we also have a future</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">and we interface not just with our own</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">past selves and futures but with each</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">and with different aspects of each</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">other&#39;s if i&#39;m only interested</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">in someone&#39;s biological future that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">like literally</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">what we mean when we say something is</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">objectifying and it&#39;s ugly</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">right no no no one no one wants to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">objectified</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">and what is objectified means it means</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting reduced from this</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">of this of multiple overlapping evolving</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">becomings</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">into a single aspect you you get you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">bottle into a single aspect</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">you&#39;re objectified and then probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">transacted with</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">as an object so when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:34.880" style="s2">um talk about interacting with our past</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">selves and our future selves</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">these are all different lanes or</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">different um aspects we can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:43.920" style="s2">relating to ourselves in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">coaching a lot of therapeutic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.920" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">therapy sort of work is in helping</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">get a current set of things in resonance</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">with each other you know if they&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">if they&#39;re broken if they&#39;re hurt uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">broken is a sorry kind of a derogatory</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">term but</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">um if people are feeling a lot of pain</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">and caring a lot of trauma then parts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">them are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">other parts are trying to get forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">and none of it&#39;s in resonance</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">if you can get in resonance by showing</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">that they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">break with the past a little bit or they</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">can understand the past in context</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re not stuck in the past they</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">don&#39;t have to carry it forward every</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a very um standard practice in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">in in therapy and coaching right</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">so this idea of seeing yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">multi-layered thing evolving in time</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">relating to yourself in this way and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">relating to others in this way</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">then leads to the topic of love</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">and i think my my sort of working</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">of love is when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">are taking a vested interest we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">actively putting energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">into helping some other entity</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">or collection of process flows</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">reach their future full integral</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">and we put energy into that we trust</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">that that energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">will well i mean we don&#39;t even need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">trust the recip reciprocity of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">but we&#39;re putting it into it not because</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">of a reflection we get out of it or</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">something we transact out of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">but because uh we&#39;re just putting energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">into this other system</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">so we&#39;re taking our energy and our</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">essence and putting it into some other</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">uh donating contributing helping the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">other system achieve resonance</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">and and maximal optionality as it</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">evolves</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">forward in time and then a mutual loving</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">relationship is of course when two</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">people or objects or</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">whatever zones of confluences of of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">of processes when they do that for each</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">other so</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">anyway that is process metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">a whole bunch of metaphysics probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:39.839" style="s2">more than you care for on a friday</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">um and now i will stop for questions</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">questions</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">of them if you want to uh</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">too and then we can we can go uh do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">someone did say</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll read this uh okay peter wayne is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">lovable</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">thank you we are all lovable but i</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">appreciate i appreciate you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">thank you very much so i i&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">the first question um</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">you mentioned something about normies</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">right and uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">like normies they&#39;re lovable too they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">lovable too</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">but like you know normies got a norm and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">then the norm right there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">you know the contrast process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:29.040" style="s2">like a static philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s sort of like an epistemic or</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.040" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">i should say metaphysical violence like</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">subtly when you interact with someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">who is like projecting a static</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">philosophy on you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:41.920" style="s2">tactical</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">mental models in order to ground</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.920" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">yourself in a process philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:48.160" style="s2">encourage it in others</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">and i was returning to what you said</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">about trust and love</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">um like there&#39;s something that i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">terming as the hemingway heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">like ernest hemingway said if you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">to find out if someone&#39;s trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">trust them</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">um right and it relates to the pygmalion</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">i think effect where if you just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">uh view someone in a certain light it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">influences them to become that way</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious if you have any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">on that and if you have any tactical</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">mental models in order to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">you know deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">yes so let me walk backwards right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">the last thing you said was the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">the the pygmalion um thing uh so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">interesting right because this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">related to the uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">when i talked about celebrity culture um</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">and the the fact that our</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">uh current media systems or or</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">communication technologies created</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">the concept of celebrity and even the um</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">the uh the song video killed the radio</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">star right by adding a video aspect</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">to media we removed the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">primality and the primacy of sound and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">made it all about image and aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:54.079" style="s2">so um we people do</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">deeply understand or they&#39;ve perceived</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.079" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">some of these phenomena they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">understand it but they</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">perceive some of these things um so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">but that thing about um the pygmalion</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">thing um</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">let me see the right way to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">this okay so when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">look at this picture here um back to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">as the is like he can never get away</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">from being urkel so this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">thing that that pigment</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">how we look at things now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">if we don&#39;t ever interact with something</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">we just perceive it and that&#39;s just our</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">perception and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">our subjectivity that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no impact on that thing or</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">person or whatever at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">but if we all socialize with each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">and we create in the social field an</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">understanding of what that avatar is or</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">that explanation is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">now we&#39;re doing a thing to that person</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">right even if we actually ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">don&#39;t directly talk to that person</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:26.319" style="s2">so there&#39;s kind of like social media has</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">created this in just you know uh all</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.319" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">over the place it&#39;s really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">um so the the youtuber generation will</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">figure this out at some point but but</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">this is the doom that&#39;s coming to them</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">um but when it comes to tactically</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">addressing</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">people with um uh who are stuck in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">static</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">metaphysics you can well you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">probe i mean depending how long you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">to interact with them uh if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">really sitting down for a long</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">conversation you can start with the ship</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">of theseus</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">and just get them uh confuse them</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:41:59.839" style="s2">because confusion at least is honest</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.839" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">what&#39;s true about a trump voter that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">solidly maga solidly like just</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">fu on trump uh is that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:10.319" style="s2">confused at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not confused at all they know</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">for damn sure exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">uh why he is great for america and why</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">you hate america if you don&#39;t vote for</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">him right</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:20.079" style="s2">so when you talk to people if you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">get them into that liminal moment with</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.079" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s great so take these two tools</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">take the coast of california</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">um ask them to measure the california</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">coast of california ask them if the ship</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">of theseus is still the ship of theseus</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">and and if they say well that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">that&#39;s just a bunch of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">nonsense then i would say try to on your</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">feet</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">adapt that to something that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.359" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">accessible to them because</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">the great thing about well what i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">the correct metaphysics here is with</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">process metaphysics the great thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.800" style="s2">it&#39;s accessible everything in the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">everything in the world has this</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">character to it if you look at it across</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">the right time scales and sample it with</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:58.800" style="s2">the right frequency</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">so um the tree in the backyard</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.800" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">right um everything you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">and use the starting point to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">process metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">um and and to get them the goal</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">is to use these things confuse them and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">get them thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">how things change how they themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">process change</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">and isn&#39;t it the case that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">always changing</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">because most of the time when people use</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">subject or static metaphysics as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">defensive mechanism in particular um</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s to defend it&#39;s to defend a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s always to defend a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">worldview defend a way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">um it usually there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">conservatism and entrenchment</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">i feel like um as opposed to a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">zen</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:45.280" style="s2">aikido master kind of like flowing with</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">the things as they change</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.280" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">so anyway i would encourage i would</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">encourage that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">does that actually answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">are those is that helpful yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:55.119" style="s2">it reminds me of vent cat&#39;s grey-pilling</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">term um</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.119" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">like the idea of giving people great</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">pills to get them in that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">state um and someone in the chat says</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">that could be uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">anxiety invoking and uh i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a way you can do it in a i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">a delightful way yeah yeah well i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">the coast of california is relatively</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">approachable because</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">uh and you know or something to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:16.319" style="s2">form think about</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">uh other kinds of things where our</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.319" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">measurement reveals and actually you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">uh the way to find something like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">is look for complexity</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">because humans naturally do not deal</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">with complexity we</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">always overlay complexity with</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">metaphysical or epistemic boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">wrap it up and say well here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">um um so anytime</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">you find or think of something as</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">complex not complicated a watch is</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">a cockroach is complex right um so</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">look not for complications because those</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">are decomposable into smaller bits that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">are all then static moving</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">with with very linear and rigid</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">dynamism but complex things there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">sloshiness to them it could be a block</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">of birds flying a murmuration of birds</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">all kind of swooping around look for</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">and and find something there that could</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">amuse and delight them</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">you know delight and confusion they</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">could go hand in hand</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">um so let&#39;s turn to the the questions uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">kyle you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">sorry i couldn&#39;t find my mute um so it</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">it i was kind of riffing on this in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">chat i&#39;m not sure if it makes sense but</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">you all can tell me if it does or</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve never made the connection before</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">that kind of the process versus static</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">mindset that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">uh fits into what carol dweck&#39;s done on</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.400" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">fixed versus growth mindsets kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">and and so i was thinking about back to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">the cat</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">um that there&#39;s there has to be some</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">individual level agency towards the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">choice of being in a trusting</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">yes and yes and and so that&#39;s the cat</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously cat but</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">mutual trust is at least dyadic if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">not more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">right right it is pebbles in a pond all</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">these overlapping waves right</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">you just drop two pebbles in but we live</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">in a world of at least seven half</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">billion really interesting pebbles</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">right so um yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">so the individual i guess what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">trying to get at is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">necessary and sufficient conditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">at the individual level for the choice</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">to engage in trust</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">so uh okay let me share my browser</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">screen with you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">um so i don&#39;t know how many people here</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">on the call are familiar with um</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">whitehead but this guy he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">who was trying to formalize the entire</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">of um of like analytic philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">mathematics and</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">in fact uh you know girl incompleteness</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">for those of you programmers probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">uh was was sort of a rejection of some</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">of the stuff he was working on but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">a very famous like</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">hardcore like philosopher nerd kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">guy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">and he his articulation of what is this</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">ultimate principle</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">believe it or not it&#39;s creativity</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">for him the ultimate abstract principle</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">of actual existence is creativity</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">and we ourselves our expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">aggregate creativity of the trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">atoms that comprise us</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">and billions of cells and our societies</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">and our cultures and our</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">and our groups and our families in our</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">are the expression of something</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">and nothing you might as well call it um</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">in a sense again the free will versus</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">determinism paradox</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">right also is a is a faux paradox</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s rooted in static</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">i got static objects i got causal laws</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">for them where the hell is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">determinism right you&#39;re just a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">static objects and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">if you turn around to process it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">well no the static object projection in</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">the envelope</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">is itself just a tool you use to help</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">to help your predictive theories along</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">but there&#39;s plenty of places where those</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">theories fall apart and you have to use</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">like statistical mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing deterministic about that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">at all so um</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">so if you can look through all of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s creativity and this ties to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">my first session about robert persig and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">metaphysical quality remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">static versus dynamic quality every</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">level of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">you can see there is a dynamism an</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">energy in them</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the thing that springs</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">the thing forward right the ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">if i go back to the diagram here for</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">those who were not here for that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">um session share</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s this guy the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">the ratchet right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">people&#39;s mindsets the conservative</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">mindset of the the the fixed mindset</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">dwight&#39;s formulation that&#39;s the two and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it provides friction from number</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">one rotating but also keeps from</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">slipping back</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">that&#39;s you know what my life coach calls</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">protection right you&#39;re trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">protect yourself from hurt from pain</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">chaos and degeneration but</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">something drives one what is the spring</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">coiled up</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">what is god&#39;s hand turning one forward</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">that isn&#39;t everything it&#39;s in every atom</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in every beetle it&#39;s in every human</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s in every state it&#39;s in france if</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">you believe france exists</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere there&#39;s a creative</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">energy in france for sure right</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">and so there is this there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">a universal cosmological principle</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">and i talked about this in that first</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">session as well that the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">is all about the action of two when that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">forward driving is is done when we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.800" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">if there ever is such a thing as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">closed system which there never is but</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">if we define a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">within the closed system things will</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">decay to energy things will slip back</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:53.359" style="s2">things will go backwards</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">and all the physics in equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.359" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">science is based on building theories</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">and models and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">analytical equations for that very</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">little of science and math</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">is obsessed with what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">there&#39;s energy when there&#39;s new and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">excessive free energy coming in</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">what happens and in all cases new things</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">right things grow things create new</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">structures um whether you&#39;re taking a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">cello bow on the side of a plate of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">metal with sand on it whether you just</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">put a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">random chemicals into a pot and put</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">under the sun for a few billion years</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">life happens and creativity blossoms</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">across the across every level</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">of the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">all right thank you kyle uh deef you had</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">a question</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been jumping different comments</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">here and there</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">but uh part of the way my my mind works</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">is try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">integrate multiple perspectives and try</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">to bring up the essence</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">your add-on of the creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">artistic views sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:50:59.680" style="s2">the artistic view to create to capture</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">the divine in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.680" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">most concise and precise language</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">or art art and then so one potential</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">limitation is that by</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">your medium of communication is very</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">static pictures</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">and words and mental models</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">isn&#39;t that a bit of a limitation to try</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">to encourage somebody else to have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">time scaling waveform of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">uh because western models is just linear</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">time so you&#39;re automatically</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">communicating by</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">fractionating time from that cause and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">effect instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">cyclical or a nested layer of time right</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">or superposition right yeah so language</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">and communication by</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">the metaphysics you wish you had</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.760" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">right so uh or maybe that wasn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">his quote but that&#39;s essentially my</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">variant on it</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:12.800" style="s2">um to be completely honest and i really</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">appreciate everyone&#39;s engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.800" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">questions here</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been thinking about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">for a while some of these things are go</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">back 20 years when i was an undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">in in college some of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">relatively new that i&#39;ve discovered in</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">as i&#39;ve gone deeper and deeper on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">medics um and in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">technological society</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">um but this is the first context where</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve actually sat down and tried to</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">elucidate</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">all you know paint a picture of many of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">these things for any kind of an audience</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t just like a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">buddies over a beer so um</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">so you know i think you&#39;re right i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">what would be great</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">is if i could assemble when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">murmuration</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">right it&#39;ll be a narrative over a video</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">showing actually a flock of birds</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">forming murmuration</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">right that we could actually have um</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">visual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">that show this and then when i talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">about overlapping versus distinct</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s um a lot of it for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">uh the model of communication</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">um is is sort of like music</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">is super positional music and taste are</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">the you know flavors and taste</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">music and taste are the two things that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">we directly</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">viscerally encounter every day that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">intuitively superpositional</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">everything else tends to be more</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">cartesian more distinct more</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">you know um sequential and linearized</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">and atomic</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">and so um it would be great</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">to have contrasts of those in a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:34.880" style="s2">accessible way to show people</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:36.480" style="s2">imagine if we had to sequentialize music</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.880" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t super positional</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.480" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">imagine you know like you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">tell a story around this not just</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">imagine but showing people and letting</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">them hear the sounds</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">i think that&#39;d be a very powerful way to</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">get this kind of thing to make this more</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">accessible</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">um to a larger audience i agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">deep this is definitely a limitation of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">the medium and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">uh but it&#39;s also kind of a an audience</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">that will bear with it right that will</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">that will tolerate the medium</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">and the limitations so but you&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">of it sounds like you&#39;re aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">limitation of the media man</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:04.960" style="s2">yes the best thing is we all get the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">other person and we walk through the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">woods and i point out things</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">that are illustrations of this principle</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">to show these to show the universality</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">of some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">right that would be the ideal thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">okay good deal</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">cool um we are approaching the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:28.319" style="s2">hour so maybe it&#39;d be prudent to wrap up</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see any uh see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.319" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">statements but i don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:34.160" style="s2">uh questions uh or i can&#39;t tease any out</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">um so peter do you have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.160" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">closing thoughts or you want to set us</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">up for</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:40.559" style="s2">next week um well i guess i would like</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">to get a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.559" end="00:54:44.640" style="s2">sense from people like uh if this was if</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">this was um</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.640" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">you know useful or if like this was like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">is it the right level of what people</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">want to hear or is this um</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:54.079" style="s2">a little too abstract or do you want</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">like more like what i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.079" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t know like do you want me to just</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">talk about mimetics i talk about x and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">and whatnot um next time i could talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:05.359" style="s2">uh oh shoot the model of communications</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">i mean maybe that&#39;s the right thing i</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.359" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">mean it would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not to talk about next time</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">if folks are down with that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">yeah um people are saying this has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">and my my preference when i when i</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">invite someone to the store is to talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">about something that really resonates</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:22.319" style="s2">and then there&#39;s like a there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:23.760" style="s2">bias filtering effect that people will</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.319" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">gravitate towards that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.760" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">to this session and i&#39;m particularly</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">really loving these sessions i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:31.839" style="s2">writing my journals about them</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">okay um and just you know the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.839" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">putting all these mental models and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">putting them beside each other just</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">creates all these rich connections</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:39.599" style="s2">and that alone despite whatever memetic</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">artifact gets produced from this that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.599" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">alone is such a rich process</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:44.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re so good at it so um yeah i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s a highlight of my week to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">to just actually sit down and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">some of these things that are near and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">dear to my</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.359" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">heart and to my mind um and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">let&#39;s see it up for next time</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">let&#39;s really go and talk memetics and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">talk about them starting with the model</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">of communications</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">talk about the music boxes and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:07.599" style="s2">sculptures and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">go from there beautiful</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">so much to the fourth and final session</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">of the mental model series same time uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">this week we&#39;ll talk about memetics</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:21.520" style="s2">um for upcoming events we have a few</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">today we have a collective presencing</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.520" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">which is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">intersubjective practice that you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">we get to practice this relationality</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.319" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">and then have a felt sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">contours of it</p>
