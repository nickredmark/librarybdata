<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">I think we decided to focus this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">conversation around Zach&#39;s most recent</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">essay yep called kovat 19 a war broke</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">out in heaven mm-hmm and I was really</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.180" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">happy to read this because it was so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">mythopoetic so mythological and because</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">I&#39;m a sucker for that kind of language</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">and I also thought it was quite brave</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">because nobody&#39;s writing like that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">make the very strong statement that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a war in heaven and using this</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">strong eschatological terminology is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">that am I saying that right and I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">thinking about why that was so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">and I was thinking about Leonard Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">and I was thinking about Bob Dylan and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">was thinking about how they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">singing about the end of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:10.189" style="s2">in some level like there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">flood that&#39;s got to come and and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.189" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a crack in everything and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">know things are get a slide in all</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">directions and all these sort of lines</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">from from popular music we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">into my mind which is very biblical in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:28.460" style="s2">some sense and that&#39;s probably one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">the reasons why I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.460" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">Zak&#39;s essay and it&#39;s also I think a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">reason why other people might be quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">critical of it because the people once</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">want a more rational explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">not the ER essay was was not not</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">rational or reasonable but so could we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">speak about that can we speak about why</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">you&#39;re using this kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:56.270" style="s2">language and why it&#39;s important and why</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">I think I think your essay seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.270" end="00:02:02.360" style="s2">making the rounds in other words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:02.360" style="s2">affecting people in one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.770" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">sure thank you I mean I I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:10.450" style="s2">actually surprised by the reception of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">the paper I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.450" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">very happy I didn&#39;t expect it to be as</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">as well received as it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:23.420" style="s2">because I mostly expected people to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">you know cautious or worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.420" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">mythopoetic angle but I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">trying to draw attention it as clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">as I could to the interior aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">the crisis too and to specifically have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">something to say that wasn&#39;t directly</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:53.900" style="s2">about the biology and the geopolitics</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">and all the dynamics that are within</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.900" end="00:03:04.300" style="s2">this and yeah and some of it was also</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:09.650" style="s2">just in my own experience returning to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.300" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">where I go for solace right like as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.650" end="00:03:14.570" style="s2">was looking out at the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">coming from like the spiritual crown you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.570" end="00:03:21.170" style="s2">know and just terrible a lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:25.190" style="s2">terrible like an insulting</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.170" end="00:03:29.500" style="s2">I think insulting and a retreat to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.190" end="00:03:31.910" style="s2">kind of relativistic pre tragic</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.500" end="00:03:34.610" style="s2">spiritual escapism</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.910" end="00:03:36.049" style="s2">so can you characterize that describe</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.610" end="00:03:37.549" style="s2">what is so so terrible and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.049" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">something about you know let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">spiritual reaction to well I mean again</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:48.019" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s so much in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.190" end="00:03:50.320" style="s2">religious landscape now right so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.019" end="00:03:54.140" style="s2">still have the grip traditions you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.320" end="00:03:55.430" style="s2">the church and and the Sangha and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.140" end="00:03:57.890" style="s2">these things would still exist from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.430" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">great traditions I&#39;m talking mostly</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.890" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">about the non-affiliated kind of human</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">potential movement New Age movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">crowd at least in America where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:16.100" style="s2">this strange confluence between</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:17.479" style="s2">post-modernism and Buddhism and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.100" end="00:04:19.729" style="s2">particular where you get this like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.479" end="00:04:22.340" style="s2">allegiance between the deconstructing of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.729" end="00:04:23.510" style="s2">truth by post-modernism which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.340" end="00:04:25.639" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.510" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">like something specific and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.639" end="00:04:32.870" style="s2">deconstructing of like experience of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:36.770" style="s2">self and reality in terms of some</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.870" end="00:04:38.449" style="s2">discourses and Buddhism right and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.770" end="00:04:39.380" style="s2">specifically Buddhism and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.449" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">people I&#39;m talking about really having</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.380" end="00:04:44.900" style="s2">even like read a Buddhist Sutra but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:46.580" style="s2">they&#39;re getting is the notion that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">you analyze your own experience like of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.580" end="00:04:50.030" style="s2">a boss on a meditator you will realize</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:51.889" style="s2">that most of the things you take to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.030" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">true or not simply true right that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.889" end="00:04:59.290" style="s2">there&#39;s some deeper reality beyond they</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">kind of given phenomenology so emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.290" end="00:05:05.300" style="s2">different than form mostly we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:07.700" style="s2">experience I&#39;m Dennis although even it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.300" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">always already there and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.700" end="00:05:10.790" style="s2">post-modernism is doing something</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:12.650" style="s2">specific in linguistics all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.790" end="00:05:14.180" style="s2">taking aim at the modern notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.650" end="00:05:15.289" style="s2">objectivity and these other things and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.180" end="00:05:19.539" style="s2">so you give this confidence where you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.289" end="00:05:25.729" style="s2">get a relativistic post-modernism with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.539" end="00:05:28.880" style="s2">particular brand of kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.729" end="00:05:31.100" style="s2">criticism of the kind of conventional</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.880" end="00:05:35.090" style="s2">reality let&#39;s say it&#39;s the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.100" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">criticism and so though you end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.090" end="00:05:41.479" style="s2">getting people denying that viruses</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:44.630" style="s2">exist right and that we have bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.479" end="00:05:49.990" style="s2">then right correct and thanking the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.630" end="00:05:53.389" style="s2">virus and writing a whole long things</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.990" end="00:05:54.380" style="s2">where they end up saying that actually I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.389" end="00:05:55.820" style="s2">don&#39;t believe any of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.380" end="00:05:57.229" style="s2">saying that&#39;s not right we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.820" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2">believe anything you can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.229" end="00:06:00.760" style="s2">anything we don&#39;t know anything but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:03.830" style="s2">here&#39;s a long list of things I believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.760" end="00:06:06.740" style="s2">but I don&#39;t really believe that and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.830" end="00:06:08.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack of courage and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.740" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">fortitude on the part of those people</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.870" end="00:06:16.849" style="s2">who are or are people are looking to for</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:18.169" style="s2">that and so yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.849" end="00:06:21.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just concerning and it&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.169" end="00:06:25.639" style="s2">it&#39;s still still going on you know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.560" end="00:06:27.139" style="s2">that kind of that kind of view so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.639" end="00:06:29.389" style="s2">some sense this was a response to that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.139" end="00:06:30.889" style="s2">was trying to you know as you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.389" end="00:06:33.890" style="s2">not a reasonable piece but I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.889" end="00:06:36.470" style="s2">the piece is not unreasonable and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.890" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">trying to say reasonable things about</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.470" end="00:06:44.150" style="s2">topics instead of thinking that saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:45.380" style="s2">something unreasonable is profound just</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.150" end="00:06:47.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s unreasonable or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.380" end="00:06:50.150" style="s2">unreasonable when me and John we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.300" end="00:06:53.480" style="s2">talking the last time with Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.150" end="00:06:56.480" style="s2">or master of Pietro in the midst of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.480" end="00:06:59.090" style="s2">conversation I came up with this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.480" end="00:07:00.590" style="s2">thing I said this is like a judgment or</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.090" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">something right what&#39;s happening it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.590" end="00:07:05.690" style="s2">came into my mind right as a biblical</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:08.840" style="s2">language and John was saying wait a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.690" end="00:07:11.540" style="s2">minute hold on here be careful so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.840" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">John you want to speak to to the the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.540" end="00:07:17.060" style="s2">cut your cautionary sure response to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:19.430" style="s2">dangers of using this kind of language</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.060" end="00:07:22.550" style="s2">and how can we use this kind of poetic</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.430" end="00:07:24.590" style="s2">language correctly or rightly err in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.550" end="00:07:26.690" style="s2">way that&#39;s helpful one I think Zach did</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.590" end="00:07:29.150" style="s2">a great job of doing I do attitude so</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:30.890" style="s2">first of all compliment Zach I read the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.150" end="00:07:34.040" style="s2">article and I thought it was exemplary</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.890" end="00:07:38.330" style="s2">of how to use what I would call symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.040" end="00:07:40.970" style="s2">language in order to make important</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:43.310" style="s2">bridges symbol on to connect between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.970" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">phenomenological and what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.310" end="00:07:46.370" style="s2">the ontological because I saw that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:48.410" style="s2">large part of what the essay was doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.370" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">was exactly using what you&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.410" end="00:07:52.190" style="s2">myth or poetic language to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">between those two domains for people in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.190" end="00:07:57.830" style="s2">a very powerful way I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:59.030" style="s2">important we can talk about that more as</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.830" end="00:08:01.190" style="s2">we go into our discussion but I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.030" end="00:08:02.870" style="s2">that how do you how do you get craft a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.190" end="00:08:05.419" style="s2">language that&#39;s you know deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.870" end="00:08:07.190" style="s2">transgender that deeply resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.419" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">people&#39;s phenomenological experience and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.190" end="00:08:12.710" style="s2">yet also gives them you know a way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.669" style="s2">articulating a grasp on reality that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.710" end="00:08:15.770" style="s2">very needed right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.669" end="00:08:18.169" style="s2">and I thought what Zach was doing was</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.770" end="00:08:20.150" style="s2">exemplifying that very well that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.169" end="00:08:24.350" style="s2">it landed for me that that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:28.729" style="s2">language was coming up the biblical and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.350" end="00:08:30.050" style="s2">so the biblical language I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.729" end="00:08:32.690" style="s2">cautioned people I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.050" end="00:08:35.630" style="s2">appropriate attitude toward the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.690" end="00:08:38.630" style="s2">a deeply reverential ambivalence the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.630" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">Bible is it is a terrible book in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.630" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">sense of its capacity to cause great</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:48.110" style="s2">harm but also in its terrific in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">sense that it can induce significant</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.110" end="00:08:53.420" style="s2">powerful and transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">people so the biblical language my</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.420" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">concern is I share one with Zach and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">then one that I think he might have also</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:04.630" style="s2">I think he&#39;s he steered very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:08.090" style="s2">adroitly between Scylla and Charybdis</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.630" end="00:09:10.010" style="s2">they&#39;re very nicely between a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.090" end="00:09:12.350" style="s2">fundamentalist return of this language</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.010" end="00:09:14.420" style="s2">because my concern is and I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.350" end="00:09:16.670" style="s2">lot of people talking this way the virus</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.420" end="00:09:19.820" style="s2">is very much like an Old Testament deity</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.670" end="00:09:23.270" style="s2">it&#39;s abstract it&#39;s ubiquitous you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.820" end="00:09:25.430" style="s2">know what it will strike right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.270" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">demanding purity codes from us</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.430" end="00:09:28.760" style="s2">it&#39;s narrowing our world we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:31.430" style="s2">we&#39;re under judgment we feel like we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.430" end="00:09:35.900" style="s2">invoke purity codes and this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.290" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">ancient way of thinking for us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.900" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">very problematic I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">very antithetical to the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:48.280" style="s2">zach is pointing to in his paper in his</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">article if we if that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.280" end="00:09:53.180" style="s2">becomes prevalent and then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:54.589" style="s2">alternative and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.589" end="00:09:57.770" style="s2">culture pretends that they are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.210" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">alternative is is the kind of decadent</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.770" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">Romanticism that Zach put his finger on</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:05.420" style="s2">that spirituality that lacks integrity</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">not only courage Zach I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.420" end="00:10:09.650" style="s2">lacks integrity in that what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">it privileges certain kinds of discourse</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.650" end="00:10:13.280" style="s2">well of course claiming that no</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">discourse has privileged it claims a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.280" end="00:10:17.000" style="s2">kind of exceptionalism for Buddhism that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.170" end="00:10:19.310" style="s2">people like Stephen bachelor and Evan</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.000" end="00:10:22.940" style="s2">Thompson have just shown is without</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.310" end="00:10:24.770" style="s2">merit as an argument it does a very poor</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.940" end="00:10:26.620" style="s2">job opposite I would say to what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.770" end="00:10:31.060" style="s2">were trying to do Zach and succeeding at</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.620" end="00:10:31.060" style="s2">bridging between the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t set up an agave what it does</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:37.850" style="s2">is it says all everything is to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.080" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2">constructed in here everything is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.850" end="00:10:41.450" style="s2">deconstructed out there and therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.500" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">ultimately get some kind of nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.450" end="00:10:45.230" style="s2">conformity between my inner world and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:50.300" style="s2">outer world because they&#39;re all equally</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.230" end="00:10:53.930" style="s2">deconstructed which is I think precious</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.300" end="00:10:59.180" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of irresponsible in a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.930" end="00:11:02.270" style="s2">powerful way so I think I didn&#39;t I I saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.180" end="00:11:03.870" style="s2">Zach as like I say steering between both</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.270" end="00:11:06.150" style="s2">of those ways in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.870" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">we could start using I agree with Zack</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.150" end="00:11:10.589" style="s2">fundamentally on this that when were in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.540" style="s2">liminal right and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.589" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">the phenomenology and the ontology are</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.540" end="00:11:18.120" style="s2">in this like the deep like talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:20.070" style="s2">other when we&#39;re in liminal we are drawn</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.120" end="00:11:22.920" style="s2">towards this kind of language I totally</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.070" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">agree what I&#39;m suggesting is the what</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.920" end="00:11:27.720" style="s2">the we can be drawn and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.160" end="00:11:29.850" style="s2">articulate and appropriate that language</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.720" end="00:11:32.070" style="s2">in three different ways at least to my</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.850" end="00:11:33.750" style="s2">mind one is the one that Zack is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.070" end="00:11:35.430" style="s2">critical of and I am too</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.750" end="00:11:38.430" style="s2">the sort of decadent romanticism that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.430" end="00:11:41.520" style="s2">has that purely negative and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.430" end="00:11:44.760" style="s2">vacuous conformity and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.520" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">kind of fundamentalism that I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.760" end="00:11:49.260" style="s2">especially when we&#39;re enacting purity</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.730" style="s2">codes is a very real danger and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.260" end="00:11:53.750" style="s2">and the attendant things upon it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.730" end="00:11:56.130" style="s2">know conspiracy theory scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.750" end="00:11:58.650" style="s2">before all things we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.130" end="00:12:02.100" style="s2">very careful of and so I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.650" end="00:12:04.350" style="s2">what Zack did was from and perhaps sec</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.100" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">this is one of the reasons why it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.350" end="00:12:08.430" style="s2">getting such a great reception i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:09.779" style="s2">you in addition to the content which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.430" end="00:12:12.660" style="s2">think was valuable I think you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.779" end="00:12:15.150" style="s2">exemplified a way of appropriating this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.660" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">language that as I again I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.150" end="00:12:22.080" style="s2">you is what is going to emerge as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:23.550" style="s2">response to the attempt to symbol on to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.080" end="00:12:26.850" style="s2">connect the phenomenological neon</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.550" end="00:12:28.260" style="s2">logical and you steered it between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.850" end="00:12:30.360" style="s2">two things that I&#39;m most concerned of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.260" end="00:12:32.300" style="s2">well I have three there but two I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.360" end="00:12:35.459" style="s2">articulated one is the fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.300" end="00:12:37.350" style="s2">the other is you know like you say the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.459" end="00:12:39.029" style="s2">completely decadent romantic magical</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.350" end="00:12:41.100" style="s2">thinking bullshit I would put it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.029" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">using that term technically right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.100" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">then the third one I have a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:47.670" style="s2">which you also didn&#39;t do you took great</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:50.220" style="s2">care of which is a kind of pretentious</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.670" end="00:12:52.680" style="s2">utopian certainty well you know this</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.220" end="00:12:54.870" style="s2">clearly indicates that the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.680" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">should come and this is blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.870" end="00:13:00.330" style="s2">blah right and and that kind of thing -</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">and I mean it right and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.330" end="00:13:03.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger of course around</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:07.740" style="s2">apocalyptic thinking to fall into that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.870" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">kind of utopic pseudo certainty and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.740" end="00:13:12.930" style="s2">think you steered between all three of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:15.240" style="s2">those really really well so that&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.930" end="00:13:17.549" style="s2">there&#39;s sorry ginger maybe there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.240" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">a danger of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.549" end="00:13:22.599" style="s2">with this eschatology is life hating or</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.160" end="00:13:23.829" style="s2">something it&#39;s like you want the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.599" end="00:13:26.259" style="s2">apocalypse to happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.829" end="00:13:28.989" style="s2">well that overlaps a lot with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.259" end="00:13:32.739" style="s2">fundamentalism fundamentalism tends to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.989" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">you know you know the emphasis is on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.739" end="00:13:38.589" style="s2">the destructive nature of God&#39;s wrath</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:40.689" style="s2">and in it that&#39;s usually bound up with a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.589" end="00:13:42.789" style="s2">kind of conspiratorial there&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.689" end="00:13:44.949" style="s2">evil ones out there that I resent and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.789" end="00:13:47.709" style="s2">hate and I&#39;m afraid of and this will</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.949" end="00:13:50.529" style="s2">finally get rid of them and those of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.709" end="00:13:52.569" style="s2">who are pure will be set free to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.529" end="00:13:55.299" style="s2">earth that kind of thing and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.569" end="00:13:58.869" style="s2">fundamentalist view and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.299" end="00:14:01.629" style="s2">the the new-age view there are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.869" end="00:14:04.149" style="s2">isomorphic in their structure like yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.629" end="00:14:06.699" style="s2">yeah there there&#39;s a there&#39;s a basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.149" end="00:14:09.879" style="s2">kind of a structural narcissism yes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.699" end="00:14:12.699" style="s2">a tendency to project and basically it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.879" end="00:14:15.149" style="s2">stands of like mind or faith only which</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.699" end="00:14:18.159" style="s2">ends up being you create your reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.149" end="00:14:23.559" style="s2">kind of thing or basically you get what</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.159" end="00:14:25.809" style="s2">you deserve yes and so that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.559" end="00:14:27.609" style="s2">that&#39;s just there and as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.809" end="00:14:30.459" style="s2">developmental psychologist it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.609" end="00:14:34.179" style="s2">see the places in people&#39;s personalities</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.459" end="00:14:37.989" style="s2">where they can actually retreat to lower</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.179" end="00:14:41.859" style="s2">forms of meaning making and self</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.989" end="00:14:43.989" style="s2">regulation so so you allowed it to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.859" end="00:14:45.759" style="s2">very clearly when you talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.989" end="00:14:48.100" style="s2">possibility of losing the world&#39;s soul</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.759" end="00:14:49.419" style="s2">and falling in with this Chi pen I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.100" end="00:14:51.009" style="s2">wanted to unpack that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.419" end="00:14:53.769" style="s2">because I thought you were implying and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.009" end="00:14:55.959" style="s2">and just add to that are also tragic you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.769" end="00:14:58.239" style="s2">talked about the tragic and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.959" end="00:15:00.429" style="s2">a remedy to this New Age thinking is for</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.239" end="00:15:04.269" style="s2">us to really contemplate the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.429" end="00:15:05.769" style="s2">right yeah I think of John as you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.269" end="00:15:07.959" style="s2">speaking I was thinking of this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.769" end="00:15:10.829" style="s2">by Harbor moss it was something like cuz</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.959" end="00:15:12.909" style="s2">you know he brought his dissertation on</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.829" end="00:15:14.769" style="s2">shelling and the problem of free will</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.909" end="00:15:17.289" style="s2">and then later in this life Habermas</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.769" end="00:15:19.179" style="s2">returned to Kierkegaard and began to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.289" end="00:15:21.129" style="s2">consider religion again very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.179" end="00:15:25.329" style="s2">and in this later work he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.129" end="00:15:28.310" style="s2">the the untapped semantic potentials of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.329" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">religious language yes I mean that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.310" end="00:15:33.620" style="s2">there lay within religious language and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:36.199" style="s2">symbol untapped semantic potential</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.620" end="00:15:38.660" style="s2">specifically and this is it to think for</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.199" end="00:15:40.999" style="s2">protecting vulnerable forms of community</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.660" end="00:15:44.449" style="s2">life and experience so the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.999" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">that the meaning that lies hidden within</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.449" end="00:15:51.889" style="s2">these symbolic ways of speaking it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:55.550" style="s2">to do with the basis of choice making</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.889" end="00:15:57.470" style="s2">and relationship and ethics Frank which</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.550" end="00:15:58.970" style="s2">is also another difference between I</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.470" end="00:16:02.600" style="s2">think what I was trying to do and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.970" end="00:16:06.350" style="s2">is usually happening under the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.600" end="00:16:09.879" style="s2">kind of rhetoric which is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.350" end="00:16:12.949" style="s2">to inform the basis of ethics and choice</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.879" end="00:16:15.050" style="s2">not the basis of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.949" end="00:16:16.930" style="s2">self-regulation and the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.050" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">safety base of and self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.930" end="00:16:22.540" style="s2">gratifications right so those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:25.790" style="s2">distinct and the mind wants to do both</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.540" end="00:16:27.470" style="s2">like you want to create a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.790" end="00:16:29.509" style="s2">meaning in a worldview that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.470" end="00:16:34.699" style="s2">feel safe and makes you feel valuable</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.509" end="00:16:36.319" style="s2">and important and in control and but you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.699" end="00:16:38.959" style="s2">also want to create one that allows you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.319" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">to live in relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.959" end="00:16:45.230" style="s2">and specifically the reality that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:47.750" style="s2">have other people and and so yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:53.649" style="s2">trying to really bring home something</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.750" end="00:16:55.699" style="s2">like in an ethos and and the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.649" end="00:16:58.699" style="s2">you know for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.699" end="00:17:02.269" style="s2">morality which is relevant now which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.699" end="00:17:04.370" style="s2">why I was concerned about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.269" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">able to say on a hospital ward in New</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.370" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">York City right like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">get that can be said in these places and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:17.030" style="s2">how important that must be right be able</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">to say the right things to people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.030" end="00:17:20.510" style="s2">are actually suffering not people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:23.419" style="s2">are afraid of suffering and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.510" end="00:17:24.770" style="s2">reconcile themselves and the calm their</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.419" end="00:17:27.649" style="s2">limbic system after looking at Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.770" end="00:17:31.130" style="s2">for an hour and a half people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.649" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">the midst of it and where are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.130" end="00:17:34.340" style="s2">cultural resources we can use in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:36.290" style="s2">languages that are available in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:38.570" style="s2">symbols that are shared between us where</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.290" end="00:17:42.860" style="s2">can be with one another in the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.570" end="00:17:44.090" style="s2">intensity of this and say something so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.860" end="00:17:46.310" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of where where it came from</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.090" end="00:17:48.680" style="s2">and then I ended up returning to my</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.310" end="00:17:50.780" style="s2">roots in Emerson and other places where</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.680" end="00:17:54.500" style="s2">I was looking for this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.780" end="00:17:57.830" style="s2">language so and also just to my</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.500" end="00:17:59.630" style="s2">background in music you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.830" end="00:18:03.890" style="s2">often about this triplet kid I got from</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.630" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">Forrest Landry which is song text and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.890" end="00:18:10.010" style="s2">code be in different forms of expression</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.590" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">and that all of them are important and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.010" end="00:18:13.100" style="s2">code is about what you do so let it be</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">written so let it be done like a legal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.100" end="00:18:17.240" style="s2">code right and text is about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:19.550" style="s2">interest objective clarity of semantics</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.240" end="00:18:22.790" style="s2">basically precision song is different</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.550" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">song is rooted and subjective and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.790" end="00:18:29.180" style="s2">is where symbol and image lives so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:31.370" style="s2">and so connecting song with text is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.180" end="00:18:33.770" style="s2">I was trying to do well not cuz I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.370" end="00:18:35.150" style="s2">right about the facts and legal code and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.770" end="00:18:36.230" style="s2">the quarantine and how the keeper saw I</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.150" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t good to him in there I was just</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.230" end="00:18:41.420" style="s2">trying to connect with the song that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:44.740" style="s2">was trying to sing and find me a way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.420" end="00:18:47.330" style="s2">bring that up into some space of reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">and what you&#39;re talking about is poetry</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.330" end="00:18:51.170" style="s2">you know correct right and and and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:54.020" style="s2">need for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.170" end="00:18:57.290" style="s2">right but the problem is just invoking</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.020" end="00:18:59.030" style="s2">poetry again is in poetry because of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:01.190" style="s2">know several generations and education</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.030" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">has been relegated to a certain status</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.190" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">and function with another culture but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:08.510" style="s2">think is not I not attributing this to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:10.280" style="s2">you Andrew but I&#39;m saying how most</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.510" end="00:19:12.560" style="s2">people knew when most people hear the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.280" end="00:19:15.380" style="s2">word poetry they don&#39;t hear what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.560" end="00:19:17.510" style="s2">for yeah that&#39;s true yeah right they</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.380" end="00:19:19.400" style="s2">don&#39;t and that&#39;s why there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.510" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">educational thrust towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.400" end="00:19:22.550" style="s2">Zach&#39;s article but I wanted to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.780" end="00:19:24.020" style="s2">on something first before I do want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.550" end="00:19:29.480" style="s2">turn to the educational stuff because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.020" end="00:19:31.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important so if the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.480" end="00:19:34.040" style="s2">first point you were saying about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.400" end="00:19:36.560" style="s2">Zach is the - um this goes to where</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.040" end="00:19:38.540" style="s2">Chris and I have been doing about trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.560" end="00:19:40.820" style="s2">to remember that when we invoke the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.540" end="00:19:43.550" style="s2">language the sacred has both the homing</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.820" end="00:19:45.560" style="s2">and the horror aspects to it right at</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.550" end="00:19:47.900" style="s2">the point of the sacred yes is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.560" end="00:19:50.090" style="s2">supposed to shelter us but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.900" end="00:19:52.100" style="s2">supposed to expose us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.090" end="00:19:57.799" style="s2">a reality that is beyond us that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.100" end="00:19:59.929" style="s2">numinous side of things and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.799" end="00:20:01.490" style="s2">really difficult thing that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.929" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">do right now with the symbolic language</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.490" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">is write its effect because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:08.779" style="s2">ultimately sacred language is to craft</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:11.179" style="s2">it in such a way that those two things</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.779" end="00:20:14.690" style="s2">are being done at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.179" end="00:20:17.900" style="s2">we&#39;re giving people a sense of how they</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.690" end="00:20:21.710" style="s2">can get grounded and centered but also</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.900" end="00:20:23.270" style="s2">challenge them to face the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.710" end="00:20:26.110" style="s2">transformative demands that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.270" end="00:20:29.330" style="s2">placing upon us and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.110" end="00:20:31.309" style="s2">another concern I have is a polarization</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.330" end="00:20:34.010" style="s2">of the language of the sacred either</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.309" end="00:20:35.990" style="s2">into the oh it&#39;s you know it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.010" end="00:20:38.600" style="s2">wonderful we&#39;re all snuggly and warm and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.990" end="00:20:40.390" style="s2">we all love each other or or or you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.600" end="00:20:42.679" style="s2">which is also becoming the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.390" end="00:20:44.299" style="s2">horrific nihilism with its you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.679" end="00:20:47.350" style="s2">we&#39;re all just doomed and destroyed in</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.299" end="00:20:49.429" style="s2">sort of glorying in a way that reality&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.350" end="00:20:53.390" style="s2">overwhelming because I can see some</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.429" end="00:20:57.110" style="s2">people finally finding but in a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.390" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">shadowed twisted way you know well</p>

<p begin="00:21:59.990" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">know God&#39;s self naming right but also</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.920" end="00:22:08.540" style="s2">the fact that this is ultimately</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.980" end="00:22:17.090" style="s2">guys I know I&#39;m talking a lot this</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.170" end="00:22:20.290" style="s2">brings me to this ongoing discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.090" end="00:22:22.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having with Jordan Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.290" end="00:22:25.010" style="s2">Christmas DiPietro and guys in stock and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.910" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">with you and is this whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.010" end="00:22:29.929" style="s2">what you were pointing to in your major</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:33.740" style="s2">point a minute ago Andrew sorry Zack it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.929" end="00:22:37.100" style="s2">was that right that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.740" end="00:22:38.870" style="s2">link this language to being able to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.100" end="00:22:39.919" style="s2">the right thing and do the right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.870" end="00:22:43.429" style="s2">ultimately you&#39;re trying to link it to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:46.700" style="s2">wisdom in my in my language and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.429" end="00:22:48.890" style="s2">fear near a party and care right well</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.700" end="00:22:50.660" style="s2">but that&#39;s a big part the rationality of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.890" end="00:22:52.580" style="s2">caring is what Socrates was primarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.660" end="00:22:54.380" style="s2">about above and beyond any rationality</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.580" end="00:22:57.049" style="s2">of argumentation he makes that very</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.380" end="00:22:58.820" style="s2">clear the one thing he knew was Tonica</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.049" end="00:23:02.570" style="s2">he knew how to properly care and what to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.820" end="00:23:04.549" style="s2">care about and how to care but that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.570" end="00:23:05.690" style="s2">Britta but the invoking Socrates brings</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.549" end="00:23:07.610" style="s2">up this whole thing I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.690" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">talk about this notion of faith Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.610" end="00:23:12.650" style="s2">faith because the relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">symbols is not one of conviction in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.650" end="00:23:16.309" style="s2">sense and of the way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:18.410" style="s2">argument convict&#39;s you neither should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.309" end="00:23:20.900" style="s2">and zack is critical of this just kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.410" end="00:23:22.790" style="s2">of an emotional affective response</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.900" end="00:23:25.549" style="s2">that&#39;s an inappropriate response to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.790" end="00:23:27.290" style="s2">symbols i mean so my tutor here is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.549" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">Tillich that the appropriate response to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.290" end="00:23:32.030" style="s2">symbol is faith but faith completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:34.630" style="s2">understood not as this magical</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.030" end="00:23:35.750" style="s2">projection and willful assertion or</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.630" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">passive</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.750" end="00:23:40.730" style="s2">you know acceptance of you know some</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:42.830" style="s2">fatalistic demon but more again this</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.730" end="00:23:45.350" style="s2">ability to what Zack is again I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.830" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">exemplifying in his paper which is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.350" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">sense the Kairos sense the course of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:52.970" style="s2">things and become deeply coupled and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">involved with it and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.970" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">something that needs to be talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:23:58.429" style="s2">and it&#39;s also something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:01.280" style="s2">offer people now as an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.429" end="00:24:03.650" style="s2">either magical faith or you know merely</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.280" end="00:24:05.210" style="s2">sort of assertion of faith and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.650" end="00:24:07.100" style="s2">that&#39;s also something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.210" end="00:24:09.260" style="s2">brought into this discussion and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.100" end="00:24:11.510" style="s2">is that again I don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.260" end="00:24:14.570" style="s2">foreign to your article Zack I think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.510" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">you&#39;re clearly exemplifying it in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.570" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about and the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:19.970" style="s2">you&#39;re invoking the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:23.029" style="s2">language almost in a prophetic fashion I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.970" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">totally want I just want to repeat what</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.029" end="00:24:27.500" style="s2">you said about the importance maybe of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:31.549" style="s2">joining those two worlds together right</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:34.370" style="s2">that the the the horror and and the fate</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.549" end="00:24:37.549" style="s2">that&#39;s what I am and if we if we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.370" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">in the sublime blissful world of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.549" end="00:24:41.779" style="s2">imagination it&#39;s nice but we never come</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:44.809" style="s2">down to the earth and if we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.779" end="00:24:47.029" style="s2">just in in this sort of materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.809" end="00:24:48.440" style="s2">horror you don&#39;t have any vision so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.029" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">it&#39;s bringing these two worlds together</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.440" end="00:24:54.950" style="s2">I think and what I&#39;m saying is that act</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:57.230" style="s2">of bringing them together is of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.950" end="00:24:59.659" style="s2">inherently symbolic I keep saying symbol</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.230" end="00:25:02.750" style="s2">on is to join together across the limit</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.659" end="00:25:04.549" style="s2">all right and that because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.750" end="00:25:07.130" style="s2">confronting the liminal you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.549" end="00:25:09.559" style="s2">confronting those both you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.130" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">prospect and the refuge and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.559" end="00:25:15.250" style="s2">gives you that I think is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:17.750" style="s2">faith that I&#39;m talking about now and</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.250" end="00:25:19.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a faith that in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.750" end="00:25:21.110" style="s2">and and I argue it&#39;s more than my</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.610" end="00:25:23.750" style="s2">opinion who cares about my opinion my</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.110" end="00:25:25.580" style="s2">arguments are that that notion of faith</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.750" end="00:25:27.649" style="s2">is deeply interwoven with this more</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.580" end="00:25:29.899" style="s2">extended Socratic notion of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.649" end="00:25:31.909" style="s2">and the wisdom project that I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.899" end="00:25:37.669" style="s2">exact is invoking in the pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.909" end="00:25:40.450" style="s2">part of his article beautiful gas I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.669" end="00:25:44.149" style="s2">there&#39;s so many directions to go now</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.450" end="00:25:45.649" style="s2">like I&#39;m wondering what Andrew what what</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.149" end="00:25:47.890" style="s2">did you have in mind what comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.649" end="00:25:50.299" style="s2">for me is this notion of the the post</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.890" end="00:25:52.940" style="s2">tragic and the notion I was thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.299" end="00:25:55.070" style="s2">the future I was thinking of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.940" end="00:25:57.620" style="s2">prophetic and and the future and how we</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.070" end="00:25:59.090" style="s2">use symbols because we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.620" end="00:26:01.549" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.090" end="00:26:04.490" style="s2">immediacy of what&#39;s happening so we use</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.549" end="00:26:06.860" style="s2">symbols as kind of a vehicle to take us</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.490" end="00:26:09.130" style="s2">towards the future is that does that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.860" end="00:26:13.300" style="s2">ring true in any kind of a way or um</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.130" end="00:26:14.860" style="s2">does does I mean that&#39;s you know</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.860" end="00:26:19.690" style="s2">the word that came to mind now is a</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.789" end="00:26:43.690" style="s2">mandala quite a light language where</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.690" end="00:26:48.250" style="s2">a very intense way I write I talk about</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.250" end="00:26:53.049" style="s2">in this notion of the thoughts of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">heart yes comes from James James Hillman</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.809" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">irrational or based on just phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.289" end="00:27:45.429" style="s2">experience or ecstatic experience or</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:48.190" style="s2">those kind of things so it&#39;s this hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.429" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">language like you&#39;re saying which which</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.190" end="00:27:52.510" style="s2">brings the two together and then it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:54.070" style="s2">take the particular take the best of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:57.010" style="s2">science and does not contradict that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.070" end="00:27:59.590" style="s2">and it can take the best of the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.010" end="00:28:01.809" style="s2">and the purely prophetic and those</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:05.049" style="s2">things and bring them together and good</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.809" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">and thoughts of the heart are the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.049" end="00:28:11.320" style="s2">universal thoughts and forms of language</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">and so they are a kind of common sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.320" end="00:28:19.779" style="s2">if I can use that way of speaking but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:22.029" style="s2">they do sometimes end up being cloaked</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.779" end="00:28:25.480" style="s2">in things that look like traditional</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.029" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">religious forms of language and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.480" end="00:28:29.080" style="s2">that&#39;s I find the biggest trick now</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:32.410" style="s2">when I&#39;m working with these modalities</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.080" end="00:28:36.130" style="s2">is to not basically offend the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:38.620" style="s2">scientists right one issue and then the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.130" end="00:28:39.910" style="s2">other issue is not to to make it complex</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.620" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">enough that you don&#39;t get it confused</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.910" end="00:28:43.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just being New Age alright so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:45.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to you don&#39;t want to offend</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.720" end="00:28:48.010" style="s2">the scientists who dismiss you as being</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.960" end="00:28:49.450" style="s2">fundamentalists or something and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.010" end="00:28:52.150" style="s2">you also don&#39;t want to attract a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.450" end="00:28:54.670" style="s2">of people who are actually looking for</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.150" end="00:28:57.160" style="s2">something much simpler just to gratify</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.670" end="00:29:02.920" style="s2">their ego needs for safety and control</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.160" end="00:29:06.520" style="s2">justice a new age market coerce and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.920" end="00:29:08.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the death dance and yeah I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.520" end="00:29:12.040" style="s2">kind of overwhelmed actually the key to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.860" end="00:29:16.750" style="s2">getting the the the praise for the paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.040" end="00:29:19.420" style="s2">I read wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t expecting it but</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.750" end="00:29:21.070" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s what one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.420" end="00:29:22.780" style="s2">that came to mind there and then as I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.070" end="00:29:26.310" style="s2">was saying this notion of that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.780" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">sacred includes the kind of terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.310" end="00:29:33.460" style="s2">and that is also that with this notion</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:35.500" style="s2">of that post tragic being extremely</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.460" end="00:29:39.240" style="s2">important some have talked about in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.500" end="00:29:44.140" style="s2">few podcasts and the idea of being that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.240" end="00:29:47.700" style="s2">when tragedies there he it must be lived</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.140" end="00:29:49.690" style="s2">through yeah it can&#39;t be avoided and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.700" end="00:29:52.510" style="s2">dealing with it actually it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.690" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">fixing it or making the tragic disappear</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.510" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">dealing with it actually means finding a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">way to have it and more and I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:10.060" style="s2">what is within illness and what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:14.770" style="s2">within death that unravel it from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.060" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">inside which is to say as hospice</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.770" end="00:30:18.670" style="s2">workers know and health care workers now</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:25.920" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been a caregiver for</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.670" end="00:30:30.420" style="s2">many years in my life and that there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.920" end="00:30:33.550" style="s2">what&#39;s the right way to say it you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.420" end="00:30:40.600" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;ll use symbolic language right</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.550" end="00:30:42.670" style="s2">which is that God will catch you</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.600" end="00:30:44.710" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that is that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.670" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere you can fall where you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.710" end="00:30:50.830" style="s2">fall outside of God all right something</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:53.610" style="s2">like that and and that includes all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.830" end="00:30:59.860" style="s2">the horror find that God is within that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.610" end="00:31:02.860" style="s2">darkness and so yeah so so again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.860" end="00:31:05.560" style="s2">not about being stuck in the tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.860" end="00:31:08.920" style="s2">saying oh it&#39;s just horror right as I</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.560" end="00:31:14.050" style="s2">know it is horror but humans can</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.920" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">withstand our they and humans are made</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.050" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">in the midst of tragedy so so much of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:23.230" style="s2">history has been humans making</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:25.390" style="s2">personhood in the midst of tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.230" end="00:31:27.460" style="s2">so again the untapped semantic potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.390" end="00:31:29.500" style="s2">of religious language is for protecting</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.460" end="00:31:32.620" style="s2">vulnerable forms of human life these are</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.500" end="00:31:35.790" style="s2">the things we&#39;ve done to be together and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.620" end="00:31:38.350" style="s2">with glad hearts in the midst of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.790" end="00:31:42.450" style="s2">that&#39;s where the Bible is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.350" end="00:31:46.330" style="s2">because it is so political so political</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.450" end="00:31:48.130" style="s2">slavery and freedom and onion just</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.330" end="00:31:52.030" style="s2">answers all of these stories of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.130" end="00:31:56.050" style="s2">in intense and plagues of course people</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.030" end="00:32:00.940" style="s2">in intense intense interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.050" end="00:32:06.700" style="s2">and so so yeah it&#39;s not abstract in many</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.940" end="00:32:10.540" style="s2">cases the Bible is just there and and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.700" end="00:32:13.810" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s that there&#39;s that encoding</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.540" end="00:32:15.520" style="s2">and human experience of making meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.810" end="00:32:18.730" style="s2">and personhood in the midst of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.520" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">and and so that&#39;s just I&#39;m saying when</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.730" end="00:32:22.510" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing these languages together</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:24.820" style="s2">you know to what end it&#39;s because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.510" end="00:32:26.980" style="s2">think it impart of that need to create</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.820" end="00:32:30.100" style="s2">the new religion right this new form of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.980" end="00:32:31.750" style="s2">religiosity would be that&#39;s coming at us</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.100" end="00:32:33.700" style="s2">again now at a higher register that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.750" end="00:32:35.500" style="s2">demand from the world that&#39;s saying look</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.700" end="00:32:37.540" style="s2">at look at the suffering of the pain</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.500" end="00:32:39.340" style="s2">that&#39;s unfolding and how do we come</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.540" end="00:32:41.470" style="s2">together in the midst of this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.340" end="00:32:46.150" style="s2">about what we&#39;re trying to do here in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.470" end="00:32:49.410" style="s2">sense with the creation of a new a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.150" end="00:32:53.430" style="s2">renew resources of symbol and language</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.410" end="00:32:57.380" style="s2">for meaning-making yeah because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.430" end="00:33:02.040" style="s2">the guy in in the hospital in New York</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.380" end="00:33:04.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have time for figuring things</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.040" end="00:33:07.740" style="s2">out in a very reductive way he just</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.350" end="00:33:12.920" style="s2">wants the truth and the truth has to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.740" end="00:33:16.530" style="s2">deep right it can&#39;t be superficial or or</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.920" end="00:33:18.840" style="s2">and and I guess the kind of God you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.530" end="00:33:20.670" style="s2">speaking of you know this is their that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.840" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">and that contains both the darkness and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.670" end="00:33:27.510" style="s2">the light or both the horror and and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:29.340" style="s2">beauty so it&#39;s like you don&#39;t want one</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.510" end="00:33:31.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to split those two you</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.340" end="00:33:33.750" style="s2">want you if you&#39;re on your deathbed I</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.890" end="00:33:36.870" style="s2">imagine I&#39;ve never been on my deathbed</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.750" end="00:33:39.030" style="s2">but you would want things to be as close</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.870" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">to the bone and it is true as as</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.030" end="00:33:45.660" style="s2">possible and I often religious language</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:49.140" style="s2">may be the only way to to express that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.660" end="00:33:52.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know well or the heart spoken as</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.140" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">directly as possible but but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.140" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">is it has to take yeah the thing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:59.040" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing worse than these words</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:02.280" style="s2">being spoken and they don&#39;t take for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.040" end="00:34:03.330" style="s2">person right indeed yeah right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.280" end="00:34:06.750" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get out with this</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.330" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">this notion of faith where it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.750" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">not willful assertion not magical</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:12.570" style="s2">thinking are not claiming to know things</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:14.490" style="s2">that you don&#39;t actually have any claim</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.570" end="00:34:15.660" style="s2">to know it&#39;s not a pretense of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.490" end="00:34:18.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not all the things that we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.660" end="00:34:22.169" style="s2">pretend faith is no it&#39;s a it&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.840" end="00:34:25.290" style="s2">the sense there&#39;s a beauty and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.169" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">mean a pleasure because beauty can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.290" end="00:34:28.410" style="s2">terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:30.120" style="s2">Rilke reminds us of that repeatedly but</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.410" end="00:34:31.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a beauty to these symbols for</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.120" end="00:34:33.450" style="s2">people there&#39;s there they have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.500" end="00:34:35.730" style="s2">receptivity that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.450" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">get at so that they take the symbols</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.730" end="00:34:41.160" style="s2">take they catch they write today they</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:43.650" style="s2">join the worlds together they they</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.160" end="00:34:45.810" style="s2">afford aspiration they call the person</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.650" end="00:34:47.550" style="s2">to the depths that you&#39;re putting your</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.810" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">finger on Andrew I&#39;m really interested</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.550" end="00:34:52.020" style="s2">in that and by the way I want to point</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:54.570" style="s2">out you know when Socrates was doing his</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.020" end="00:34:57.510" style="s2">thing Athens was literally under siege</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.570" end="00:35:00.090" style="s2">from without and there had literally</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.510" end="00:35:02.040" style="s2">been a devastating plague in the city so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.090" end="00:35:03.170" style="s2">Socrates is not also not a figure that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.040" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">is somehow</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.339" end="00:35:32.510" style="s2">invoked him and because I he seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.470" end="00:35:34.760" style="s2">be able to do that he seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.510" end="00:35:37.099" style="s2">yellow like Zack said he can he could</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.099" end="00:35:40.970" style="s2">had the faith of being able to show up</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.690" end="00:35:43.460" style="s2">and he had the faith that he could say</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.119" end="00:35:55.250" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting to me what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.819" end="00:35:57.530" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.250" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">is ultimately what I want to really get</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.530" end="00:36:02.030" style="s2">to with Zack stop was what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:06.950" style="s2">educational background that makes people</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.030" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">capable of appropriately being called by</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.950" end="00:36:11.390" style="s2">these symbols so that they take and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.990" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">they&#39;re operationally viable to them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.390" end="00:36:16.790" style="s2">people who wear it falls dead on their</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:20.059" style="s2">chest it&#39;s just empty words or they get</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.790" end="00:36:23.780" style="s2">all of the stuff we&#39;re critical all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.059" end="00:36:26.180" style="s2">you know the the willful assertion</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.780" end="00:36:28.490" style="s2">magical thinking senses of how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.180" end="00:36:30.829" style="s2">misappropriate the sometimes that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.490" end="00:36:33.049" style="s2">for me where this is the knife edge</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.829" end="00:36:34.849" style="s2">question that&#39;s coming down how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.049" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">what do we give to people how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.849" end="00:36:39.319" style="s2">adduce how do we draw forth from them</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:41.329" style="s2">this capacity for this kind of faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.319" end="00:36:44.150" style="s2">well what I mean by faith is to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.329" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">caught up in the the terrible beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.150" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">this symbol so that one is called to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:50.869" style="s2">one&#39;s depth and one is drawn out</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:52.910" style="s2">aspirationally into the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.869" end="00:36:55.010" style="s2">world so that one can confront the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.910" end="00:36:57.410" style="s2">deepest things with the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.010" end="00:36:59.420" style="s2">resources at ones disposal that for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.410" end="00:37:02.329" style="s2">is the central question that i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.420" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">well that&#39;s forgive me Zack that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.329" end="00:37:06.940" style="s2">I saw the paper as really driving</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:12.530" style="s2">towards at the end</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.940" end="00:37:15.800" style="s2">no no that&#39;s such a good question such a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.530" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">good set of questions right cuz it&#39;s cuz</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.800" end="00:37:19.610" style="s2">this is what what&#39;s the termite pearls</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:22.970" style="s2">before swine</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.610" end="00:37:24.890" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s like and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.970" end="00:37:28.340" style="s2">classic educational problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.890" end="00:37:32.390" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a depth to</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.340" end="00:37:35.240" style="s2">like a you know an ancient text which</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.390" end="00:37:37.070" style="s2">you know you wonder the level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.240" end="00:37:39.410" style="s2">maturity of the reader that&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.070" end="00:37:42.140" style="s2">actually perceive the depth and so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.410" end="00:37:44.330" style="s2">get what are the prerequisites in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.140" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">personality and character structure and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.330" end="00:37:53.110" style="s2">cognition and other things to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:53.110" style="s2">receive the symbol that&#39;s there and -</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.170" end="00:37:58.340" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a that&#39;s the well</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.110" end="00:38:04.030" style="s2">there&#39;s two things I just suddenly come</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.340" end="00:38:07.160" style="s2">to mind you know one is experiences</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.030" end="00:38:09.230" style="s2">formative experiences where the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.160" end="00:38:13.910" style="s2">symbol or comparable symbols or</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.230" end="00:38:16.850" style="s2">modalities of expression were terrible</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.910" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">for you right so many of the people I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.850" end="00:38:22.700" style="s2">know who find it hard to be receptive to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:25.220" style="s2">the language in an article like the one</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.700" end="00:38:26.450" style="s2">I wrote you know had and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.220" end="00:38:29.060" style="s2">mentioned this last time we spoke John</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.450" end="00:38:32.030" style="s2">they had bad experiences in their in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.060" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">their youth right yeah a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.030" end="00:38:38.780" style="s2">of bullshit yeah that happened to use</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">this kind of symbol thing and so so</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.780" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one major important element there</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.180" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">which is that like this stuff&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:48.440" style="s2">given a bad name you know and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:52.670" style="s2">way that it&#39;s like the wells been</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.440" end="00:38:54.740" style="s2">poisoned and so how do we make it clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.670" end="00:38:57.380" style="s2">that we&#39;re drawing from a clear spring</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.740" end="00:39:00.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s a different source and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.380" end="00:39:02.360" style="s2">that&#39;s why many people leave there they</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.350" end="00:39:04.730" style="s2">go to the yeast right or they go from</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.360" end="00:39:08.390" style="s2">the east of the West depending on where</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.730" end="00:39:10.310" style="s2">you&#39;re where you&#39;re from so that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.390" end="00:39:13.270" style="s2">think one component so there&#39;s a part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.310" end="00:39:16.370" style="s2">it which means it&#39;s something about like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.270" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">either making it explicit I&#39;m working it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.370" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:26.650" style="s2">or finding a novelty a real novelty than</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.220" end="00:39:28.270" style="s2">the way the things are expressed so</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.650" end="00:39:31.510" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the issue there and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.270" end="00:39:34.600" style="s2">the other the other component that came</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.510" end="00:39:37.510" style="s2">to mind has to do with element of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.600" end="00:39:39.700" style="s2">practice and modeling yeah which is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.510" end="00:39:42.940" style="s2">have you ever seen someone in your</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.700" end="00:39:44.920" style="s2">actual presence do that then right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.940" end="00:39:48.910" style="s2">have you experienced an elder or a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.920" end="00:39:50.950" style="s2">teacher truly being inspired by ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.910" end="00:39:53.320" style="s2">and I think John this is why your work</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.950" end="00:39:56.530" style="s2">is so magnetic right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.320" end="00:39:58.120" style="s2">modeling for people what it&#39;s like to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.530" end="00:39:59.800" style="s2">what you&#39;re asking them to do you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.120" end="00:40:01.870" style="s2">showing that like this is what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.800" end="00:40:04.540" style="s2">to be taken into the matrix of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.870" end="00:40:07.230" style="s2">symbol and live in it and work with it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.540" end="00:40:09.700" style="s2">the power that comes from that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.230" end="00:40:13.090" style="s2">faith and the life of ideas and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.700" end="00:40:15.430" style="s2">kind of thing so another thing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.090" end="00:40:16.900" style="s2">clear that when people see it when they</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.430" end="00:40:19.510" style="s2">actually see it there they knit is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.900" end="00:40:21.910" style="s2">magnetic and people move towards that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.510" end="00:40:24.550" style="s2">this is a question of which points in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.910" end="00:40:26.590" style="s2">their lives and especially formative</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.550" end="00:40:30.520" style="s2">phases of adolescent identity formation</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.590" end="00:40:32.200" style="s2">and an adult like these key phases who</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.520" end="00:40:34.600" style="s2">or the different spokespeople there for</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.200" end="00:40:38.350" style="s2">these things and are they getting it at</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.600" end="00:40:40.900" style="s2">the right times such that when they need</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.350" end="00:40:44.770" style="s2">it they&#39;ll be able to turn to it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.900" end="00:40:46.870" style="s2">for solace and and the final one I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.770" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">is really did this notion of practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.870" end="00:40:54.730" style="s2">just a little bit deeper which is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:59.320" style="s2">it takes sustained attention to reap the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.730" end="00:41:02.710" style="s2">rewards of this kind of emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.320" end="00:41:05.130" style="s2">identity configuration so to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.710" end="00:41:07.000" style="s2">that we are becoming as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.130" end="00:41:08.890" style="s2">systematically fragmented in our</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.000" end="00:41:13.420" style="s2">attention it&#39;s gonna be hard for us to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.890" end="00:41:15.820" style="s2">actually sustain the focus to have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.420" end="00:41:17.770" style="s2">complex enough relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.820" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">symbol and the accompanying kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.770" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">semantic web to get to get drawn in and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:25.330" style="s2">to get empowered I am yeah so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.670" style="s2">that&#39;s key and that&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.330" end="00:41:29.430" style="s2">meditation it&#39;s about long-form books</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.670" end="00:41:31.109" style="s2">and other things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.430" end="00:41:34.050" style="s2">defragment the attention and allow you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.109" end="00:41:37.050" style="s2">to what you just read for two hours</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.050" end="00:41:39.630" style="s2">almost straight now you&#39;re so deep in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.050" end="00:41:42.599" style="s2">the language that when it starts to move</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.630" end="00:41:45.300" style="s2">with symbolism you can actually get the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.599" end="00:41:48.410" style="s2">full range of connotations that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:51.420" style="s2">implied instead of the soundbite like</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.410" end="00:41:53.460" style="s2">tweet version right and anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.420" end="00:41:55.770" style="s2">a soundbite tweet of anything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.460" end="00:41:59.160" style="s2">gonna end up having that&#39;s symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.770" end="00:42:01.170" style="s2">depth and richness that is necessary so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.160" end="00:42:03.450" style="s2">so that&#39;s another component I think in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.170" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">terms of the kind of pedagogical look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.450" end="00:42:12.329" style="s2">just how can we do this and make people</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:13.619" style="s2">more susceptible to head to these</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.329" end="00:42:14.900" style="s2">resources that they were that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.619" end="00:42:17.790" style="s2">become available</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.900" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">just just one thing I&#39;d like to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.790" end="00:42:24.119" style="s2">add to that it seems to me that in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:25.829" style="s2">present crisis that we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.119" end="00:42:30.059" style="s2">and also just to bring it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.829" end="00:42:31.859" style="s2">crisis our reaction to the crisis sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.059" end="00:42:34.650" style="s2">of depends on how deeply we&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.859" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">these these things or how deeply we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.650" end="00:42:40.650" style="s2">studied life and if we&#39;ve studied them</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:43.530" style="s2">deeply we know that there&#39;s a crisis all</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.650" end="00:42:46.559" style="s2">the time right this is not this is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.530" end="00:42:48.630" style="s2">exceptional crisis in one sense but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.559" end="00:42:50.099" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re all going to die is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.630" end="00:42:52.589" style="s2">like that&#39;s like the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.099" end="00:42:55.950" style="s2">learn right and if you study any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.589" end="00:42:57.869" style="s2">religious tradition is to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.950" end="00:43:00.299" style="s2">the fact that there&#39;s a crisis going off</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.869" end="00:43:01.790" style="s2">all the time just by virtue of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.299" end="00:43:04.740" style="s2">that we have bodies that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.790" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">disintegrating and we have to live that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.740" end="00:43:13.440" style="s2">tragedy yeah I think that&#39;s right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.030" style="s2">I think I think it was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.440" end="00:43:19.020" style="s2">talking with Peter Lindbergh in his</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.030" end="00:43:20.970" style="s2">online stoah about and I want to connect</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.020" end="00:43:22.920" style="s2">this to Zac&#39;s point about long-form</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.970" end="00:43:23.640" style="s2">attention because I think dia logos and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.920" end="00:43:26.250" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.640" end="00:43:29.670" style="s2">is also a great exemplification of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.250" end="00:43:33.150" style="s2">long-form attention that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.670" end="00:43:35.369" style="s2">enmeshed with trying to draw forth you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.150" end="00:43:36.809" style="s2">know a new fountain intelligibility from</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.369" end="00:43:39.030" style="s2">all of these hidden semantic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.809" end="00:43:40.619" style="s2">conceptual resources so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.030" end="00:43:43.079" style="s2">why idea the logos is actually crucial</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.619" end="00:43:45.269" style="s2">and neo Lagos is not just</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.079" end="00:43:47.880" style="s2">presentation of idea the Ilocos is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.269" end="00:43:50.190" style="s2">exemplification a Zac set all the way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.880" end="00:43:51.989" style="s2">life and how it is actually viable for</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.190" end="00:43:54.950" style="s2">people being enacted right here right</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.989" end="00:43:58.759" style="s2">now I think what I wanted to say about</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.950" end="00:44:02.219" style="s2">you the point you made Andrew is</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.759" end="00:44:06.420" style="s2">connected to this long-form practice you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.219" end="00:44:08.369" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s um so stoicism one way</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.420" end="00:44:11.190" style="s2">Visser does this and Beyond faith you</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.369" end="00:44:13.109" style="s2">know that our word fatal which we attack</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.190" end="00:44:15.450" style="s2">we know Ian elevate with causing death</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.109" end="00:44:17.759" style="s2">that&#39;s not its origin his origin is</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.450" end="00:44:20.309" style="s2">having to do with fate which is the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.759" end="00:44:23.009" style="s2">in which reality acts beyond all of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.309" end="00:44:24.809" style="s2">ego centric projects and concerns in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.009" end="00:44:26.999" style="s2">way which we can be struck by absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.809" end="00:44:29.459" style="s2">or tragedy there&#39;s many different ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.999" end="00:44:30.299" style="s2">in which reality hits us in the face and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.459" end="00:44:31.799" style="s2">says aha</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.299" end="00:44:33.930" style="s2">you have all your projects and all your</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.799" end="00:44:37.259" style="s2">narcissistic narrative but look</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.930" end="00:44:39.660" style="s2">Here I am right and so yeah they&#39;re why</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.259" end="00:44:41.880" style="s2">the associate became so strong right is</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.660" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">of course the event of death is the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.880" end="00:44:46.979" style="s2">in that sense fatal it&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:48.809" style="s2">makes us most aware of how reality is</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.979" end="00:44:50.789" style="s2">involved and beyond us but then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.809" end="00:44:52.920" style="s2">point is not and I think this is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.789" end="00:44:56.219" style="s2">you&#39;re saying Andrew the point is not to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.920" end="00:44:57.779" style="s2">be considerate just considerate of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.219" end="00:45:00.029" style="s2">the fact that our existence will</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.779" end="00:45:02.219" style="s2">terminate it&#39;s that right here right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.029" end="00:45:04.799" style="s2">we are meshed in fatality and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.219" end="00:45:08.279" style="s2">mortality of all things because always</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.799" end="00:45:11.609" style="s2">always everything is threatening us in</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.279" end="00:45:13.529" style="s2">the way that it is always beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.609" end="00:45:15.989" style="s2">narrative and are narcissistic narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.529" end="00:45:17.999" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had a we&#39;ve we&#39;re going into a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.989" end="00:45:19.799" style="s2">culture that is doubling down and trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.999" end="00:45:22.049" style="s2">to sort of no no no no I can just make</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.799" end="00:45:23.699" style="s2">it so I can just make it so by speaking</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.049" end="00:45:26.910" style="s2">it more loudly and getting other people</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.699" end="00:45:29.400" style="s2">to shout it with me and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.910" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">against us means us back again and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.400" end="00:45:33.719" style="s2">not trying to like Dragoon something but</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:38.190" style="s2">I think that&#39;s again this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.719" end="00:45:41.160" style="s2">sacredness of sacredness is to be at</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.190" end="00:45:43.079" style="s2">home with right at home with your</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.160" end="00:45:46.589" style="s2">mortality and the fatality of all things</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.079" end="00:45:48.599" style="s2">well never denying it&#39;s real horror the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.589" end="00:45:52.229" style="s2">fact that it can always it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.599" end="00:45:56.040" style="s2">every moment capable of showing you an</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.229" end="00:45:57.690" style="s2">absurdity or in horror</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.040" end="00:46:00.510" style="s2">or in what&#39;s happened you know in terror</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.690" end="00:46:03.800" style="s2">or in all kinds of things that reality</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.510" end="00:46:07.770" style="s2">is something that is always always</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.800" end="00:46:09.540" style="s2">always and you know not always just in</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.770" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">the long term but always always here and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.540" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">now beyond us in very very powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:18.330" style="s2">and so stoicism was a lot about trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:20.610" style="s2">to we order yet and right and and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.330" end="00:46:21.780" style="s2">think socialism as a clear example comes</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.610" end="00:46:23.430" style="s2">out of the Socratic tradition very</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.780" end="00:46:27.360" style="s2">clearly in which people were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.430" end="00:46:27.960" style="s2">Wed Socratic rationality with this kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.360" end="00:46:30.210" style="s2">of faith</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.960" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">stoicism has been called a religion and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.210" end="00:46:34.680" style="s2">I think not unfairly because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.930" style="s2">in which you tried to get people right a</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.680" end="00:46:39.660" style="s2">new sense of the sacred that allowed</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.930" end="00:46:43.320" style="s2">them right to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.660" end="00:46:44.700" style="s2">moment-by-moment fatality of all things</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.320" end="00:46:46.200" style="s2">I think the good is amiss probably do</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.700" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">something very similar which is why</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.200" end="00:46:51.210" style="s2">there&#39;s often comparisons drawn between</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:53.310" style="s2">stoicism and Buddhism by the way so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.210" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s really really important what</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.310" end="00:46:58.770" style="s2">Andrew just said and connect it to what</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.890" end="00:46:59.820" style="s2">Zacks said and I think what connects</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.770" end="00:47:03.300" style="s2">them is this whole thing we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.820" end="00:47:06.120" style="s2">talking about this this sense this lived</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.300" end="00:47:12.150" style="s2">viable aspirational sense of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.120" end="00:47:15.240" style="s2">right here right now great and just</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.150" end="00:47:17.160" style="s2">maybe after we&#39;ve said all that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.240" end="00:47:20.300" style="s2">talked about that this is being the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.160" end="00:47:23.840" style="s2">state that we&#39;re in or all the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.300" end="00:47:26.700" style="s2">maybe I want maybe we could move to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.840" end="00:47:28.500" style="s2">speak about what you called you call</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.700" end="00:47:30.990" style="s2">something great on patterning or</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.500" end="00:47:35.640" style="s2">transition or what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.990" end="00:47:36.600" style="s2">now and I don&#39;t mean about the virus in</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.640" end="00:47:39.780" style="s2">any literal sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:42.320" style="s2">I mean what&#39;s what&#39;s I mean yes literal</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.780" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">because it is a literal thing but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.320" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">what&#39;s going on now what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:51.270" style="s2">time because you talk about historicity</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:54.050" style="s2">I think Zack and and and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.270" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">of that and the importance of time and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.050" end="00:48:03.860" style="s2">is my question clear it is and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:03.860" style="s2">mean fate is unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.030" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re in kind of sacred Kairos right</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.089" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">where reality is where reality is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:18.140" style="s2">appearing kind of again as it were</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:19.849" style="s2">because of our the deep simulations that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.140" end="00:48:22.550" style="s2">were produced by the civilization as it</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.849" end="00:48:24.829" style="s2">was moving through where we thought that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.550" end="00:48:26.869" style="s2">we didn&#39;t need to have massive supplies</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.829" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">back loaded in hospitals just in case</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.869" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">there was a Mike we didn&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:34.510" style="s2">through right because we were deep in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:38.470" style="s2">simulation and everything was fine and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.510" end="00:48:41.930" style="s2">so now yeah we are confronting reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.470" end="00:48:44.930" style="s2">and so the question is yeah will we will</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.930" end="00:48:49.609" style="s2">we pull together like Stoics and love</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.930" end="00:48:52.460" style="s2">fate and end up in crazy and and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.609" end="00:48:55.579" style="s2">moving with our identities to become to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.460" end="00:48:59.000" style="s2">become one with the tragic situation</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.579" end="00:49:02.599" style="s2">then transform it somehow from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.000" end="00:49:05.690" style="s2">inside in response to it and so that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.599" end="00:49:07.070" style="s2">see mostly what&#39;s unfolding now and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.690" end="00:49:08.780" style="s2">that&#39;s why I talked about a war in</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.070" end="00:49:12.290" style="s2">heaven is that Jude&#39;s choice it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.780" end="00:49:16.010" style="s2">the basis of choice and who are we</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.290" end="00:49:19.130" style="s2">choosing to be and so that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.010" end="00:49:22.849" style="s2">conflict between these ideals we have of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.130" end="00:49:27.410" style="s2">ourselves right are we stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.849" end="00:49:29.240" style="s2">that so what is the war of heaven</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.410" end="00:49:33.650" style="s2">between who and who is it between the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.240" end="00:49:35.660" style="s2">knee list and let&#39;s say the the life</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.650" end="00:49:38.060" style="s2">hater and the life giver I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.660" end="00:49:39.740" style="s2">what is the war what is it&#39;s me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.060" end="00:49:41.240" style="s2">Matt it&#39;s massively complicated right</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.740" end="00:49:43.910" style="s2">you remember last time we spoke it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.240" end="00:49:45.890" style="s2">this sense of the divine double and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.910" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">we kind of brought home one and the room</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.890" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">was like no it&#39;s actually there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:52.550" style="s2">of those potential selves that are in</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:55.099" style="s2">your arc typical imagination to move</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.550" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">towards us like personal ideals yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.099" end="00:49:57.980" style="s2">so what&#39;s happened now with the great on</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">patterning is that everyone&#39;s sitting at</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.980" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">home with a lot of time were an absence</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:07.160" style="s2">of time so a fragmentation of conti the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.910" end="00:50:09.050" style="s2">way you&#39;re hanging out with many many of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.160" end="00:50:09.770" style="s2">yourselves who usually don&#39;t get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.050" end="00:50:11.240" style="s2">of airtime</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.770" end="00:50:12.710" style="s2">right so there&#39;s many of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.240" end="00:50:14.220" style="s2">archetypal personalities and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.710" end="00:50:16.860" style="s2">possibilities for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.220" end="00:50:19.620" style="s2">are now flooding the imagination into</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.860" end="00:50:21.780" style="s2">this opening from being unpadded and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.620" end="00:50:23.970" style="s2">it happens when you travel it happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.780" end="00:50:26.100" style="s2">other times in your day-to-day life when</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.970" end="00:50:27.390" style="s2">something like if you went for an</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.100" end="00:50:28.890" style="s2">appointment that didn&#39;t happen and now</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.390" end="00:50:30.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like an hour to just sit</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.890" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">there and you don&#39;t have your phone or</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.120" end="00:50:33.390" style="s2">something like what happened your</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:33.810" style="s2">imagination goes unless you&#39;re a Penn</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.390" end="00:50:36.390" style="s2">Stater</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.810" end="00:50:38.700" style="s2">right like so there&#39;s the war in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.390" end="00:50:41.460" style="s2">is that it&#39;s this is a universal version</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.700" end="00:50:44.460" style="s2">of that of like being in the doctor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.460" end="00:50:46.280" style="s2">office you know waiting for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.460" end="00:50:49.170" style="s2">appointment and then what happens right</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.280" end="00:50:50.520" style="s2">right and what happens in the doctor day</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.170" end="00:50:52.380" style="s2">we&#39;re waiting for the appointment in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.520" end="00:50:54.570" style="s2">doctor&#39;s office were nervous there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.380" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">good magazines we&#39;re sitting there and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.570" end="00:50:58.590" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these different possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.640" end="00:51:01.020" style="s2">cells that were thinking about them</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.590" end="00:51:03.780" style="s2">because the way the world will be on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.020" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">other side of this is also unclear it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.780" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">means that we&#39;re getting in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">all of all ourselves the full range</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:14.190" style="s2">right shadow and light if I can use that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:16.620" style="s2">kind of polarization so it&#39;s not a war</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.190" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">between two forces it&#39;s a war between</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.620" end="00:51:20.580" style="s2">the many potent possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:23.340" style="s2">ourselves that we&#39;re going to actualize</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.580" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">through really unique moments of choice</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.340" end="00:51:29.700" style="s2">in the coming months right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:35.730" style="s2">about that so who do we choose to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.700" end="00:51:37.290" style="s2">when we make a choice and and so again</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.730" end="00:51:39.600" style="s2">it means we have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.290" end="00:51:41.460" style="s2">become incredible people right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.600" end="00:51:45.300" style="s2">one possibility we have the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.460" end="00:51:48.150" style="s2">to be integral and to act with character</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.300" end="00:51:50.190" style="s2">and integrity and to know the principles</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.150" end="00:51:53.850" style="s2">that we want to live by and to live by</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.190" end="00:51:57.390" style="s2">them more so now than ever because you</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.850" end="00:51:59.250" style="s2">know rehearsals over these on time and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.390" end="00:52:01.740" style="s2">we have space are they yeah these are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.250" end="00:52:04.620" style="s2">the important choices so we have that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.740" end="00:52:07.140" style="s2">possibility which is rare actually to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.620" end="00:52:09.540" style="s2">in a moment of historical gravitas where</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.140" end="00:52:12.840" style="s2">you have the chance to be doing really</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.540" end="00:52:16.070" style="s2">the right thing so but we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.840" end="00:52:20.390" style="s2">opportunity to descend into</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.070" end="00:52:23.119" style="s2">and through fragmentation of choice and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.390" end="00:52:25.730" style="s2">being many different people not holding</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.119" end="00:52:28.490" style="s2">together with integrity and catering to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.730" end="00:52:31.670" style="s2">those voices that are most selfish and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.490" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">most fear driven etc so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.670" end="00:52:37.220" style="s2">balance that battlin our personalities</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.869" style="s2">basically as we&#39;re faced with decisions</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.220" end="00:52:42.440" style="s2">we never thought we&#39;d have to make in</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.869" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">choices goods is that we never even kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.440" end="00:52:47.560" style="s2">of thought were on the table or now on</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:51.530" style="s2">the table</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.560" end="00:52:53.720" style="s2">so so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of how you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.530" end="00:52:56.450" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of how I&#39;m feeling it so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.720" end="00:52:59.600" style="s2">title of Tillich&#39;s book the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.450" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">be sort of middle mind when you say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.600" end="00:53:05.990" style="s2">when we mmm-hmm it was very clear about</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">is that required a transformation right</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.990" end="00:53:09.410" style="s2">in faith and a transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:11.930" style="s2">notion of God you had to get to the God</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.410" end="00:53:15.200" style="s2">beyond the God of theism we had to let</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.930" end="00:53:19.720" style="s2">the symbol change which is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.200" end="00:53:22.460" style="s2">I wanted to bring that you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.720" end="00:53:26.440" style="s2">ultimately you know they&#39;re part of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.460" end="00:53:31.010" style="s2">this means is is a participatory stance</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.440" end="00:53:33.290" style="s2">not not neither you know you know a sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.010" end="00:53:35.270" style="s2">of passive stance or an assertive stance</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.290" end="00:53:37.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a participatory stance we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.270" end="00:53:40.280" style="s2">participate in this because we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.790" end="00:53:42.020" style="s2">be willing to let the symbols change too</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.280" end="00:53:44.630" style="s2">and I think that was a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.020" end="00:53:48.440" style="s2">message and and faith isn&#39;t the holding</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.630" end="00:53:51.100" style="s2">on of to the existing symbol for Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.440" end="00:53:55.100" style="s2">and it&#39;s certain and it&#39;s not any</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.100" end="00:53:56.150" style="s2">premature closure right oh now I have it</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.100" end="00:54:01.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.150" end="00:54:04.730" style="s2">it&#39;s instead but it&#39;s the vector off the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.960" end="00:54:06.890" style="s2">Hebrew word right it&#39;s like the way you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.730" end="00:54:10.550" style="s2">have the way you&#39;re faithful to your</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.890" end="00:54:12.440" style="s2">partner is not hold her that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.550" end="00:54:14.300" style="s2">straight so I&#39;m just using myself as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.440" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">example but to hold her now you always</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.300" end="00:54:18.920" style="s2">have to be this way or you know this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">here&#39;s a particular symbol I&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.920" end="00:54:23.150" style="s2">for a relationship and you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">up for negotiation that&#39;s it like no</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.150" end="00:54:27.050" style="s2">that&#39;s not what it means it means you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.650" end="00:54:29.580" style="s2">have to be willing to be involved and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.050" end="00:54:31.860" style="s2">let yourself change as the symbol change</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.580" end="00:54:33.630" style="s2">so that you made it make maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.860" end="00:54:35.580" style="s2">continuity of contact about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.630" end="00:54:37.140" style="s2">and that brings me up to a concern with</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.580" end="00:54:38.790" style="s2">what not with what Zack said because I</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.140" end="00:54:40.500" style="s2">think what he said but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.790" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">an extra dimension to the war in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.500" end="00:54:45.210" style="s2">and you know Chris and I our work are</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:47.550" style="s2">thinking about this and this also goes</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.210" end="00:54:49.310" style="s2">to work that your your your harness is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.550" end="00:54:52.110" style="s2">talking about need hauser</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.310" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">the fact that many people when they and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.110" end="00:54:55.830" style="s2">Hahn talks about this too right when</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:59.580" style="s2">people are throwing into this empty time</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.830" end="00:55:01.620" style="s2">right they have and I&#39;m trying not to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.580" end="00:55:03.420" style="s2">insulting here but this is sort of a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.620" end="00:55:06.660" style="s2">of getting the gist of they have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.420" end="00:55:08.940" style="s2">of shallowness in imagination if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.660" end="00:55:10.650" style="s2">allow me to use Corbin&#39;s idea they have</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.940" end="00:55:12.780" style="s2">a merely imaginary sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.650" end="00:55:15.810" style="s2">imagination not an imaginal they have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.780" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">purely subjective sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.810" end="00:55:20.790" style="s2">imagination not a trans jacket one and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:23.220" style="s2">therefore it cuts them off in the very</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.790" end="00:55:26.280" style="s2">way they have been in cultured to deal</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.220" end="00:55:28.620" style="s2">with their imagination right it cuts</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.280" end="00:55:31.080" style="s2">them off from the aspirational project</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.620" end="00:55:33.960" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about here and so my</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.080" end="00:55:37.650" style="s2">concern is that they you know are sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.960" end="00:55:40.560" style="s2">of Cartesian the subjectivity is being</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.650" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">challenged really dramatically here but</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.560" end="00:55:46.830" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned that people in order to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:49.050" style="s2">let the symbol in order to grow with the</p>

<p begin="00:57:46.850" end="00:57:53.120" style="s2">strengthens Zach&#39;s point yeah radical</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.420" end="00:57:55.370" style="s2">right transformation is needed to our</p>

<p begin="00:57:55.370" end="00:57:58.550" style="s2">it&#39;s the line between education and an</p>

<p begin="00:57:58.550" end="00:58:03.110" style="s2">blurred it seems to me and what zach is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.920" end="00:58:06.050" style="s2">proposing and we&#39;ve got to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.110" end="00:58:08.600" style="s2">that unique powerful way you know just</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.050" end="00:58:11.360" style="s2">before Zach you respond I I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.600" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">about the fact that when you paint that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.360" end="00:58:17.510" style="s2">picture John it looks very very grim but</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">at the same time at the same time it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.510" end="00:58:23.000" style="s2">grim and it is a grim picture at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:26.020" style="s2">same time maybe a few individuals doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.000" end="00:58:30.620" style="s2">this properly can go a long way right</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.020" end="00:58:32.840" style="s2">and so I think of it again I think in</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.620" end="00:58:35.120" style="s2">the biblical Ark story are like building</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.840" end="00:58:37.940" style="s2">an ark or just you know building the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.120" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">thing doing the thing properly now just</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.940" end="00:58:44.210" style="s2">a few people can can save save the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:46.730" style="s2">if I can be as she&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.210" end="00:58:48.050" style="s2">no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not cheesy I never</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.730" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">understood the etymology of that insult</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.050" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">I love cheese ever Fred&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.610" end="00:59:02.340" style="s2">and the happens and he&#39;s the gadfly for</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.310" end="00:59:04.290" style="s2">the entire place right and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.340" end="00:59:06.750" style="s2">all these movements start up around him</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.290" end="00:59:08.520" style="s2">and all the socratic low guy you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.750" end="00:59:10.950" style="s2">the all that you wish it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.520" end="00:59:12.240" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.950" end="00:59:13.530" style="s2">Leonard Cohen II it&#39;s like he sank</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.240" end="00:59:15.720" style="s2">beneath your wisdom like a stone</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.530" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">although he was Jesus but all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.720" end="00:59:20.670" style="s2">ripples just spread out in like and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:24.210" style="s2">was deeply deep and eventually it leads</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.670" end="00:59:29.550" style="s2">to stoicism and Marcus Aurelius right we</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.210" end="00:59:31.110" style="s2">I yes I do want to sorry exactly bending</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.550" end="00:59:32.430" style="s2">you from speaking but I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.110" end="00:59:34.560" style="s2">pick up on although I&#39;m painting a grim</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.430" end="00:59:37.470" style="s2">picture I keep holding out the these</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.560" end="00:59:40.830" style="s2">exemplary figures and how in situations</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.470" end="00:59:44.820" style="s2">very very similar to ours they were able</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.830" end="00:59:47.640" style="s2">to enact and afford that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.820" end="00:59:50.010" style="s2">educational enculturation &#39;el reform</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.640" end="00:59:51.750" style="s2">that zach has pointed to so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.010" end="00:59:54.930" style="s2">is not in an event it&#39;s this is not an</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.750" end="00:59:56.820" style="s2">inevitable witness of doom or grimness</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.930" end="00:59:58.410" style="s2">of inevitable doom that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.820" end="01:00:00.390" style="s2">arguing for at all I&#39;m arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.410" end="01:00:02.250" style="s2">taking it very seriously but pointing</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.390" end="01:00:06.500" style="s2">out there&#39;s real historical examples of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.250" end="01:00:09.630" style="s2">ways in which this can be seen through</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.500" end="01:00:12.180" style="s2">right I think you know and I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.630" end="01:00:14.490" style="s2">completely agree of course that that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.180" end="01:00:16.980" style="s2">route here is something like education</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.490" end="01:00:18.840" style="s2">extremely broadly construed or there the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.980" end="01:00:20.430" style="s2">word idea which is the work I use in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.840" end="01:00:22.050" style="s2">book which is a word that basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.430" end="01:00:24.090" style="s2">roughly means like the intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.050" end="01:00:29.340" style="s2">transmission that keeps a polity</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.090" end="01:00:30.290" style="s2">together yeah so and that is sorely</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.340" end="01:00:32.820" style="s2">lacking</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.290" end="01:00:35.100" style="s2">thanks to like the exhaustion of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.820" end="01:00:36.930" style="s2">modern school systems and now those</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.100" end="01:00:39.750" style="s2">school systems have been shut off</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.930" end="01:00:43.590" style="s2">basically all around the world and all</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.750" end="01:00:46.010" style="s2">the kids are at home and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.590" end="01:00:50.520" style="s2">really an unprecedented situation</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.010" end="01:00:53.400" style="s2">educationally and you know the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.520" end="01:00:55.500" style="s2">of in what ways after this could we</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.400" end="01:00:58.500" style="s2">change education so that a situation</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.500" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">like this doesn&#39;t occur again is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.500" end="01:01:04.500" style="s2">question that I&#39;m asking because so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.200" end="01:01:07.200" style="s2">of the situation with kind of breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.500" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">of anything like a public sphere and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.200" end="01:01:11.190" style="s2">kind of polarization</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:14.760" style="s2">post truth culture and much of this also</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.190" end="01:01:20.070" style="s2">rooted in the educational crisis broadly</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.760" end="01:01:22.560" style="s2">construed so yeah and enculturation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.070" end="01:01:24.660" style="s2">schooling were basically separated and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.560" end="01:01:25.350" style="s2">then we forgot to work on inculturation</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.660" end="01:01:27.690" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.350" end="01:01:30.050" style="s2">and we taught kids a bunch of technical</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.690" end="01:01:32.610" style="s2">skills to try to prepare them for jobs</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.050" end="01:01:34.440" style="s2">early in modernity that was okay because</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.610" end="01:01:36.360" style="s2">the churches were still going and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.440" end="01:01:38.310" style="s2">convenience were still going and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.360" end="01:01:40.080" style="s2">system hadn&#39;t basically colonized the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.310" end="01:01:41.790" style="s2">life world to the extent that the dinner</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.080" end="01:01:45.540" style="s2">table wasn&#39;t a place of acculturation</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.790" end="01:01:47.340" style="s2">anymore but separating those having</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.540" end="01:01:49.050" style="s2">schooling going strong getting lots of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.340" end="01:01:50.460" style="s2">really technically capacitated people</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.050" end="01:01:52.380" style="s2">through a school system up into some</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.460" end="01:01:55.980" style="s2">extensive meritocracy right and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.380" end="01:01:58.140" style="s2">alongside that lack of rich character</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.980" end="01:02:00.810" style="s2">building inculturation own processes</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.140" end="01:02:03.990" style="s2">right instead something like popular</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.810" end="01:02:07.920" style="s2">culture and consumerism being the main</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.990" end="01:02:09.450" style="s2">modality of toleration and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a nightmare and that&#39;s produced</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.450" end="01:02:17.160" style="s2">the generations now that are in power</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:19.260" style="s2">and aspiring to power so yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.160" end="01:02:22.680" style="s2">all of these cascades systematically</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.260" end="01:02:24.660" style="s2">from educational failures and not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.680" end="01:02:27.300" style="s2">failures of school and like TV could</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.660" end="01:02:28.440" style="s2">have been different if you read the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.300" end="01:02:31.560" style="s2">early literature in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.440" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">Education when TV was coming out people</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.560" end="01:02:35.340" style="s2">were talking about the way we were</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:37.590" style="s2">talking about the internet in like 1995</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.340" end="01:02:39.480" style="s2">or 2000 this is the thing that will save</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.590" end="01:02:41.310" style="s2">democracy television will do that and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.480" end="01:02:42.360" style="s2">like didn&#39;t pan out that way for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.310" end="01:02:45.780" style="s2">number of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.360" end="01:02:47.190" style="s2">so we failed across the board in using</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.780" end="01:02:49.380" style="s2">the infrastructures and that end</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.190" end="01:02:52.260" style="s2">technology is we had to make the Padilla</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.380" end="01:02:54.990" style="s2">strong enough to support the polity and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.260" end="01:02:57.330" style="s2">so the polity is in crisis and were</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.990" end="01:03:00.150" style="s2">realizing the paucity of the pedido</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.330" end="01:03:02.610" style="s2">which means we&#39;re I&#39;m realizing the that</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.150" end="01:03:07.620" style="s2">fourfold educational crisis I broke down</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.610" end="01:03:11.790" style="s2">last time is unfolding so my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.620" end="01:03:14.370" style="s2">that if we move quickly we could in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.790" end="01:03:17.190" style="s2">generation start to change things but it</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.370" end="01:03:18.990" style="s2">would require some of the social</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.190" end="01:03:20.280" style="s2">miracles I&#39;ll I have in my book which</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.990" end="01:03:21.420" style="s2">are on the table now things like basic</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.280" end="01:03:24.450" style="s2">income guarantee</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.420" end="01:03:26.579" style="s2">and adult education right where that</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.450" end="01:03:28.109" style="s2">where we could get a whole group of</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.579" end="01:03:30.869" style="s2">people actually a whole generation of</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.109" end="01:03:33.569" style="s2">like food service workers basically who</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.869" end="01:03:35.309" style="s2">may or may not have jobs to return to we</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.569" end="01:03:40.670" style="s2">could get them into position to become</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.309" end="01:03:43.170" style="s2">more like teachers or community guides</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.670" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">working in a decentralized educational</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.170" end="01:03:48.260" style="s2">system as opposed to returning them to</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:51.869" style="s2">their jobs right but if we just try to</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.260" end="01:03:54.690" style="s2">reboot the schools as we knew them and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.869" end="01:03:56.819" style="s2">kind of go back to the way it was I</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.690" end="01:03:58.859" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually a recipe for</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.819" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">deepening the mental health crisis I</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.859" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna have to basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:05.730" style="s2">address what&#39;s happening with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:08.069" style="s2">immediate reforms of schooling on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.730" end="01:04:09.990" style="s2">other side of it similar to what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.069" end="01:04:13.740" style="s2">have to do after a war transpired like</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.990" end="01:04:15.960" style="s2">yeah we&#39;d have to find a way to help the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.740" end="01:04:18.630" style="s2">help the generations make sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.960" end="01:04:21.780" style="s2">together and figure out a shared vision</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.630" end="01:04:24.210" style="s2">for what it&#39;s like moving forward and</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.780" end="01:04:25.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an educational an</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.210" end="01:04:28.410" style="s2">educational challenge it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.650" end="01:04:30.329" style="s2">more profound ones we&#39;ve faced so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.410" end="01:04:32.640" style="s2">looking at something like as different</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.329" end="01:04:34.410" style="s2">from the schools we&#39;ve had as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.640" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">schools we have are as different from</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.410" end="01:04:38.760" style="s2">the ones we had before the first world</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">wars right and that difference in</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:42.390" style="s2">America at least is profound like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:43.799" style="s2">looking at almost like one room</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.390" end="01:04:47.430" style="s2">schoolhouse stuff for most of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.799" end="01:04:49.740" style="s2">country in 1900s and then in 1950 you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.430" end="01:04:52.140" style="s2">got these huge high schools that were</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.740" end="01:04:54.750" style="s2">basically massive innovations so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.140" end="01:04:57.030" style="s2">suggesting similarly now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.750" end="01:04:58.589" style="s2">mean that much thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.030" end="01:05:00.569" style="s2">educational and psychological and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.589" end="01:05:03.530" style="s2">cultural dimensions of this as we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.569" end="01:05:06.809" style="s2">thinking about you know biometric</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.530" end="01:05:09.540" style="s2">infrastructures and economic stimulus</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.809" end="01:05:11.730" style="s2">packages and geopolitical security and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.540" end="01:05:13.140" style="s2">those things are important but if we</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.730" end="01:05:15.900" style="s2">just pretend that the culture will take</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.140" end="01:05:19.950" style="s2">care of itself and education will be</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.900" end="01:05:21.390" style="s2">fine the way it was then we&#39;ll repeat</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.950" end="01:05:24.380" style="s2">the mistake you may not be exactly</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.390" end="01:05:26.099" style="s2">identical but there will be a breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.380" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">because of the failure of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.099" end="01:05:31.349" style="s2">intergenerational transmission so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:33.960" style="s2">getting the the massive you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.349" end="01:05:34.730" style="s2">paradigm shift change in education needs</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.960" end="01:05:36.560" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.730" end="01:05:38.180" style="s2">on one hand and then the other hand the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.560" end="01:05:41.839" style="s2">image he uses that is there is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.180" end="01:05:45.140" style="s2">kitchen table or the you know so I like</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.839" end="01:05:46.760" style="s2">that I think I think getting back to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.140" end="01:05:48.829" style="s2">table and you know I know my daughter is</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.760" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">home studying and she&#39;s sitting around</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.829" end="01:05:53.930" style="s2">the table doing her school and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:57.470" style="s2">wonderful it&#39;s like she&#39;s not corralled</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.930" end="01:06:00.740" style="s2">into the into this sort of alienating</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.470" end="01:06:04.609" style="s2">classroom kind of thing and she&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.740" end="01:06:06.410" style="s2">more relaxed and just as a person person</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.609" end="01:06:08.119" style="s2">person exactly you and you guys are I</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.410" end="01:06:11.180" style="s2">think you&#39;re trying to say the local and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.119" end="01:06:13.070" style="s2">there needs to be a universal change and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.180" end="01:06:14.810" style="s2">a local change simultaneously oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.070" end="01:06:17.510" style="s2">those are related and you you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.810" end="01:06:19.160" style="s2">you&#39;re lucky like to have a table to sit</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.510" end="01:06:21.710" style="s2">around I know there&#39;s a lot of kids in</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.160" end="01:06:24.579" style="s2">the United States for whom not being</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.710" end="01:06:26.660" style="s2">able to go to school his socks yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.579" end="01:06:27.950" style="s2">parents are abusive there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.660" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">room in the house and school was</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.950" end="01:06:32.450" style="s2">actually the safe place for them mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:34.040" style="s2">so I&#39;m not like wanting to return it to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.450" end="01:06:36.010" style="s2">the family or even to the local</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.040" end="01:06:38.570" style="s2">community per se because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.010" end="01:06:39.829" style="s2">parochialism that can happen there there</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.570" end="01:06:42.710" style="s2">was something innovative about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.829" end="01:06:45.829" style="s2">universality okay so it&#39;s a hybrid and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.710" end="01:06:48.109" style="s2">again I expressed it in my book but but</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.829" end="01:06:50.720" style="s2">yeah right now for many people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.109" end="01:06:52.609" style="s2">realizing holy crap like education was</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.720" end="01:06:54.260" style="s2">taken out of the house like education</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.609" end="01:06:55.579" style="s2">was taken from us my kids are taken from</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.260" end="01:06:56.780" style="s2">me everyday like they&#39;re gonna realize</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.579" end="01:06:59.270" style="s2">that when it&#39;s going well and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.780" end="01:07:01.940" style="s2">lucky and the table can be a place where</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.270" end="01:07:04.069" style="s2">love happens in those things there may</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.940" end="01:07:08.089" style="s2">be a realization in some quarters that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.069" end="01:07:09.380" style="s2">you know wow many of those patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.089" end="01:07:10.490" style="s2">have been in place that we take for</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.380" end="01:07:14.030" style="s2">granted almost like they&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.490" end="01:07:17.410" style="s2">nature are in fact not they have been</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.030" end="01:07:22.069" style="s2">constructed and are now changing rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.410" end="01:07:23.650" style="s2">so I do see on the horizon pretty</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.069" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">radical changes in the educational</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.650" end="01:07:31.910" style="s2">possibilities yeah I do because one</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:33.890" style="s2">place where Zach&#39;s notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.910" end="01:07:36.050" style="s2">education crisis and my idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.890" end="01:07:38.119" style="s2">meeting crisis came together of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.050" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">was in when I talked about what happens</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.119" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">after the personal information you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:44.410" style="s2">the separation of the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.359" end="01:07:46.640" style="s2">institution from the wisdom institution</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.410" end="01:07:47.960" style="s2">universities get separated from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.640" end="01:07:49.570" style="s2">monasteries</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.960" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">and I was gonna say Andrew it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.570" end="01:07:54.770" style="s2">that education was taken I would have</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:56.690" style="s2">the the kitchens also taking up to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.770" end="01:07:58.250" style="s2">church I was young enough that I went to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.690" end="01:08:02.900" style="s2">actually went to Sunday school it was</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.250" end="01:08:04.310" style="s2">actually called Sunday school and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.900" end="01:08:07.070" style="s2">and you know and the problem with that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.310" end="01:08:09.170" style="s2">is Sunday school is what is was a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.070" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">degenerate version of what you know what</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.170" end="01:08:13.790" style="s2">the monasteries once were was basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">indoctrination right and once you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.790" end="01:08:18.739" style="s2">the child sort of to memorize the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:20.420" style="s2">doctrines but even there you saw that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.739" end="01:08:22.759" style="s2">for some people into something and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.420" end="01:08:26.020" style="s2">thinking what the monasteries have been</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.759" end="01:08:29.180" style="s2">and how they are in other cultures like</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.020" end="01:08:35.060" style="s2">you know the Buddhist monastery is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.180" end="01:08:36.770" style="s2">separate in the way that it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.060" end="01:08:38.509" style="s2">separated from the knowledge institution</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.770" end="01:08:41.000" style="s2">disagreed it is for example in the West</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.509" end="01:08:45.940" style="s2">or something like that so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.000" end="01:08:52.250" style="s2">trying to get at again is this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.940" end="01:08:53.719" style="s2">we not only need to change the but I</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.250" end="01:08:55.790" style="s2">think this is part of what Zak is saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.719" end="01:08:57.859" style="s2">too so I don&#39;t want to say sound like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.790" end="01:09:00.140" style="s2">I&#39;m saying something original here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.859" end="01:09:02.089" style="s2">not just that like will be more</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.140" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">decentralized and will be more at home</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.089" end="01:09:07.130" style="s2">right but it&#39;s also that we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:09.140" style="s2">educating not just for knowledge we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.130" end="01:09:11.650" style="s2">to be educating from wisdom and those</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.140" end="01:09:15.710" style="s2">who have to be talking to each other and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.650" end="01:09:18.170" style="s2">meshed up together it&#39;s you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.710" end="01:09:19.250" style="s2">of educational theory you actually the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.170" end="01:09:22.609" style="s2">good educational theory because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.250" end="01:09:24.739" style="s2">a lot of crap in educational theory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.609" end="01:09:26.900" style="s2">it&#39;s untethered from good cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.739" end="01:09:28.609" style="s2">science good psychology it&#39;s overly</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.900" end="01:09:30.980" style="s2">politicized it&#39;s ideologically driven</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.609" end="01:09:34.190" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of some time where I</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.980" end="01:09:35.779" style="s2">can see viable stuff is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.190" end="01:09:38.330" style="s2">sort of core notion is sort of as simple</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.779" end="01:09:41.540" style="s2">to say you know if you start if you if</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.330" end="01:09:44.359" style="s2">you give you if you begin the early age</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.540" end="01:09:47.900" style="s2">project of helping to educate character</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.359" end="01:09:51.770" style="s2">and wisdom kids will then be able to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.900" end="01:09:54.109" style="s2">take in deep kinds of complex knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.770" end="01:09:56.420" style="s2">but if you just try to give them the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.109" end="01:09:59.540" style="s2">knowledge without feeding that human</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.420" end="01:10:01.550" style="s2">need for character development and for</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.540" end="01:10:03.410" style="s2">wisdom you&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.550" end="01:10:05.570" style="s2">many many people find that very</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.410" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">educationally challenging and they</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.570" end="01:10:10.160" style="s2">ultimately develop a hostile attitude</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.230" style="s2">towards their education in their</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.160" end="01:10:14.120" style="s2">educational background and so not only</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.230" end="01:10:16.850" style="s2">do I think we need to do it culturally</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.120" end="01:10:18.850" style="s2">we need to bring back the education of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.850" end="01:10:22.010" style="s2">wisdom with the education of knowledge I</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.850" end="01:10:25.580" style="s2">think for a good pedagogical reasons we</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.010" end="01:10:28.160" style="s2">need to give that&#39;s very very C deep</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.580" end="01:10:29.960" style="s2">thinking but I don&#39;t want that to be the</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.160" end="01:10:31.430" style="s2">state version of Sunday School where we</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.960" end="01:10:33.260" style="s2">just indoctrinate people in whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.430" end="01:10:36.410" style="s2">political ideology seems to be in</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.260" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">fashion right now so the difficulty I</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.410" end="01:10:43.810" style="s2">suppose I&#39;m trying to bring out because</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.860" style="s2">I think I want to hear exactly to say is</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.810" end="01:10:48.860" style="s2">because this points towards another</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.860" end="01:10:51.230" style="s2">important point I keep all my questions</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.860" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">in probative because Zack talks about</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.230" end="01:10:57.170" style="s2">this convergence right and to me the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:59.030" style="s2">convergence is I think the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.170" end="01:11:00.440" style="s2">the response of a response a deep</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.030" end="01:11:03.020" style="s2">response to the question there and ask</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.440" end="01:11:07.070" style="s2">how do we bring back the education of</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.020" end="01:11:10.610" style="s2">wisdom within a pluralistic right</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.070" end="01:11:13.250" style="s2">framework right exactly cuz it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.610" end="01:11:20.630" style="s2">world now it&#39;s not a bunch of countries</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.250" end="01:11:23.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not Christian Europe or world no no</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.630" end="01:11:25.670" style="s2">I saw back pointing towards that when he</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.720" end="01:11:28.310" style="s2">when he was flagging the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.670" end="01:11:30.830" style="s2">its convergence between these various</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.310" end="01:11:32.720" style="s2">traditions which is not assimilating one</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.830" end="01:11:35.420" style="s2">to any master like Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.720" end="01:11:39.170" style="s2">conquering the other ones but of some</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.420" end="01:11:42.590" style="s2">kind of like a dialogo so a convergence</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.170" end="01:11:45.500" style="s2">is possible and I&#39;m wondering if that so</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.590" end="01:11:49.010" style="s2">that struck me is here&#39;s how we could</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.500" end="01:11:52.820" style="s2">get back to the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.010" end="01:11:54.440" style="s2">within a pluralistic framework yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.820" end="01:11:55.730" style="s2">I wrote about that in your essay he</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.440" end="01:11:59.660" style="s2">wrote about a symbolic convergence</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.730" end="01:12:01.310" style="s2">between wisdom ages and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.660" end="01:12:03.570" style="s2">why I&#39;m bringing this question up yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.310" end="01:12:06.780" style="s2">no it&#39;s a very good question and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.570" end="01:12:09.570" style="s2">it&#39;s really one of the more kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.780" end="01:12:11.760" style="s2">exciting things that I think will be</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.570" end="01:12:14.130" style="s2">coming through education in the coming</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.760" end="01:12:16.230" style="s2">decade I think it has two or elsewill</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.130" end="01:12:19.020" style="s2">will come apart at the scenes because of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.230" end="01:12:20.130" style="s2">the meeting crisis being like the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.020" end="01:12:22.710" style="s2">thorn in the side of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.130" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">civilizations this is lack of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.710" end="01:12:28.440" style="s2">starting like seven years old and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:32.250" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s as I mentioned the paper a</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.440" end="01:12:35.400" style="s2">trans lineage and symbol convergence</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.250" end="01:12:36.810" style="s2">across religious traditions and we spoke</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.400" end="01:12:40.470" style="s2">about last time something can neo</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.810" end="01:12:44.610" style="s2">perennialism like a distilling of some</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.470" end="01:12:47.610" style="s2">not essential conclusions that they all</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.610" end="01:12:50.940" style="s2">supposedly have in common but a form of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.610" end="01:12:53.610" style="s2">dialogue or like you&#39;re saying LS an up</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.940" end="01:12:56.460" style="s2">ecology of practice which is to say like</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.610" end="01:12:57.000" style="s2">a classroom where we can put this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.460" end="01:12:59.640" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.000" end="01:13:01.560" style="s2">and be sure that no matter what the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.640" end="01:13:05.490" style="s2">unique way this kid interacts with these</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.560" end="01:13:07.830" style="s2">materials and this teacher that they</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.490" end="01:13:10.170" style="s2">will come for their for themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.830" end="01:13:12.870" style="s2">create a kind of wisdom synthesis you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.170" end="01:13:16.860" style="s2">know let&#39;s say by the age of 18 right</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.870" end="01:13:20.040" style="s2">and so that&#39;s not indoctrination that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.860" end="01:13:21.960" style="s2">actually you know more like a Piaget</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.040" end="01:13:24.270" style="s2">idea metaphor like a gardening like you</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.960" end="01:13:28.410" style="s2">make the resources available with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.270" end="01:13:31.050" style="s2">container available and then allow them</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.410" end="01:13:33.750" style="s2">to grow into the wisdom that&#39;s unique to</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.050" end="01:13:35.100" style="s2">them and there will be huge pockets of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.750" end="01:13:36.390" style="s2">overlap well they would just be people</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.100" end="01:13:37.950" style="s2">like hey I&#39;m signing up for that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.390" end="01:13:39.300" style="s2">Buddhism thing that was pretty awesome</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.950" end="01:13:41.370" style="s2">I haven&#39;t really found one that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.300" end="01:13:43.680" style="s2">or though both people here I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.370" end="01:13:45.690" style="s2">really actually buying any of this I get</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.680" end="01:13:47.220" style="s2">why it&#39;s important but I&#39;m actually much</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.690" end="01:13:49.020" style="s2">more interested a specific kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.220" end="01:13:50.790" style="s2">scientific problem but I have a rich</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.020" end="01:13:54.150" style="s2">humanistic understanding I have my</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.790" end="01:13:58.920" style="s2">scientific identity right so we want</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.150" end="01:14:00.720" style="s2">that possibility as well so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.920" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s very it&#39;s very you want to create</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.720" end="01:14:06.000" style="s2">a renaissance person not a person who is</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.120" end="01:14:08.489" style="s2">locked in their field correct and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.000" end="01:14:10.469" style="s2">someone who&#39;s used to working</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.489" end="01:14:13.530" style="s2">with this language and with this symbol</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.469" end="01:14:17.030" style="s2">and just working with the idea that part</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.530" end="01:14:19.710" style="s2">of being human is having a kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.030" end="01:14:21.390" style="s2">historically an ontological positioned</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.710" end="01:14:23.910" style="s2">notion of self something like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.390" end="01:14:25.710" style="s2">correct that it&#39;s like that that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.910" end="01:14:26.850" style="s2">of if you don&#39;t if you&#39;re lacking that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.710" end="01:14:28.590" style="s2">it&#39;s gifted it&#39;s very uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.850" end="01:14:30.450" style="s2">experience them here in the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.590" end="01:14:32.550" style="s2">crisis and that&#39;ll cascade into</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.450" end="01:14:36.630" style="s2">legitimacy crises and capability crisis</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.550" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">etc and so yes so this is a root of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.630" end="01:14:41.219" style="s2">even if we lay down the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:43.500" style="s2">bureaucratic kind of like technological</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.219" end="01:14:45.960" style="s2">digital decentralized classroom thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.500" end="01:14:48.420" style="s2">was all great and we didn&#39;t put this</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.960" end="01:14:51.090" style="s2">kind of content in it we could end up</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.420" end="01:14:54.120" style="s2">with something way worse we&#39;re like more</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.090" end="01:14:56.940" style="s2">efficiently educating people away from</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.120" end="01:14:59.520" style="s2">wisdom and into technocratic conformity</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.940" end="01:15:01.770" style="s2">right whereas what we need to do is like</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.520" end="01:15:05.969" style="s2">suffuse to the digital architecture with</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.770" end="01:15:07.770" style="s2">these forms of wisdom and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.969" end="01:15:09.690" style="s2">mean giving them wisdom it means making</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.770" end="01:15:12.300" style="s2">the ecosystem in which when they step</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.690" end="01:15:14.730" style="s2">into it all of a sudden they&#39;re unless</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.300" end="01:15:16.590" style="s2">they&#39;re like you know bad actors they</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.730" end="01:15:19.380" style="s2">will just by through participation that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.590" end="01:15:23.150" style="s2">will become wiser or at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.380" end="01:15:25.350" style="s2">appreciative of this wisdom discussion</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.150" end="01:15:25.530" style="s2">so yeah so thank you John for pointing</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.350" end="01:15:28.020" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.530" end="01:15:30.180" style="s2">oh you&#39;re welcome that&#39;s gonna mean we</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.020" end="01:15:33.480" style="s2">have to I mean Thomas björkman makes</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.180" end="01:15:37.770" style="s2">this point you know that we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.480" end="01:15:40.380" style="s2">we sort of defaulted to that our only</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.770" end="01:15:42.360" style="s2">Authority is the market and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.380" end="01:15:43.920" style="s2">doing it means we have to because I</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.360" end="01:15:46.080" style="s2">think the point you made earlier you</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.920" end="01:15:48.840" style="s2">know education has begun has become how</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.080" end="01:15:50.910" style="s2">to train people for you know appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.840" end="01:15:54.210" style="s2">service to them the one god that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.910" end="01:15:56.219" style="s2">still all serve which is the market I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.210" end="01:15:57.900" style="s2">not a raving Marxists and I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.219" end="01:16:00.360" style="s2">to propose the overthrow of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.900" end="01:16:03.420" style="s2">or anything like that but what I am</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.360" end="01:16:05.880" style="s2">talking about is the idea that we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.420" end="01:16:09.030" style="s2">to have and and I think part of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.880" end="01:16:11.280" style="s2">this can afford us its affording it in</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.030" end="01:16:13.469" style="s2">individuals I talk to is a realization</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.280" end="01:16:15.870" style="s2">of oh wait there&#39;s a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.469" end="01:16:19.080" style="s2">really matter to me that aren&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.870" end="01:16:21.239" style="s2">aren&#39;t coming from or aren&#39;t in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.080" end="01:16:21.980" style="s2">governance of the market and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.239" end="01:16:25.220" style="s2">normative</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.980" end="01:16:27.410" style="s2">that makes a call on me that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.220" end="01:16:30.230" style="s2">the call of the market to produce and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.410" end="01:16:31.730" style="s2">consume of Hren and not denying that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.230" end="01:16:34.489" style="s2">need to produce or consume I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.730" end="01:16:36.710" style="s2">saying but what I&#39;m saying is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.489" end="01:16:39.800" style="s2">tyranny of the market and the any and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.710" end="01:16:41.960" style="s2">and and the religious idealization of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.800" end="01:16:45.040" style="s2">I think it&#39;s something that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.960" end="01:16:47.660" style="s2">to be challenged in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.040" end="01:16:50.330" style="s2">this kind of educational reform that</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.660" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">Zack is proposing yeah and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.330" end="01:16:56.000" style="s2">why this notion of the digital campfire</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:57.560" style="s2">or whatever is is kind of coming up even</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.000" end="01:17:02.300" style="s2">though I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m in love with</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.560" end="01:17:04.610" style="s2">this term yet because it still seems</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.300" end="01:17:06.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s a disembodied experience on</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.610" end="01:17:09.400" style="s2">some level it&#39;s not a real campfire but</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.560" end="01:17:12.410" style="s2">but I also like the idea that people</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.400" end="01:17:14.780" style="s2">would want to work on this communal</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.410" end="01:17:16.190" style="s2">activity together and that might be just</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.780" end="01:17:19.520" style="s2">something that people would want to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.190" end="01:17:23.690" style="s2">right that they yeah is so different</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.520" end="01:17:26.420" style="s2">than the alienation of of the market</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.690" end="01:17:29.870" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping I</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.420" end="01:17:31.430" style="s2">mean I&#39;m sort of talking about when I</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.870" end="01:17:33.350" style="s2">was when I was at the store so he was</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.430" end="01:17:36.260" style="s2">sort of stealing the culture the way you</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.350" end="01:17:38.360" style="s2">know other kind of stole the culture</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.260" end="01:17:41.330" style="s2">from you know the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.360" end="01:17:43.010" style="s2">militaristic imperialism of antique</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.330" end="01:17:45.350" style="s2">paganism right and and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.010" end="01:17:46.430" style="s2">you know and and you know Paul Banda</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.350" end="01:17:48.800" style="s2">clay and other people have been talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.430" end="01:17:50.870" style="s2">about how we have not forgotten because</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.800" end="01:17:53.630" style="s2">it&#39;s become second nature to us how much</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.870" end="01:17:59.239" style="s2">at a cultural transformation and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.630" end="01:18:01.340" style="s2">was and so you know there is this medium</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.239" end="01:18:04.910" style="s2">outside it&#39;s not completely independent</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.340" end="01:18:08.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s largely outside of the movement</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.910" end="01:18:11.090" style="s2">of the market and that this is a place</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.300" end="01:18:14.239" style="s2">with the virtual camp firing where</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.090" end="01:18:17.090" style="s2">people are finding that the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.239" end="01:18:19.970" style="s2">making and the connection making and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.090" end="01:18:24.230" style="s2">you know and this this let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.970" end="01:18:25.989" style="s2">chaotic educational interaction is</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.230" end="01:18:30.890" style="s2">deeply deeply important to the</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.989" end="01:18:33.780" style="s2">independent of the things that they had</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.890" end="01:18:37.139" style="s2">previously filled their days with</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.780" end="01:18:40.530" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a real wakening I think of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.139" end="01:18:42.179" style="s2">a real potential for us you know because</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.530" end="01:18:43.949" style="s2">that&#39;s what originally happened you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.179" end="01:18:45.539" style="s2">it you had people meeting in small</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.949" end="01:18:47.340" style="s2">groups and they started talking to each</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.539" end="01:18:49.349" style="s2">other and then the small groups started</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.340" end="01:18:51.809" style="s2">talking to each other and you can bet</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.349" end="01:18:53.639" style="s2">this huge bottom up thing and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.809" end="01:18:56.340" style="s2">think it&#39;ll go you know smoothly like</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.639" end="01:18:58.559" style="s2">some kind of you know a wonderful home</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.340" end="01:19:00.780" style="s2">our car can&#39;t be made into a product</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.559" end="01:19:02.729" style="s2">right okay if he made into a product</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.780" end="01:19:05.699" style="s2">that I and I fully expected the way the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.729" end="01:19:08.399" style="s2">Roman Empire resisted in powerful ways</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.699" end="01:19:11.689" style="s2">this up swelling of a count of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.399" end="01:19:14.550" style="s2">countercultural movement we might get</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.689" end="01:19:16.229" style="s2">same sort of resistance especially by</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.550" end="01:19:19.019" style="s2">the people who want everything to go</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.229" end="01:19:22.050" style="s2">back to normal we might try to make it</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.019" end="01:19:23.489" style="s2">into a product right but but not only</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.050" end="01:19:26.669" style="s2">that they might try to clamp down on it</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.489" end="01:19:29.809" style="s2">they might try to ridicule it they might</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.669" end="01:19:33.079" style="s2">try to undermine it they might try to</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.809" end="01:19:36.629" style="s2">organize that and market the slogans and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.079" end="01:19:38.399" style="s2">placement for some sort of a gap or that</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.629" end="01:19:40.260" style="s2">sort of get for actually undertaking the</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.399" end="01:19:43.289" style="s2">transformation I mean there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.260" end="01:19:44.719" style="s2">kinds of things that I can see I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.289" end="01:19:47.189" style="s2">know what to call it you know a</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.719" end="01:19:49.399" style="s2">socio-economic system doing our</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.189" end="01:19:53.099" style="s2">socio-economic political system doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.399" end="01:19:54.449" style="s2">well I do think that one of the positive</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.099" end="01:19:57.419" style="s2">things that&#39;s happening right now is</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.449" end="01:20:00.479" style="s2">that people are discovering as this</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.419" end="01:20:03.329" style="s2">sounds so trite they&#39;re discovering how</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.479" end="01:20:05.309" style="s2">really important culture is mmm right</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.329" end="01:20:07.439" style="s2">really important culture is and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.309" end="01:20:08.489" style="s2">different from popular culture which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.439" end="01:20:11.099" style="s2">the part of culture that gets</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.489" end="01:20:12.719" style="s2">commodified and marketed right and how</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.099" end="01:20:14.879" style="s2">much really important remember that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.719" end="01:20:18.539" style="s2">center of culture is cultists that which</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.879" end="01:20:21.780" style="s2">is sacred right rediscovering how</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.539" end="01:20:24.780" style="s2">important culture is the really you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.780" end="01:20:27.389" style="s2">the cognitive cultural grammar is for us</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.780" end="01:20:29.369" style="s2">and I think that is the gives us the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.389" end="01:20:31.169" style="s2">potential you know that this that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.369" end="01:20:35.849" style="s2">could steal the culture in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.169" end="01:20:38.579" style="s2">we need to steal it in order to get the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.849" end="01:20:40.469" style="s2">kind of I think I can&#39;t see how you</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.579" end="01:20:41.849" style="s2">would do what Zak is proposing without</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.469" end="01:20:43.979" style="s2">doing what I&#39;m proposing at the same</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.849" end="01:20:48.199" style="s2">time and say what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.979" end="01:20:48.199" style="s2">that I love it I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.219" end="01:20:56.520" style="s2">yeah a few things come to mind you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.420" end="01:20:58.739" style="s2">one of them is yeah when when the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.520" end="01:21:02.389" style="s2">kind of slips away as it has you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.739" end="01:21:06.030" style="s2">then you&#39;re left with the baseline</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.389" end="01:21:07.610" style="s2">values and needs you know and so and</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.030" end="01:21:10.770" style="s2">then you realize as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.610" end="01:21:14.760" style="s2">talking to people long-form conversation</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.770" end="01:21:18.389" style="s2">around the campfire holy crap you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.760" end="01:21:20.310" style="s2">and and the confrontation with death has</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.389" end="01:21:22.710" style="s2">part of the realization because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.310" end="01:21:24.719" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that the normal work</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.710" end="01:21:27.449" style="s2">routines are disrupted and you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.719" end="01:21:29.219" style="s2">your normal schedule and those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.449" end="01:21:33.179" style="s2">things that&#39;s also that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.219" end="01:21:34.650" style="s2">worried about death and so on your</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.179" end="01:21:38.460" style="s2">deathbed usually you don&#39;t say stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.650" end="01:21:41.310" style="s2">like I wish I had worked more overtime</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.460" end="01:21:44.610" style="s2">you know usually you say stuff like I</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.310" end="01:21:46.290" style="s2">wish I had had more family dinners spend</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.610" end="01:21:48.179" style="s2">more time around the campfire right</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.290" end="01:21:50.340" style="s2">instead more time like a fire</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.179" end="01:21:52.380" style="s2">yeah and the campfire that the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.340" end="01:21:54.389" style="s2">the fire the hearth right yeah over</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.380" end="01:21:54.989" style="s2">estia I think that&#39;s how you say it or</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.389" end="01:21:59.780" style="s2">Hestia</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.989" end="01:22:03.590" style="s2">the Greek goddess of hearth and</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.780" end="01:22:09.090" style="s2">basically the goddess of inwardness and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.590" end="01:22:11.219" style="s2">composure composure and focus and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.090" end="01:22:13.380" style="s2">yeah there is that returning to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.219" end="01:22:20.100" style="s2">uncommon Oh fireball and realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.380" end="01:22:22.469" style="s2">it&#39;s still there and you know to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.100" end="01:22:24.060" style="s2">degree to which we get used to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.469" end="01:22:26.820" style="s2">ironic a little bit right that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.060" end="01:22:28.440" style="s2">supposed to be isolating but I&#39;ve in my</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.820" end="01:22:30.540" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve been having more calls</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.440" end="01:22:32.969" style="s2">and more conversations with a writer or</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.540" end="01:22:36.510" style="s2">with a wider range of people than I</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.969" end="01:22:39.659" style="s2">usually do and so and most of them have</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.510" end="01:22:41.100" style="s2">not been kind of work calls you know I</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.659" end="01:22:43.110" style="s2">don&#39;t really consider this even like</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.100" end="01:22:48.420" style="s2">work like what we&#39;re doing here is</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.110" end="01:22:50.790" style="s2">actually yeah culture as a culture the</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.420" end="01:22:53.760" style="s2">serious part of the serious play of</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.790" end="01:22:55.380" style="s2">culture right and which is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.760" end="01:22:57.000" style="s2">on commodify land</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.380" end="01:22:58.920" style="s2">and fundamentally bail always will be</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.000" end="01:23:00.870" style="s2">even if you just happen to make some</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.920" end="01:23:02.670" style="s2">money from it it&#39;s beside it&#39;s available</p>
