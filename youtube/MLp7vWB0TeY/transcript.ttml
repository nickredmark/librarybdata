<p begin="00:00:00.489" end="00:00:02.579" style="s2">When I started working on this problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.520" end="00:00:06.629" style="s2">Or, I guess, when when it started working on me</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.569" end="00:00:12.178" style="s2">Was probably really in the mid 80&#39;s and I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.900" end="00:00:19.770" style="s2">Suffering from two things one was a very lengthy sequence of nightmares about Nuclear destruction</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.770" end="00:00:24.299" style="s2">and they&#39;re very affecting dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.769" end="00:00:30.989" style="s2">associated with that was a sense of amazement that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.349" end="00:00:39.179" style="s2">dream that was that awful could reflect a reality that could be that awful</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.969" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">and an additional</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.340" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">amazement out the fact that, despite</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.730" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">the production of thousands and tens and thousands of weapons of unimaginable destruction</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.329" end="00:00:56.759" style="s2">and that qualitative qualitative change in human capacity that represented</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.760" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">That people could go about their day-to-day lives without</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.270" end="00:01:04.499" style="s2">acting as if anything fundamental whatsoever had changed</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">Now I&#39;ve never really been able to figure out why that disturbed me so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.210" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">when it seemed to not disturb</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.790" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">to any</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">profound degree most of the people I knew</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.020" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.509" end="00:01:22.769" style="s2">The upshot of it was that I spent...</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.350" end="00:01:28.949" style="s2">I probably spent my whole life trying to understand what evil was and, more importantly, what might be done about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.440" end="00:01:35.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange pursuit in some ways for an academic done undertake because</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.380" end="00:01:41.680" style="s2">Academics tend to talk about academic things. And one thing you can say about evil is that, whatever it is, it&#39;s not bloody well academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.900" style="s2">It&#39;s not an intellectual issue. It&#39;s an existential issue and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.860" end="00:01:51.959" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not a theoretical issue. It&#39;s an it&#39;s an issue that deals with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.020" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">absolute nature of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.780" end="00:01:58.739" style="s2">I guess sometimes I think that people who go into Academia</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.740" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">Go into Academia to shield themselves from having to ask questions about the absolute nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.880" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.729" end="00:02:09.659" style="s2">Anyways, I think before you can talk about something</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">Before you can dare to talk about something like evil</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:16.220" style="s2">You should do some thinking about what it is that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.320" end="00:02:21.460" style="s2">Definitionally speaking. I learned this I believe from</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">a historian named Jeffrey Burton Russell</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">Who wrote a very detailed history of the idea of the Devil in the 1980s when,</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.340" end="00:02:34.440" style="s2">such histories were strange, to say the least, he was very interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:38.620" style="s2">in the history of the embodiment of ideas of evil and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.620" end="00:02:41.620" style="s2">One of the things his work did for me was to help me</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:44.860" style="s2">clarify the distinction between two terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:50.320" style="s2">The distinction that has to be made and that&#39;s the distinction between tragedy and evil</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.360" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think you can talk about it evil at all until you distinguish it from tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to try to distinguish evil from tragedy by making some reference to the essential existential condition of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:07.300" style="s2">I would say that the nature of the human being is such that it consists of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.300" end="00:03:11.300" style="s2">a confrontation with the bounded finite with the unbounded infinite,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.300" end="00:03:15.910" style="s2">and that those are the bare facts of the matter and the facts are that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.040" end="00:03:18.960" style="s2">The world of experience as it presents</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.160" end="00:03:20.420" style="s2">itself to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.580" end="00:03:22.980" style="s2">is literally and not metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:26.520" style="s2">complex beyond our capacity to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.600" end="00:03:30.800" style="s2">and that means  that people deal in a real sense on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.800" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">basis with the infinite and I believe that that fact is the reason why religious experience is essentially...</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">And belief is essentially endemic to mankind, it&#39;s a human universal</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s not because people believe, it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.240" end="00:03:50.600" style="s2">human existence as such consists of a confrontation between the finite and the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">and religious systems merely take that into account</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.920" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">Now our finitude in the face of the infinite has some inevitable consequences</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">and I would say those consequences</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:06.440" style="s2">are essentially the existential conditions of life. The first of those consequences is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:14.240" style="s2">the finite is always overwhelmed by the infinite, it has to be because it can&#39;t encapsulate it and so what that means is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:17.520" style="s2">that suffering is central to the nature of human existence</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">and suffering exists as a consequence of the consequences of our limitations</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.740" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">I mean every single person who&#39;s alive is going to die</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">And every single person who&#39;s alive is going to deal with serious physical illness and mental distress</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:37.660" style="s2">If they don&#39;t suffer, if they aren&#39;t suffering it directly, immediately, right now on their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">It&#39;s almost inevitably the case that every single person who walks the Earth</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">is confronting the bare bones of reality at that level in the guise of an afflicted family member</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">And so the fact of our finitude is again, no academic issue.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:58.740" style="s2">It&#39;s essential to the nature of our being and we&#39;re forced to deal with it on an ongoing basis</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">So I would say insufficiency is built into human experience and there are existential consequences to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">Now I read something a long time ago, and I don&#39;t remember who wrote it, but it was written about</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:15.780" style="s2">Jewish commentary on the Torah</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.840" end="00:05:18.700" style="s2">God is omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.700" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">omnipotent and omnipresent</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:23.480" style="s2">What does he lack?</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.220" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">And the answer is limitation</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">And that&#39;s a riddle and an answer of unparalleled brilliance</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.700" end="00:05:31.700" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned, because I think it speaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.100" end="00:05:35.760" style="s2">Deeply to something about the central nature of existence itself and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.550" end="00:05:38.550" style="s2">without limitation, there&#39;s no being</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.160" end="00:05:41.070" style="s2">Now that&#39;s a hard thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.070" end="00:05:43.820" style="s2">But I think you can understand it in a number of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.820" end="00:05:46.040" style="s2">the first thing you might want to understand is that...</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.760" end="00:05:50.100" style="s2">I play this game with my students sometimes in my class</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.100" end="00:05:53.860" style="s2">I&#39;ll come up to a student, I pick a poor victim at random and come up to them</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">and say: Okay, we&#39;re going to play a game</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:05:59.160" style="s2">And they say: ok. And I say: well you move first</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.710" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">well, they don&#39;t know what to do and the reason for that is because the limiting parameters of the game have not been defined</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:10.500" style="s2">And, as a consequence of that, they&#39;re stunned by their infinite freedom into complete immobility</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:16.350" style="s2">and what that means in a sense is that in the absence of serious constraint there can be no choice</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.350" end="00:06:19.780" style="s2">no freedom, no existence. And I believe this to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.120" end="00:06:25.760" style="s2">fundamentally true, just as the fact that human being is vulnerable is fundamentally true</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:29.820" style="s2">Here&#39;s another example that I think is more personal to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.120" end="00:06:34.540" style="s2">and it emerged in my imagination as a consequence of my contemplation of my son&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.760" end="00:06:39.420" style="s2">vulnerability. So I have children. They´re teenagers now. I still like them</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.539" end="00:06:46.298" style="s2">One of the things I was really struck by when my children were little was how perfect</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.299" end="00:06:49.089" style="s2">they were like and I believe that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:53.469" style="s2">Benevolence of God in a sense -  children are tremendously difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.469" end="00:06:59.160" style="s2">they&#39;re a tremendous responsibility - but they&#39;re so perfect and they manifest that perfection in such a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:06.320" style="s2">remarkable way that that&#39;s the payment for taking on the responsibility of bringing them into being and caring for them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.760" end="00:07:10.500" style="s2">The thing about being a parent is that the vulnerability of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">may manifest to you in a way that was never the case prior to that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.009" end="00:07:22.058" style="s2">It&#39;s not it&#39;s haunting and it&#39;s beautiful, but it&#39;s also exactly right in a way, and I was thinking well look at my son</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.059" end="00:07:22.659" style="s2">He&#39;s a little kid</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.660" end="00:07:26.360" style="s2">You know you got to chase after him all the time you can get sick people hurt him</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.500" end="00:07:29.920" style="s2">you know, people are going to be mean to him. He&#39;s going to be disappointed in his life</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.220" end="00:07:36.380" style="s2">He&#39;s vulnerable, and it&#39;s a constant tragic reality that he&#39;s vulnerable. And I thought well, okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.399" end="00:07:41.678" style="s2">Let&#39;s say we want to do something about that, so let&#39;s say we make him so that no one can pick on him</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.679" end="00:07:44.828" style="s2">so it could inflate him to about 20 feet high and equip him with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.439" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">metallic</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:51.639" style="s2">skeleton and a cast-iron exoskeleton, and you could equip him with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.189" end="00:07:58.299" style="s2">computerized intelligence that far supersedes his own, and you could remove his vulnerabilities one by one hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.300" end="00:07:59.539" style="s2">and of course more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.539" end="00:08:03.818" style="s2">We&#39;re in a position where we could do that in reality. And one of the things I realized right away was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.369" end="00:08:07.448" style="s2">as you remove the vulnerabilities you remove the thing you love</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.360" end="00:08:14.880" style="s2">And then I started to understand more deeply that vulnerability was a precondition for human being and that was a desirable</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.200" end="00:08:19.820" style="s2">precondition because the things about human existence that are wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:22.600" style="s2">remarkable are so integrally tied up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.000" end="00:08:25.420" style="s2">vulnerability that they&#39;re actually inextricable</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.460" end="00:08:29.460" style="s2">The Jewish commentary</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.839" end="00:08:31.159" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.160" end="00:08:33.160" style="s2">Infinite lacks is the finite</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:36.540" style="s2">There&#39;s a more abstract way of getting at the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.420" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">If you could do absolutely anything you wanted at any point</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:45.840" style="s2">and be anywhere you wanted, be anything you wanted and if there was nothing that was out of your reach</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">there would be nothing to do because you&#39;d be everything at once and when you&#39;re everything at once,</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:54.440" style="s2">which is at least in principle the position of God,</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.740" end="00:09:00.609" style="s2">There&#39;s no story and there&#39;s no being and there&#39;s something about being that is a story. And without limitation</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.610" end="00:09:07.899" style="s2">there&#39;s no story. So then the question starts to become, with regards to consideration of human vulnerability. Is there a way to conduct your life</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.450" end="00:09:12.939" style="s2">In such a manner that the intrinsic vulnerability that characterizes your life</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.060" end="00:09:20.679" style="s2">is rendered, not only acceptable but desirable. And to me that&#39;s the central question of existence. And I tell you, get that wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:25.899" style="s2">and you&#39;re on the wrong track and if you&#39;re on the wrong track, man, you are in one terrible place</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.740" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">I would say, with regards to tragedy, humans are vulnerable and that&#39;s tragic</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.960" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">But if tragedy is the price that we pay for existence then so be it if existence is justifiable</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:44.499" style="s2">And so tragedy itself, which is merely a revelation of our vulnerability, can&#39;t be regarded as evil</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.080" end="00:09:48.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just a... it&#39;s a condition of existence</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.600" end="00:09:54.580" style="s2">And so it&#39;s necessary to distinguish the tragic conditions of existence from evil before you can even address the problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.580" end="00:09:58.100" style="s2">And I think what that means to some degree is you should not blame on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.440" end="00:10:01.140" style="s2">relationship between the finite and the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.820" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">the terrible failings of humanity that can be laid directly at the feet of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.480" end="00:10:10.860" style="s2">So earthquakes aren&#39;t evil and cancer isn&#39;t evil and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">Mental illness isn&#39;t evil and predators aren&#39;t evil. They just are part of the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:20.280" style="s2">But there are certain categories of human action that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:26.600" style="s2">definitely outside the parameters of mere tragedy. And those are the things we really have to get a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.820" end="00:10:34.900" style="s2">Evil for me is differentiated from tragedy by its lack of necessity and it&#39;s volunteerism</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:36.140" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.580" end="00:10:41.560" style="s2">It&#39;s a tenant, I think, of modern materialistic thought that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:47.420" style="s2">there are social or material causes for actions and it&#39;s an extraordinarily useful theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:51.260" style="s2">And I think... but I think one of the unfortunate consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.280" end="00:10:55.480" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve tended to write off much of human misbehavior and attribute it to, say</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.790" end="00:10:57.400" style="s2">insufficiencies and material conditions</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.400" end="00:11:04.150" style="s2">which is not an it&#39;s not an acceptable theory. There are all sorts of human cultures that were characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.240" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">virtually complete absence of material</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.780" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">Luxury, well-being</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:13.720" style="s2">Whose cultures were highly functional and and highly moral</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.210" end="00:11:18.970" style="s2">And to describe the propensity towards misbehavior as a consequence of economic inequality</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.520" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">Is entirely beside the point as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.020" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">Evil is more pernicious than that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:32.470" style="s2">Which is generated for example by social inequality. I think it&#39;s actually, although</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.470" end="00:11:37.239" style="s2">this is a terrifying thought in some ways, it&#39;s more appropriate to consider it a form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.930" end="00:11:40.930" style="s2">demonically</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.330" end="00:11:42.530" style="s2">warped</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.530" end="00:11:46.600" style="s2">aesthetic. And I&#39;ll give you a couple of examples of what I mean by that for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.690" end="00:11:53.080" style="s2">Because the manifestation of this warped aesthetic makes itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:55.989" style="s2">apparent under certain conditions, so for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.990" end="00:12:01.780" style="s2">I think it made itself apparent in the imagination of the first politician who coined the acronym</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.810" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">MAD or Mutual Assured Destruction</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.470" end="00:12:09.910" style="s2">That&#39;s an aesthetic of Evil, to make a joke</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.670" end="00:12:12.729" style="s2">of a situation that catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.520" end="00:12:19.540" style="s2">indicates the kind of malevolence that lurks behind the fact that such a condition exists</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.580" end="00:12:23.580" style="s2">The motto on the gates of Auschwitz, I believe,</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.290" end="00:12:26.290" style="s2">in the second world war</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">Work will make you free</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.850" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">That&#39;s another manifestation of the aesthetic of evil. It&#39;s a terrible terrible</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.980" end="00:12:35.980" style="s2">ironic joke and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.990" end="00:12:41.260" style="s2">It&#39;s instructive to meditate on what sort of imagination would have the arrogance to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.980" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">tell such a terrible joke</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.850" end="00:12:49.899" style="s2">The concentration Camps are classic examples of evil</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.900" end="00:12:54.309" style="s2">And I think by analyzing at least certain kinds of events that occurred within them</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.310" end="00:12:58.960" style="s2">It&#39;s easier to get a clear idea of what evil constitutes. And one of the stories that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.510" end="00:13:03.100" style="s2">haunting me, I guess, is - I believe it&#39;s another story derived from Auschwitz -</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.710" end="00:13:09.579" style="s2">The prison guards in Auschwitz would take the prisoners who were already stripped of their dignity, and to whatever degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.740" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">possible, their identity and their culture and their language and their status as valuable beings. And yet that wasn&#39;t sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.820" end="00:13:23.140" style="s2">they needed to be tortured in addition to that before they were killed and the torture often consisted of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.960" end="00:13:25.960" style="s2">self-evidently counterproductive work</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.230" end="00:13:35.079" style="s2">A situation that also frequently characterized activity in the soviet gulag archipelago where perhaps 60 million people met their death</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.280" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">A typical Auschwitz example was the requirement for prisoners to carry 100-pound sacks of wet salt from one side of the compound and then back again</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.470" end="00:13:47.559" style="s2">Now that&#39;s evil as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.560" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">and you have to think about it from an aesthetic perspective in a sense because it&#39;s a celebration of horror</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">And it&#39;s a conscious attempt to violate the conditions that make life itself tolerable, and it&#39;s aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.560" end="00:14:04.790" style="s2">dehumanization</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.790" end="00:14:06.790" style="s2">destruction of the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.010" end="00:14:09.010" style="s2">And at an even deeper level,</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.340" end="00:14:12.100" style="s2">revenge against the conditions of existence itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to understand the developmental pathway that leads to acts like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.520" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">My academic research as well as my clinical experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.840" end="00:14:27.840" style="s2">Has revealed to me that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.300" end="00:14:34.960" style="s2">What appears to lie at the bottom of motivation for the excesses of behavior that characterize evil</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.300" end="00:14:38.960" style="s2">are too tightly causally related factors</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.340" end="00:14:43.720" style="s2">one, arrogance and another resentment</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.760" end="00:14:47.820" style="s2">And both of those are tied up with</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.660" end="00:14:56.340" style="s2">vulnerability of human beings in the face of the infinite but</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.340" end="00:15:00.340" style="s2">but tied up with something more</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.620" end="00:15:02.620" style="s2">profound as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.750" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">The most thorough account of this that I&#39;ve managed, I think, at least to partially comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:12.200" style="s2">I believe is contained in the first couple of the stories in the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.000" end="00:15:14.300" style="s2">In Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.740" end="00:15:20.820" style="s2">The story of Adam and Eve and the fall of man. And the immediately following story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:29.140" style="s2">As far as we can tell those are very very old stories. They predate judaism at least in some of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.040" end="00:15:32.260" style="s2">in some of their structural elements</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.540" end="00:15:37.960" style="s2">It&#39;s conceivable that some of the and those stories are as old as the human capacity to tell stories itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.570" end="00:15:42.969" style="s2">Assuming that they were grounded in an oral tradition that predated the written tradition</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.970" end="00:15:47.800" style="s2">and we know that oral traditions can last at least in some forms unchanged for periods of up to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:53.169" style="s2">25,000 years, so the anthropological and archaeological evidence is fairly clear on that point</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.900" end="00:15:56.530" style="s2">these are very very very old stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.080" end="00:16:00.820" style="s2">And people remember them and created them for reasons we really don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.980" end="00:16:05.940" style="s2">And they&#39;re strange and mysterious and unforgettable all at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.860" end="00:16:13.020" style="s2">The story of Adam and Eve, as far as I can tell, is the story of the coming of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.140" end="00:16:15.900" style="s2">The coming of self-consciousness to Mankind</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.640" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">And, I think that the human</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.060" end="00:16:27.520" style="s2">The human self-consciousness is what separates us from animals</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.300" end="00:16:30.540" style="s2">In Genesis there&#39;s an insistence that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.650" end="00:16:36.519" style="s2">When Adam ate the apple that eve offered to him the scales fell from his eyes and the first thing that he realized was that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.520" end="00:16:37.580" style="s2">He was naked</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.580" end="00:16:40.509" style="s2">And what that seems to me to mean is that, I mean...</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.510" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">I think it means first of all that women make men self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:48.279" style="s2">And I think there&#39;s ample reason to presume not and there&#39;s good evolutionary reasons for suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.280" end="00:16:51.220" style="s2">why that might be the case. Because sexual selection among</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.500" end="00:16:56.829" style="s2">human beings has been a primary force of evolutionary development and sexual selection in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.710" end="00:16:58.910" style="s2">is primarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.910" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">conducted by women. So, for example, as Roy has pointed out in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.070" end="00:17:06.159" style="s2">his address to the APA a few years ago,</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:12.489" style="s2">and I hope I get this right, twice as many of your relatives where women as men. And that means that women</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.800" end="00:17:17.979" style="s2">are more frequently reproductive successful than men and that they reject most men</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.530" end="00:17:25.149" style="s2">And the rejection of a man for reproductive purposes by a woman is the most serious form of rejection that&#39;s possible from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.220" end="00:17:27.170" style="s2">point of view because the judgment is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.170" end="00:17:32.820" style="s2">Well you might be nice enough to talk to but you&#39;re sure not fit to have your genes propagate into the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:37.000" style="s2">So it&#39;s no wonder that women can make men self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.000" end="00:17:42.310" style="s2">And I think there&#39;s some reason to presume that it&#39;s the sexual selection forces that women placed upon man</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.310" end="00:17:47.169" style="s2">That drove rapid human cortical evolution and the development of self-consciousness. Now that&#39;s a leap</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.170" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">And there&#39;s no way I can justify that in the course of this particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.840" end="00:17:54.280" style="s2">talk but I think there is good reason to presume that it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.900" end="00:18:01.080" style="s2">In Genesis human beings become self-conscious and the first thing that happens to them is that they realize they&#39;re naked and then the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.090" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">that happens to them is they develop the moral sense to tell the difference between good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.870" end="00:18:09.250" style="s2">And it&#39;s a very strange thing because in some sense before a creature is self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.250" end="00:18:13.900" style="s2">there is no distinction between good and evil because as I said before a predator is not evil</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.900" end="00:18:19.060" style="s2">It&#39;s just a predator. The fact of a predator like a wolf might be a tragedy for the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.060" end="00:18:22.749" style="s2">But you can&#39;t be assuming that the wolf is evil merely because it wants to eat the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.749" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">but with the dawning of self-consciousness there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.500" end="00:18:33.340" style="s2">the emergence of a moral sense that&#39;s essentially unique to human beings and that has something to do with our</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:38.709" style="s2">capacity to reflect upon the mechanisms of our action and then, for some reason, to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.780" end="00:18:42.999" style="s2">modify those actions and to choose which ones to implement into the future, in the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.000" end="00:18:49.180" style="s2">We don&#39;t understand that and you can even deny if you&#39;d like that the phenomena of free choice exists</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.180" end="00:18:50.750" style="s2">But our culture is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.750" end="00:18:56.170" style="s2">predicated on the notion that it does exist and in the absence of evidence that it doesn&#39;t I&#39;m going to take the easy way out</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.170" end="00:18:58.070" style="s2">and assume that it does</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.070" end="00:19:00.669" style="s2">Otherwise things fall apart and they fall apart badly</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.210" end="00:19:03.980" style="s2">When...</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.980" end="00:19:10.150" style="s2">After Adam and Eve becomes self conscious the first thing they do is close themselves. And to me that&#39;s a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.520" end="00:19:13.320" style="s2">description of the emergence of culture as an</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.660" end="00:19:16.180" style="s2">intersession between the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.420" end="00:19:22.100" style="s2">vulnerability and nakedness of the human form and the depredations of nature. If you realize that you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">and prone to death the first thing you&#39;re going to do is to start rearranging the manner in which you construe yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:30.729" style="s2">So that you can protect yourself from such an unfortunate outcome</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.190" end="00:19:33.879" style="s2">that&#39;s, I think, partly why God curses Adam with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.950" end="00:19:39.340" style="s2">necessity of work once he finds out, once God finds out that people have become self conscious. Like if you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.560" end="00:19:44.560" style="s2">that winter is lurking in the future, for example, you&#39;re going to work and animals don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.560" end="00:19:46.360" style="s2">they&#39;re just motivated to do whatever they do</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.360" end="00:19:49.540" style="s2">But humans work and that means they subvert their day to day</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:56.260" style="s2">motivations, their immediate motivations for the purposes of future security and there&#39;s a real cost to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.260" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">I mean, part of the cost is separation from the pure and unadulterated flow of animal life, and I believe that people suffer from that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">absence of flow</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.800" end="00:20:09.940" style="s2">continually and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.940" end="00:20:11.999" style="s2">the advantage they gain from it</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:18.940" style="s2">Is that they can plan for the future, but the disadvantage is that they&#39;re calculative and cold and separated from their own instinctual resources</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.180" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">Eve, of course, is cursed by what&#39;s going to be terrible pain in childbirth, and that&#39;s related to the development of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.050" end="00:20:34.709" style="s2">the Immense skull size that characterizes human infants and their incredibly lengthy period of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.950" end="00:20:39.089" style="s2">dependence which is also associated with their immense brain</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.170" end="00:20:44.879" style="s2">After Adam and eve become self-conscious they hide</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.790" end="00:20:47.940" style="s2">And this is actually a comical part of genesis</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.940" end="00:20:52.679" style="s2">it&#39;s never really read as a comedy, but it is a comedy even the fall itself is a comedy and...</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:55.589" style="s2">so they&#39;re hiding away behind a bush</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.410" end="00:21:02.820" style="s2">and God comes walking through the garden and God, the infinite, is accustomed to walking with Adam, with no</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.940" end="00:21:06.200" style="s2">interruption of the flow of information between them</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">But Adam is in error and God says you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.560" end="00:21:12.820" style="s2">Where where have you gone and Adam says: Oh well</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.840" end="00:21:18.870" style="s2">I&#39;m hiding. And God says, which is kind of stupid really and this is why it&#39;s a comics, like he&#39;s hiding behind a bush</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.060" end="00:21:23.700" style="s2">This is God, and he can see through bushes and like Adam should know that. But It doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.700" end="00:21:29.159" style="s2">He&#39;s hiding me on this bush anyways and God... So Adam says I&#39;m hiding and and God says: Well</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.160" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">well why are you hiding? Well it&#39;s because Adam is ashamed and...</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.910" end="00:21:36.509" style="s2">Adam says: Well, I&#39;m naked</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.630" end="00:21:39.630" style="s2">And this is an example of the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.150" end="00:21:45.389" style="s2">compression of Human wisdom into a few lines that characterizes mythology. You could say: Well, why would people hide from God</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:51.359" style="s2">once they realize they&#39;re naked? And I would say well, that&#39;s pretty obvious, like, once you know you&#39;re vulnerable.</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.580" end="00:21:56.309" style="s2">Or do you really have enough courage to manifest any sort of semblance of a divine destiny?</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.830" end="00:21:59.159" style="s2">Well, the answer to that is pretty much, clearly no</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.160" end="00:22:04.859" style="s2">And it&#39;s no bloody wonder. And so the hiding is... People hide when they&#39;re self-conscious and vulnerable. And what are they hiding from then?</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.860" end="00:22:10.260" style="s2">They&#39;re hiding from their deepest destiny and it&#39;s no wonder. God says: Okay, yeah, well you figured that out</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.260" end="00:22:15.239" style="s2">and how that happened. And Adam says, and this is comical too, It was the woman&#39;s fault. Which I think is really funny and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:20.340" style="s2">which actually may have been the original sin and not the eating of the apple, right? The first time that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.470" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">the man blamed the woman for his self-conscious misery</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:28.980" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the real fall and not the rise of self-consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.800" end="00:22:33.450" style="s2">Anyways, we know the rest of the story. God says: Oh, well the cats out of the bag now.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:39.509" style="s2">You know you&#39;re vulnerable and from here on in history starts. Your out of paradise, you&#39;re out of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.880" end="00:22:45.810" style="s2">identification with the natural world. You&#39;re going to work, you&#39;re going to sweat lots of the time it isn&#39;t going to work and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.300" end="00:22:50.550" style="s2">Women, they&#39;re going to be beholden to their husbands not because that&#39;s divine</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.160" end="00:22:53.550" style="s2">fiat, but because the developmental...</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.310" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">The developmental dependency of a human infant is so extreme that women are cursed to rely on men for protection</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">when they&#39;re at their most vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.490" end="00:23:09.060" style="s2">Fine. So that&#39;s self-consciousness and an explanation for why people would hide away from their destiny</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.060" end="00:23:11.609" style="s2">But then the next story, the Cain and Abel story really</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.280" end="00:23:17.670" style="s2">elaborates that out and describes it. And so Cain and Abel, of course, are two sons of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.670" end="00:23:19.660" style="s2">And they&#39;re really the first people</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.660" end="00:23:21.810" style="s2">Because, of course Adam and Eve were made by God</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.850" end="00:23:27.329" style="s2">so they&#39;re really not people at all because people are born. And Cain and Abel are the first two people</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.910" end="00:23:30.300" style="s2">And they characterized, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:40.760" style="s2">to canonical patterns of reaction, to the terrible vulnerability that&#39;s revealed as a consequence of the development of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.380" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">Cain and Abel make sacrifices to God</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:50.970" style="s2">Human cultures make sacrifices. That&#39;s what they do, sacrifice, sacrificial rituals is human universal</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.300" end="00:23:54.300" style="s2">blood sacrifices is human universal</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:56.999" style="s2">human sacrifice, at least in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.460" end="00:24:03.869" style="s2">anthropological epochs was regarded as a human universal. Why do people make sacrifices to God to please them?</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.390" end="00:24:06.450" style="s2">It seems like a mystery to modern people</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:10.760" style="s2">I ask my students. What sacrifices did you make to go to university?</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.240" end="00:24:12.160" style="s2">Well, they can answer that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.160" end="00:24:17.670" style="s2">2/10 of a second. You know they can&#39;t party as much as they might have they can&#39;t drink nearly as much beer as they might</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.670" end="00:24:22.800" style="s2">have liked to. More seriously, a lot of them work, a lot of them have put their families in</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.800" end="00:24:28.680" style="s2">serious financial straits to send them to university. They&#39;ve given up all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.890" end="00:24:35.339" style="s2">In order to pursue a course of action that they believe will best ensure their harmonious relationship with the nature of reality?</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.769" end="00:24:42.389" style="s2">Everyone makes sacrifices. Ok, we can say that now because we&#39;re psychologically sophisticated and linguistically sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.390" end="00:24:44.140" style="s2">We know something about human psychology</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.140" end="00:24:49.289" style="s2">But thousands and thousands of years ago, before people had this explicit psychological acumen, the best</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.289" end="00:24:55.100" style="s2">they could do is act out and tell stories about human psychology because they hadn&#39;t developed any further than that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.280" end="00:24:57.500" style="s2">And Cain and Abel is one of those stories</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:01.470" style="s2">The Sacrifices are burnt on an altar</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.470" end="00:25:04.319" style="s2">Why? Well a smoke rises. Well,</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:08.820" style="s2">so what? Well God&#39;s up in the sky and if the smoke rises up there, and he gets a whiff of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.820" end="00:25:12.389" style="s2">He can tell what the quality of the sacrifice was and you can laugh about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.389" end="00:25:15.179" style="s2">And you can think it. You can think about it as primitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.179" end="00:25:17.729" style="s2">But it&#39;s not primitive, its artistic and it&#39;s beautiful in it</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.730" end="00:25:19.949" style="s2">And it&#39;s accurate. And here&#39;s why, is because</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">before the invention of the electrical light and maybe before the invention of fire and...</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.480" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">The closest a human being could ever get to direct confrontation with the absolute unknown was to look up at the night sky</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.200" end="00:25:37.400" style="s2">Because the night sky, especially when it&#39;s sprinkled with stars</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.480" end="00:25:41.500" style="s2">confronts you directly with the fact of the infinite. And to make the presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">that God resides in the infinite, and you&#39;re having a direct experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:49.800" style="s2">of the infinite at that moment, is not a primitive notion it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.160" end="00:25:52.820" style="s2">intelligent and and creative hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:58.740" style="s2">And so, the notion that god occupies the sky, the day sky being equally as impressive as the night sky, is not a primitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.110" end="00:26:06.059" style="s2">hypothesis, it&#39;s a reflection of the nature of a certain kind of human experience. You burn something and you send the smoke up</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.060" end="00:26:08.780" style="s2">God gets a crack at determining the quality</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.860" end="00:26:11.680" style="s2">of your offering, the quality of your sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.680" end="00:26:14.920" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s be perfectly clear about this</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.040" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">If your sacrifices aren&#39;t first-rate the nature of your relationship with the infinite is going to suffer dreadfully</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">And that&#39;s exactly what the story of Cain and Abel reveals.</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.639" end="00:26:25.750" style="s2">Now, Abel</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.750" end="00:26:31.769" style="s2">He&#39;s a trusting character. He believes in the nature of experience, in the nature of existence. When he&#39;s called on to make a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.769" end="00:26:38.849" style="s2">he sacrifices the best that he has to offer and that makes God happy and as a consequence everything that abel touches turns to gold</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.000" end="00:26:43.620" style="s2">Everyone likes him, they respect him. His crops multiply, he&#39;s successful with women</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.700" end="00:26:50.940" style="s2">Plus he&#39;s a wonderful guy, so you could hardly imagine a more annoying creature if you possibly attempted to do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.940" end="00:26:56.190" style="s2">Whereas Cain has reacted to his self-consciousness by withdrawing from the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.190" end="00:27:01.440" style="s2">And there&#39;s a tremendous danger in that because it starts to mean that he relies purely on his own</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.020" end="00:27:04.020" style="s2">devious devices to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:07.180" style="s2">Sale his ship through the shores of life</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.340" end="00:27:14.040" style="s2">He believes, as his arrogance develops, as a consequence of this withdrawal from the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.350" end="00:27:21.240" style="s2">A contact that he can&#39;t tolerate because he can&#39;t tolerate his own vulnerability, that he is able to deceive the structure of reality itself to offer</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.490" end="00:27:25.020" style="s2">second-rate sacrifices to God himself, who can see</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.300" end="00:27:30.059" style="s2">absolutely everything because the infinite is absolutely everything and to prevail nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.340" end="00:27:33.150" style="s2">Well, needless to say this does not work</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.150" end="00:27:39.689" style="s2">And it doesn&#39;t work in an obvious way if you talk to people and they reveal to you their</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.059" end="00:27:44.729" style="s2">unnecessary suffering it&#39;s very straightforward to look behind what it is that they have to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.490" end="00:27:47.729" style="s2">They&#39;ll tell you the poor decisions they made</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.730" end="00:27:51.839" style="s2">in their lives and the opportunities that they didn&#39;t take and the chances that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.300" end="00:27:57.989" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have enough courage to grasp and the sacrifices they fail to make. There&#39;s nothing mysterious about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.540" end="00:28:04.349" style="s2">And their own experiences teach them full well that they pathologized the relationship they have with the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.290" end="00:28:08.369" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a terrible thing. Well, and Cain is dreadfully unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.800" end="00:28:11.489" style="s2">He&#39;s unhappy because nothing he ever wants happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.489" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">And that&#39;s partly because he doesn&#39;t really want it because if he really wanted he&#39;d make the right sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.340" end="00:28:21.560" style="s2">And the salt is rubbed into his wounds by the existence of his brother, for whom everything seems simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.570" end="00:28:24.630" style="s2">But of course really isn&#39;t. Cain goes to complain to God</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.780" end="00:28:30.689" style="s2">And I had to read three or four different translations of these particular verses to figure out what this meant</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.390" end="00:28:33.390" style="s2">And he says</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.610" end="00:28:37.380" style="s2">What in the world is going on here? I&#39;m working myself to the bone</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.380" end="00:28:40.410" style="s2">I&#39;m sacrificing things left right and center. Everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.410" end="00:28:45.929" style="s2">I touch turns to dirt, everything turns against me. Like, what&#39;s up with the nature of reality?</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.620" end="00:28:49.660" style="s2">Cain&#39;s essential vulnerability is revealed</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.060" end="00:28:56.380" style="s2">And exacerbated by his pathological attitude towards his own actions. God says to him, essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.280" end="00:28:59.280" style="s2">Sin is a predatory cat that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">crouches at your doorway and leaps on you at will</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">But if you only wanted to, you could master it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.400" end="00:29:07.400" style="s2">And that is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.540" end="00:29:13.340" style="s2">the last thing that Cain wants to hear because if things are going from bad to worse for you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.350" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">and you&#39;re playing a causal role in it</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.900" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing more horrible that someone can do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.220" end="00:29:25.500" style="s2">But reveal to you in a way that you can&#39;t deny, that you&#39;re entirely complicit in your own demise</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:30.180" style="s2">And that&#39;s exactly what God does to Cain. And so, what does Cain do?</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.000" end="00:29:36.300" style="s2">Well the logical thing would be listen because if the structure of reality itself tells you something</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.300" end="00:29:43.680" style="s2">It&#39;s best to listen since there&#39;s no way out of it. But that&#39;s not what Cain does. He&#39;s so incensed by his essential vulnerability,</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.220" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">compromised and exacerbated by his failure to make the appropriate sacrifices and to conduct himself appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:55.960" style="s2">that he decides, then and there, number one, to destroy his ideal, to reduce the tension that he feels</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:02.789" style="s2">when that ideal exists as a contrast point and number two, to destroy the favorite son of God. And so he goes out into the field</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.790" end="00:30:08.129" style="s2">and kills Abel. And God comes along and says: Where&#39;s my favorite son? And Cain says:</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.800" end="00:30:10.500" style="s2">I killed him</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">And it&#39;s so interesting to me that that story is placed... Really, it&#39;s the third story in the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.370" end="00:30:19.290" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s with the archaic stories</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.290" end="00:30:24.740" style="s2">And it&#39;s a story that reveals, as far as I can tell, that there are two essential patterns of reaction to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:29.020" style="s2">self-conscious vulnerable conditions of existence. And one is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.340" end="00:30:30.180" style="s2">humble</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.600" end="00:30:35.920" style="s2">approach to infinity with determined attempts to make the appropriate sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.980" end="00:30:40.020" style="s2">The other is arrogance, resentment, the keeping of everything good for oneself</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.020" end="00:30:44.600" style="s2">and the degeneration of the soul into something that&#39;s homicidally murderous</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.980" end="00:30:48.780" style="s2">Well the story doesn&#39;t stop there. It gets really compressed in this part</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.780" end="00:30:53.670" style="s2">And that&#39;s perhaps because some of its being lost with the passages of time. But the next thing that happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.760" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">Well, God doesn&#39;t punish Cain</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.340" end="00:30:59.320" style="s2">And you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.320" end="00:31:03.599" style="s2">That&#39;s kind of strange. I mean, in the whole old testament, God, he&#39;s punishing people left right and center</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:06.030" style="s2">Why not Cain? And you think, well</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.160" end="00:31:10.699" style="s2">He marks Cain, and he says to the people who are around that they should leave him alone</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.220" end="00:31:14.959" style="s2">Because he&#39;s been marked by God as to be left alone. And the reason for that I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:18.410" style="s2">And this is something that&#39;s reflected in our legal system, is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.920" end="00:31:20.920" style="s2">Murder promotes revenge</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.480" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">And revenge destroys societies. And so God puts an end to the situation, right there and then, by telling people</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.440" end="00:31:31.060" style="s2">that, despite the fact that Cain has</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.820" end="00:31:37.380" style="s2">has committed a terrible crime that there will be no retribution</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.000" end="00:31:45.140" style="s2">Cain goes off and gets married and he has a number of generations of offspring</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.620" end="00:31:51.860" style="s2">If you insult a member of the first generation of Cain&#39;s offspring</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.420" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t kill you, it kills seven of you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:58.940" style="s2">And if you insult a member of the second generation of Cain&#39;s offspring</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.190" end="00:32:02.839" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t kill seven of you, he kills seven times seven of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.510" end="00:32:10.070" style="s2">And then on down the road of the offspring of Cain is Tubal Cain</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.830" end="00:32:12.780" style="s2">And Tubal Cain is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.780" end="00:32:14.989" style="s2">artificer of weapons of War and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.780" end="00:32:16.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.920" end="00:32:24.649" style="s2">Stunningly Brilliant story says in it&#39;s incredibly compressed fashion that the motivation that drives</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.110" end="00:32:32.449" style="s2">the commission of the worst human atrocities is an inevitable social consequence of the refusal of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.760" end="00:32:38.329" style="s2">self-conscious individual to make the sacrifices appropriate to establishing a harmonious life and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.700" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">their consequent degeneration into a kind of murderous and resentment filled rage</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.330" end="00:32:52.520" style="s2">propagating endlessly through its variations in society until everything comes to an end</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.040" end="00:32:55.369" style="s2">And the next story is the flood</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.730" end="00:32:58.560" style="s2">And it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.560" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">Because if things go from bad to worse long enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.700" end="00:33:04.620" style="s2">everything Falls</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.620" end="00:33:09.109" style="s2">And it&#39;s a terrifying story. I didn&#39;t understand that story. I didn&#39;t understand that story for years</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.240" end="00:33:11.660" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t really until I read Alexandr Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.120" end="00:33:18.170" style="s2">that I developed, I think, the cognitive capacity then to even understand what the story meant because</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.690" end="00:33:21.590" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn said in its Nobel prize accepting speech</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.200" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">A single person who stop flying can bring down a tyranny, which is a stunning thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:31.459" style="s2">But I would also say something that&#39;s been amply demonstrated in the 20th century because we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.710" end="00:33:38.059" style="s2">historical examples of people who did precisely that. Gandhi did it, Václav Havel did it, Nelson Mandela did it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.669" end="00:33:43.999" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the ax blows that brought down the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.220" end="00:33:47.400" style="s2">A stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book by</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.400" end="00:33:51.960" style="s2">memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim, this far away from starvation</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.100" end="00:33:52.940" style="s2">It shows you,</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.060" end="00:33:59.520" style="s2">as clearly as anything possibly can, how powerful the human spirit can be if it&#39;s willing to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.780" end="00:34:07.540" style="s2">obligation of its relationship with the divine. And also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:11.300" style="s2">Now, it&#39;s no wonder as far as I can tell that people don&#39;t think this way because</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.179" end="00:34:14.539" style="s2">Thinking this way is it&#39;s catastrophic in a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.909" end="00:34:19.848" style="s2">Because the burden it places on the individual is so extreme that it&#39;s almost unbearable while in a...</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.849" end="00:34:27.019" style="s2">But that&#39;s exactly why it is in Genesis, to begin with, that Adam hides, but he becomes conscious of his own vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.020" end="00:34:30.770" style="s2">It&#39;s like, he thinks well a creature such as I, I could never bear such a burden well</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.839" end="00:34:33.169" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more to people than meets the eye</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.389" end="00:34:37.459" style="s2">And the only way I learned that was by looking at people&#39;s and my own. People&#39;s and my own</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.530" end="00:34:39.949" style="s2">capacity for Evil, because I started to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.020" end="00:34:47.089" style="s2">we regard ourselves as narrow little beings in a particular kind of box and there&#39;s real comfort in that although there&#39;s tremendous limitation</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.089" end="00:34:52.009" style="s2">You cannot see your way out of that box until you know. Well what I teach my students</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.010" end="00:34:53.629" style="s2">I teach them about Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.629" end="00:34:58.879" style="s2">and I try to make them understand that there&#39;s an overwhelming probability if they were in Nazi Germany in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.839" style="s2">1930s that they would have been perpetrators and nazis. An overwhelming probability</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:08.089" style="s2">And if they can&#39;t accept that, because it&#39;s a historical fact, they have absolutely no idea who they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.000" end="00:35:13.669" style="s2">Now, imagining yourself as a nazi perpetrator is an unbearably terrifying thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.740" end="00:35:15.500" style="s2">But I don&#39;t believe that you can do...</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.500" end="00:35:19.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that you have any insight whatsoever into your capacity for good</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.820" end="00:35:24.300" style="s2">until you have some well-developed insight into your capacity for evil</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.300" end="00:35:28.760" style="s2">Because people can tell you till they&#39;re blue in their face about your capacity for good, it just sounds like...</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:33.830" style="s2">It sounds like wishful thinking. It sounds like the sort of thing that an advertiser might tell you on TV</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.830" end="00:35:35.830" style="s2">It&#39;s just too good to be true</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.070" end="00:35:38.070" style="s2">And I don&#39;t think people believe it</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.200" end="00:35:43.530" style="s2">But I think that if you tell people that, you know, in the cold dark corners of their mind there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.660" end="00:35:46.949" style="s2">motivations that are so terrible that they would, they would traumatize</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.710" end="00:35:53.160" style="s2">themselves if they were ever revealed, that everyone knows at some level of analysis that that&#39;s absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.180" end="00:35:58.920" style="s2">You think... There&#39;s evidence throughout history that it&#39;s possible for people to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.940" end="00:36:02.100" style="s2">enlightened. And you&#39;d think,</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:08.130" style="s2">since enlightenment is viewed as the medication for vulnerability and death that everybody would be struggling</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.280" end="00:36:13.060" style="s2">as hard as they possibly could to be enlightened, if such a state exactly and precisely</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.080" end="00:36:20.100" style="s2">exists, but if the barrier to enlightenment is the development of self consciousness of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.220" end="00:36:22.660" style="s2">human&#39;s infinite capacity for evil then you can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:24.180" style="s2">immediately</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.180" end="00:36:26.280" style="s2">convinced about why</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.500" end="00:36:28.860" style="s2">Enlightenment is in such short supply</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:31.100" style="s2">When I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.340" end="00:36:38.120" style="s2">finished my first provisional examination of the sorts of motivations that drove people to set up concentration camps</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.070" end="00:36:43.890" style="s2">and to torture people terribly in those camps, I came to a terrible conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">It was a conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.920" end="00:36:52.060" style="s2">I think in some ways was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, maybe intellectually and morally, I thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:53.780" style="s2">I came to understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.790" end="00:36:57.180" style="s2">why it is that people depended on their group identity in their cultural identification,</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:00.180" style="s2">because that helped protect themselves from their own vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">You have to believe things because you just don&#39;t know everything so you have to believe things they fill in the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:06.820" style="s2">the beliefs fill in the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.820" end="00:37:09.449" style="s2">If the beliefs are stripped from you then your</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:13.770" style="s2">defenses against the infinite are stripped. And it&#39;s no wonder that people will defend their beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.180" end="00:37:22.289" style="s2">I thought, well you do if you&#39;re too involved in defending your beliefs, you&#39;re going to be willing to kill other people in their defence</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.289" end="00:37:28.580" style="s2">And we&#39;re so technologically powerful now that we can no longer be willing to kill other people in the defense of our own beliefs because</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.580" end="00:37:30.440" style="s2">the time for that is passed</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.600" end="00:37:35.430" style="s2">And I realized well with you if you don&#39;t stand up for your beliefs you leave yourself bereft</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.430" end="00:37:38.600" style="s2">You&#39;re open to the depredations of the infinite. That&#39;s equally</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:41.420" style="s2">intolerable, it seems to leave no way out</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.900" end="00:37:46.820" style="s2">There is a way out, you know, and I think it&#39;s the way out that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:54.899" style="s2">genuinely religious people have tried to offer humanity for thousands and thousands of years. And the way out of the conundrum</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.620" end="00:38:03.060" style="s2">posed to you by your reliance on ideological beliefs and your vulnerability in the face of the unknown, is the development of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.160" end="00:38:07.320" style="s2">a truly integrated and powerful character. And that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.600" end="00:38:09.600" style="s2">individual development and it means</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:17.800" style="s2">constant confrontation with things you don&#39;t understand and constant attempts to ensure that your character is composed of truth and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.880" end="00:38:19.880" style="s2">solidity Rather than deceit</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">And to make of yourself something that&#39;s built on a rock and not predicated on sand. And the thing is, it&#39;s one thing to tell people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.080" end="00:38:29.300" style="s2">because maybe they should take care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.700" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s enough to tell people because they don&#39;t take care of themselves that well</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:39.700" style="s2">But it&#39;s a completely other thing to say look, you know, every time you make a pathological moral decision</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.700" end="00:38:43.640" style="s2">you move the one the world one step closer to complete annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.640" end="00:38:48.920" style="s2">And I absolutely believe that. I think the historical evidence is crystal clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.920" end="00:38:55.800" style="s2">And I also think that every time you make an appropriate moral decision, and you manifest moral courage in the face of your own vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.800" end="00:38:58.860" style="s2">then you move the world one step farther from the break</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.080" end="00:39:06.980" style="s2">And every...  that&#39;s the case for every single person. You know, Solzhenitsyn said, drawing on his eastern orthodox christian background:</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.560" end="00:39:09.940" style="s2">Every single person is the center of the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.440" end="00:39:16.620" style="s2">As center of the world, not &#39;the&#39; center of the world. The world is a complicated place. It can have all sorts of centers</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.620" end="00:39:19.220" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to believe that you might be one of them, but</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.900" end="00:39:21.900" style="s2">everything about human existence is hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.080" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">The fact that it&#39;s here at all is hard to believe, the nature of it&#39;s hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.280" end="00:39:28.280" style="s2">Everything that human beings does is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.980" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">ridiculous and remarkable that it&#39;s like it&#39;s a consistently and constantly unfolding miracle. The idea that each of you might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.880" end="00:39:39.220" style="s2">a center of the cosmos, in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.580" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">infinite admixture of ridiculousness and absurdities, is hardly more than one more ridiculous thing to swallow</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.100" end="00:39:50.100" style="s2">Well I&#39;ll summarize, I guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.860" end="00:39:53.580" style="s2">I said that tragedy is a precondition for being</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.840" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">Being is the interplay between the finite and the infinite. And in that interplay there&#39;s tragedy. And there&#39;s no way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.500" end="00:40:03.500" style="s2">Evil is something different</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:11.669" style="s2">Evil is the conscious attempt to make the conditions of existence more pathological than they have to be. And it&#39;s motivated by conscious intent</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.369" end="00:40:17.669" style="s2">The motivations arise because people pay a terrible price for their self conscious awareness</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.669" end="00:40:23.480" style="s2">And that awareness is their awareness of their vulnerability. And that is a terrible thing to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.100" end="00:40:35.180" style="s2">That vulnerability can be confronted forthrightly, accepted, and the appropriate decisions made. Alternatively people can retreat into their own</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">rationalistic arrogance and attempt to deceive themselves and everyone else about the nature of their own existence and about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:46.740" style="s2">That Pathway leads to nothing but destruction</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.600" end="00:40:53.940" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s good reason to assume that it&#39;s too late in the...</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.940" end="00:40:57.560" style="s2">in our developmental course as a species for that path to be acceptable anymore</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.880" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">because we&#39;re too powerful, and if too many people stay on that path, we&#39;re going to do ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.480" end="00:41:11.180" style="s2">So I would say as we&#39;ve become more technologically powerful, an increasing moral burden is being placed on each of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.180" end="00:41:18.740" style="s2">It matters, to the destiny of the cosmos, whether or not you get your moral act straight</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.860" end="00:41:20.820" style="s2">And I don&#39;t mean that in a trivial way</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.000" end="00:41:24.540" style="s2">I believe that that&#39;s as close to an empirical fact as anything that can be demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.540" end="00:41:31.300" style="s2">And I also believe that&#39;s as terrifying a thing to consider as anything you could possibly imagine. And maybe it&#39;s too much to ask of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.300" end="00:41:33.960" style="s2">But you know our great religious traditions do</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.020" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">continually remind us that inside every human being there&#39;s a spark of divinity. And that idea is a precondition</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:43.160" style="s2">for our entire system of law</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.500" end="00:41:46.680" style="s2">There&#39;s always the possibility that it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.680" end="00:41:52.649" style="s2">And if it&#39;s true it means that there is an infinite avenue of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.980" end="00:41:57.240" style="s2">potential that lays open to every single person. And that the ability</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.400" end="00:42:02.579" style="s2">to transform the terrible conditions of reality into something, not only acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.580" end="00:42:05.980" style="s2">but worthy of celebration, actually lies within our grasp</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.660" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">An alternative to that, the alternative to that is the continual generation of a kind of hell. That&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.280" end="00:42:17.300" style="s2">incomprehensibly awful that,</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.060" end="00:42:21.540" style="s2">by any reasonable person standards,</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.540" end="00:42:23.580" style="s2">it has to be regarded as something to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.500" end="00:42:30.500" style="s2">That&#39;s all I have to say about that.</p>
