<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:06.950" style="s2">so you know from from there I went to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:11.329" style="s2">school Nova Scotia</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.950" end="00:03:13.849" style="s2">st. Mary&#39;s University study econ then</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.329" end="00:03:16.819" style="s2">went off to Ottawa Carleton University</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.849" end="00:03:19.069" style="s2">to do a master&#39;s at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.819" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">you know from a very young age I you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.069" end="00:03:24.260" style="s2">know wanted to work in policy but</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:25.609" style="s2">specifically American policy and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:28.189" style="s2">this is actually general cultural thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.609" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">Canada is we&#39;re all kind of America</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.189" end="00:03:36.950" style="s2">watchers to some degree or another</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:40.069" style="s2">and in DC itself always felt like a kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:42.919" style="s2">of you know like an athenian or like</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.069" end="00:03:45.379" style="s2">room in like classical sidious fit not</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.919" end="00:03:48.379" style="s2">just by appearances but the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.379" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2">density of intellectual debate and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.379" end="00:03:54.409" style="s2">America as well my perspective was</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:03:56.799" style="s2">always always felt like a higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.409" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">variance country and by that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.799" end="00:04:03.409" style="s2">there&#39;s high highs low lows there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:06.229" style="s2">a lot of social consensus and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.409" end="00:04:10.129" style="s2">feeling of even if you know the politics</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.229" end="00:04:12.409" style="s2">is typify by gridlock that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.129" end="00:04:15.019" style="s2">could be another civil war or could we</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.409" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">could be a you know could have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.019" end="00:04:18.590" style="s2">renaissance it&#39;s always like right who</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">wears in Canada things work very well</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.590" end="00:04:22.630" style="s2">but very consensus-driven</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.860" style="s2">it&#39;s actually something I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:28.310" style="s2">America should try to emulate because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.860" end="00:04:30.979" style="s2">does lead to good outcomes but if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:33.590" style="s2">are in the world of policy and debate</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.979" end="00:04:35.330" style="s2">philosophy if you sort of feel like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.590" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">there&#39;s you know the end of history is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">common here not much to do anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">the end of history right I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:44.509" style="s2">put an end to that actually and well at</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:46.370" style="s2">the end of history or is that still a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.509" end="00:04:49.370" style="s2">thing I think history branched off and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.370" end="00:04:51.080" style="s2">and Canada is still still pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:53.930" style="s2">you know knows what it wants and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.080" end="00:04:56.090" style="s2">working pretty well and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.930" end="00:04:57.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve also you know what is it young and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:05:00.470" style="s2">I was big into you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.730" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">Christopher Hitchens and and those kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.470" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">of people and and sort of had a level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">romanticism for the you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.340" style="s2">life of that like a public intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:14.630" style="s2">right and but not just that that like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.340" end="00:05:15.800" style="s2">someone who&#39;s like I could actually but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.630" end="00:05:19.220" style="s2">changing things not just you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.800" end="00:05:21.760" style="s2">scribbling and so you know and it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.220" end="00:05:26.600" style="s2">also a very early you know big fan of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.760" end="00:05:28.790" style="s2">libertarian writing and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.600" end="00:05:31.760" style="s2">political philosophy of liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.790" end="00:05:35.000" style="s2">and also rationalism you know the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.760" end="00:05:38.150" style="s2">of less strong kind of overcoming bias</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.000" end="00:05:39.560" style="s2">kind of community and it was was always</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.150" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">fascinated by by George Mason University</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.560" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">in particular and one to want it to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:45.560" style="s2">there and not not necessarily for</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:47.720" style="s2">education but to be around that milieu</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.560" end="00:05:49.100" style="s2">of sort of the intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.720" end="00:05:51.650" style="s2">libertarian thinkers and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.100" end="00:05:54.770" style="s2">rationalist thinkers who are like</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.650" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">actually you know sort of like stepping</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.770" end="00:05:58.040" style="s2">outside of history and and been studying</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">it like an anthropologist or something</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.040" end="00:06:00.950" style="s2">like that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:02.420" style="s2">and so after I got my masters at</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.950" end="00:06:05.060" style="s2">Carleton I came and did a second</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.420" end="00:06:06.380" style="s2">master&#39;s at George Mason worked the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.060" end="00:06:09.710" style="s2">Makeda Center which was a research</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.380" end="00:06:11.750" style="s2">center attached to the school and just</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.710" end="00:06:14.420" style="s2">sort of dove headlong into public policy</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.750" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">and have unfortunately got hired at</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.420" end="00:06:21.020" style="s2">niskanen niskanen Center so we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:22.370" style="s2">of like you know people use all of words</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.020" end="00:06:25.970" style="s2">today we describe ourselves as moderate</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.370" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">but it&#39;s more like a it&#39;s not a split</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.970" end="00:06:30.530" style="s2">the difference Howard Schultz kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:32.600" style="s2">moderate it&#39;s it&#39;s we take from</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.530" end="00:06:35.690" style="s2">different buckets right so there may be</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.600" end="00:06:37.010" style="s2">some things that I think a OSE is right</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.690" end="00:06:40.250" style="s2">on and some things I think Mike Lee is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.010" end="00:06:44.210" style="s2">right on right and so so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.250" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">heterodox right heterodox or a or kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.210" end="00:06:53.720" style="s2">of you could say bipolar and and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:55.910" style="s2">specifically like our history at the</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.340" end="00:08:02.930" style="s2">hired it was partly because I had done a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.350" end="00:08:06.880" style="s2">lot of writing on on like the normative</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.550" end="00:08:27.760" style="s2">I came from I have I have the pedigree -</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.760" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">libertarian but was deviating on an</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.660" end="00:08:36.169" style="s2">issue like the well first you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:39.140" style="s2">classically liberal libertarians think</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.169" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">that you know we should yeah either</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.140" end="00:08:42.410" style="s2">taxation is theft or we should just go</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">back to some kind of like friendly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.410" end="00:08:47.930" style="s2">society well I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:49.700" style="s2">that attracted me to your writing was</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.930" end="00:08:51.500" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t really naeli down and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.700" end="00:08:52.850" style="s2">that I would read and be like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.500" end="00:08:55.810" style="s2">great then I&#39;d read the solar at the pen</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.810" end="00:09:00.860" style="s2">in this world where I think especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.490" end="00:09:02.570" style="s2">my audience and a lot of people I talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:05.840" style="s2">to we&#39;re sort of like in a post</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.570" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">libertarian world a lot of us at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.840" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">the in my sphere I think once identified</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.660" end="00:09:14.120" style="s2">as libertarian I myself went to George</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:15.800" style="s2">Mason - back in the 90s and and studied</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.120" end="00:09:18.650" style="s2">under some guys like Brian Kaplan who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.800" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">now very prominent writer and professor</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.650" end="00:09:22.380" style="s2">there at</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.899" style="s2">Mayson and so I was really indoctrinated</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.380" end="00:09:26.550" style="s2">into into the libertarian thinking and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.899" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">know a lot of my colleagues and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.550" end="00:09:30.660" style="s2">associates were too but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:32.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve all sort of all say maybe matured</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.660" end="00:09:36.149" style="s2">out of that or evolved out of that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.279" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">and I heard a critique thrown at some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.149" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">my friends like my friend will</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:42.839" style="s2">Chamberlain who runs a human events the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:45.230" style="s2">website and long-standing conservative</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.839" end="00:09:48.930" style="s2">publication they started calling us a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.230" end="00:09:51.149" style="s2">was it Mogga socialists which is an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.930" end="00:09:53.160" style="s2">interesting way of I think identifying</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.149" end="00:09:56.130" style="s2">the fact that we have begun to move</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.160" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">beyond just strictly strict libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.130" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">understanding of the world and are</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:05.370" style="s2">willing to entertain you know maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:07.170" style="s2">early Roosevelt sort of ideas on like</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.370" end="00:10:09.149" style="s2">how to how to marshal the economy in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.170" end="00:10:10.980" style="s2">such an order in order to you know come</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.149" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">to a greater good for everyone but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.980" end="00:10:15.029" style="s2">know with leaving the libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.830" style="s2">doctrine behind and so in reading your</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.029" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">work yeah you definitely have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.830" end="00:10:19.529" style="s2">pedigree you have and what I really</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.360" end="00:10:21.810" style="s2">enjoyed about your work and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.529" end="00:10:23.490" style="s2">to get into it is that you make your</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.810" end="00:10:25.230" style="s2">points but then you also put it very</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.490" end="00:10:28.020" style="s2">heavily into context and very heavily</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.230" end="00:10:30.300" style="s2">into political history contact local</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.020" end="00:10:32.910" style="s2">science context economic history and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.300" end="00:10:35.370" style="s2">economic context and you really draw</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.910" end="00:10:37.470" style="s2">very clear lines through the existing</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.370" end="00:10:39.660" style="s2">literature to come to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.470" end="00:10:41.730" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make today and the one</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.660" end="00:10:43.589" style="s2">piece that really stood out to me that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.730" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">read of yours well back I guess it was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.589" end="00:10:49.589" style="s2">late last year was an article called the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:52.200" style="s2">China Shock Doctrine and what appealed</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.589" end="00:10:54.390" style="s2">to me very much about that was in in my</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.200" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">book Democrats a deplorable I identified</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.390" end="00:10:59.550" style="s2">the Chinese ascension into the WTO and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:02.850" style="s2">the battle for Seattle and the World</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:05.400" style="s2">Trade the WTO protests and such as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.850" end="00:11:08.670" style="s2">really pivotal turning point for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.400" end="00:11:10.860" style="s2">of us who once had had supported the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.670" end="00:11:13.770" style="s2">Democratic policies and Democratic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.860" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">the neoliberal consensus Washington</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.770" end="00:11:20.940" style="s2">Consensus etc and then now was this man</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:23.670" style="s2">20 years 20 years later 20 years later</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.940" end="00:11:26.310" style="s2">we can look back at that moment and draw</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.670" end="00:11:28.020" style="s2">a straight line to here and see many of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.310" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">the negative consequences that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.020" end="00:11:32.290" style="s2">experiencing as a nation a culture as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.529" style="s2">an economy that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.290" end="00:11:37.480" style="s2">gave birth to the Trump moment the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.529" end="00:11:39.370" style="s2">movement and and so I really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.480" end="00:11:42.970" style="s2">dig into that because in particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.370" end="00:11:44.769" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s you take a very sharp</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.970" end="00:11:46.360" style="s2">look at a comparative advantage for</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.769" end="00:11:48.339" style="s2">example and that&#39;s something I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.360" end="00:11:50.769" style="s2">discuss and and for my regular listeners</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.339" end="00:11:52.360" style="s2">this one may be a little bit dirtier and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.769" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">a little bit wonky er than usual but</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.360" end="00:11:55.389" style="s2">trust me please stick with me we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.740" end="00:11:57.430" style="s2">gonna we&#39;re gonna tie it all together so</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.389" end="00:11:59.560" style="s2">we can understand how it relates to our</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.430" end="00:12:01.240" style="s2">world today because the main goal of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.560" end="00:12:03.190" style="s2">podcast is to try to help create a new</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.240" end="00:12:05.259" style="s2">mental model of the world because for</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.190" end="00:12:07.149" style="s2">most of us the the models the software</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.259" end="00:12:08.589" style="s2">that we were given as kids is just not</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.149" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">functioning right we&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.589" end="00:12:12.940" style="s2">process this new world but the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:14.709" style="s2">data&#39;s coming in and it&#39;s just not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.940" end="00:12:17.290" style="s2">not getting the right results so this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.709" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">part of that exploration so when we just</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.290" end="00:12:22.060" style="s2">get started right with the China shock</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.949" style="s2">thing and can you maybe tell us a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.060" end="00:12:25.779" style="s2">bit about its genesis why you decided to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.949" end="00:12:27.819" style="s2">write it and then we can just start</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.779" end="00:12:31.149" style="s2">working through you know your thesis and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.819" end="00:12:33.759" style="s2">and and the you know the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.149" end="00:12:35.410" style="s2">grand strategy for China which appears</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.759" end="00:12:36.819" style="s2">at least from my perspective and that of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.410" end="00:12:40.120" style="s2">some of my other guests including John</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.819" end="00:12:41.769" style="s2">rabe as to be a failed strategy and one</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.120" end="00:12:43.389" style="s2">that wherever we engage in this grand</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.769" end="00:12:45.790" style="s2">strategy we&#39;re just creating more</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.389" end="00:12:47.110" style="s2">problems so I&#39;d love to hear your take</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.790" end="00:12:50.290" style="s2">on that so let me just start with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.110" end="00:12:52.930" style="s2">that China Shock Doctrine in Nashville</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.290" end="00:12:55.329" style="s2">is a national affairs I think yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.930" end="00:12:57.310" style="s2">well I mean the genesis of it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.329" end="00:12:59.199" style="s2">really a kind of spiritual follow-up to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.310" end="00:13:02.170" style="s2">a piece of rope for the bulwark called</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.199" end="00:13:06.339" style="s2">the cost of trade of China and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.170" end="00:13:09.160" style="s2">argument I was having there you know you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.339" end="00:13:12.850" style="s2">know I am philosophically a free trader</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.160" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">I think you know globalization is good</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.850" end="00:13:17.529" style="s2">it should be pointed out that on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:21.540" style="s2">side of his I wear his glasses it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.529" end="00:13:24.730" style="s2">it&#39;s as globalist right which maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.540" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">that&#39;s something ironic yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.730" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a I think that the failure is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:34.990" style="s2">really an elite failure a failure to</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.629" end="00:13:57.430" style="s2">fruition there&#39;s a backlash and in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.329" end="00:13:58.569" style="s2">and so you know originally I have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.430" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">another paper called the free-market</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.569" end="00:14:03.550" style="s2">welfare state where you know I make the</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.339" end="00:14:14.110" style="s2">classic cases is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.810" end="00:14:15.790" style="s2">China shock where you know overnight you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.110" end="00:14:18.939" style="s2">know in a period of three years we shed</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.790" end="00:14:20.199" style="s2">two million manufacturing jobs in in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.939" end="00:14:23.430" style="s2">way that is very geographically</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.199" end="00:14:26.110" style="s2">concentrated where was that concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.430" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">Midwest and South Atlantic</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.110" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">you know furniture factories in North</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">Carolina and stuff like that and right</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:36.879" style="s2">and and you know in our models in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:38.110" style="s2">econ model textbook it&#39;s like yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.879" end="00:14:39.899" style="s2">there&#39;s gains from trade and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.110" end="00:14:41.980" style="s2">increase winners and losers but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.899" end="00:14:44.019" style="s2">winners outnumber the losers or at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.980" end="00:14:45.819" style="s2">you can redistribute but we often don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.019" end="00:14:48.699" style="s2">do the redistribute part right like we</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.819" end="00:14:50.680" style="s2">we say you know the pie will be bigger</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.699" end="00:14:52.629" style="s2">and so in principle we can make everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.680" end="00:14:54.610" style="s2">better off but we don&#39;t actually follow</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.629" end="00:14:57.699" style="s2">up and do the in principle we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.610" end="00:15:01.750" style="s2">right and and so there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.699" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">evidence that you know in European</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.750" end="00:15:06.970" style="s2">countries that underwent</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.949" style="s2">internationalization in the 90s places</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.970" end="00:15:11.379" style="s2">like the Scandinavian countries had had</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.949" end="00:15:13.389" style="s2">less of a populist backlash in part</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.379" end="00:15:15.100" style="s2">because they had you know robust</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.389" end="00:15:18.220" style="s2">reemployment programs for bust training</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.100" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">programs investments in supply chain to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.220" end="00:15:22.389" style="s2">to so for a displaced worker in one</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:23.649" style="s2">industry you could move into a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.389" end="00:15:27.579" style="s2">industry that&#39;s even higher productivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.649" end="00:15:29.470" style="s2">and we kind of only did half of that so</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.579" end="00:15:30.790" style="s2">we in a sense we only got half the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.470" end="00:15:33.220" style="s2">benefits of globalization right like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.790" end="00:15:36.670" style="s2">benefits of globalization or one that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.220" end="00:15:38.290" style="s2">you know you you know you have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.670" end="00:15:39.639" style="s2">comparative advantage that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.290" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">to talk about it but you know trading of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.639" end="00:15:42.910" style="s2">countries that have different relations</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">but the other half of that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.910" end="00:15:48.550" style="s2">international competition puts pressure</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:51.670" style="s2">on your domestic companies to compete to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.550" end="00:15:53.079" style="s2">be internationally competitive right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.670" end="00:15:55.720" style="s2">that can be good for productivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.079" end="00:15:57.670" style="s2">because that that will weed out the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.720" end="00:15:59.250" style="s2">underperformers and reward the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.670" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">higher performers and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.250" end="00:16:02.850" style="s2">concept like called export discipline</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:05.370" style="s2">like you have when you&#39;re competing</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.850" end="00:16:08.220" style="s2">globally you have no more more intense</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.370" end="00:16:09.500" style="s2">market discipline but we only get half</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:13.260" style="s2">the benefits because instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.500" end="00:16:15.450" style="s2">upgrading leveling up our firms the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.260" end="00:16:16.980" style="s2">export discipline just wiped out a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.450" end="00:16:19.620" style="s2">of firms right and so you had this</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.980" end="00:16:22.590" style="s2">massive offshoring so so the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.620" end="00:16:25.140" style="s2">perspective was you know we apply it a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.590" end="00:16:29.580" style="s2">kind of naive theory globalization that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.140" end="00:16:31.020" style="s2">was only only captured half the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.580" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">and also left a lot of workers behind</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.020" end="00:16:35.880" style="s2">because instead of retraining them or</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">giving them any level of 16 that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.880" end="00:16:41.400" style="s2">fell into disability insurance or onto</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">opiates and unemployment or maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.400" end="00:16:47.520" style="s2">became a Walmart greeter and and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:48.780" style="s2">was a an elite failure and so the piece</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.520" end="00:16:50.790" style="s2">I mentioned the cost of trade of China</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.780" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">it sort of begins with this anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.790" end="00:16:56.130" style="s2">that the economist Dani Rodrik has in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">one of his books the globalization</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.130" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">paradox where he was when he was writing</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:07.230" style="s2">that book it came out in 1999 he sent a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">draft Paul Krugman and Krugman read the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.230" end="00:17:12.660" style="s2">draft and responded Dani I can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.050" end="00:17:14.850" style="s2">any you know technical problems with</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.660" end="00:17:17.579" style="s2">your arguments but I feel if you put up</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.850" end="00:17:19.740" style="s2">this book that&#39;s critical globalization</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.579" end="00:17:21.300" style="s2">you are quote-unquote giving ammunition</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.740" end="00:17:25.100" style="s2">to the barbarians mmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.300" end="00:17:27.930" style="s2">right and and and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.100" end="00:17:29.850" style="s2">highlights part of the elite perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.930" end="00:17:31.710" style="s2">which was you know there are more</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.850" end="00:17:34.590" style="s2">there&#39;s more nuance to trading</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.710" end="00:17:36.540" style="s2">globalization than we like to admit but</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.590" end="00:17:39.450" style="s2">if we talk about it or if we make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.540" end="00:17:41.640" style="s2">overt then we give ammunition to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.450" end="00:17:44.220" style="s2">barbarians who will oppose it so we kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.640" end="00:17:46.200" style="s2">of have to give this this so he</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.220" end="00:17:48.540" style="s2">simplified version of it for political</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.200" end="00:17:50.610" style="s2">reasons and and my view is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.540" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">economists an economist job is not to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.610" end="00:17:56.850" style="s2">engage in strategic discourse is to tell</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:17:59.850" style="s2">the truth about what economics policy</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.850" end="00:18:03.290" style="s2">does so so economists especially the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.850" end="00:18:06.540" style="s2">were what went from being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.290" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">analysts or experts into more advocates</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.540" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">right and and I think that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:14.630" style="s2">the initial elite backlash is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:16.250" style="s2">we were sold a bill of goods right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:19.220" style="s2">let&#39;s just back up for a second so like</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.250" end="00:18:21.769" style="s2">in the late 1990s China wanted to obtain</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.220" end="00:18:23.740" style="s2">was a permanent normalized trade</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.769" end="00:18:26.509" style="s2">relation status with the United States</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.740" end="00:18:27.590" style="s2">there was big debates about it it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.509" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">around the same time that we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.590" end="00:18:32.830" style="s2">working on NAFTA as well and there was</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">just a general stampede towards reducing</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.830" end="00:18:38.509" style="s2">barriers to trade would boost reducing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.669" style="s2">barriers to capital flows across borders</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.509" end="00:18:43.250" style="s2">and the third component of that is also</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.669" end="00:18:45.500" style="s2">reducing barriers for people to move</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.250" end="00:18:48.169" style="s2">right so economic labor mobility is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.500" end="00:18:49.940" style="s2">really key component to and importantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.169" end="00:18:51.830" style="s2">political integration right political</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.940" end="00:18:53.330" style="s2">integration so this is the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.830" end="00:18:56.750" style="s2">daniel roderick is between globalization</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.330" end="00:18:58.340" style="s2">and hyperglobalisation okay so you drop</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.750" end="00:18:59.539" style="s2">trade barriers you drop tariffs on goods</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.340" end="00:19:02.179" style="s2">and services</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.539" end="00:19:04.039" style="s2">that&#39;s globalization there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.179" end="00:19:05.779" style="s2">really wrong with that but hyper</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.039" end="00:19:07.460" style="s2">globalization is when you when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.779" end="00:19:10.399" style="s2">picked all the low-hanging fruit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.460" end="00:19:12.649" style="s2">dropping tariffs and now to get more</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.399" end="00:19:15.559" style="s2">efficiency you have to rectify the fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.649" end="00:19:19.129" style="s2">that American tea kettles and British</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:21.830" style="s2">tea kettles have different voltages and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.129" end="00:19:24.429" style="s2">so you end up having to myrrh in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.830" end="00:19:27.019" style="s2">ways merge your regulatory regime</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.429" end="00:19:29.240" style="s2">because the the quote unquote non-tariff</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.019" end="00:19:31.909" style="s2">barriers of how things are regulated the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.240" end="00:19:34.309" style="s2">kind of product standardization the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.909" end="00:19:35.750" style="s2">different country has don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.309" end="00:19:36.980" style="s2">match between two countries so if an</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.750" end="00:19:39.529" style="s2">American company wants to sell tea</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.529" end="00:19:43.610" style="s2">have to have a separate product line</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:45.860" style="s2">right and and that kind of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.610" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">globalization is what drove you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.860" end="00:19:50.990" style="s2">these more super national institutions</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.340" style="s2">like the European Union where you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.990" end="00:19:55.539" style="s2">you know Commission&#39;s that are set up to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.340" end="00:19:58.639" style="s2">try to harmonize regulation across</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.539" end="00:20:04.690" style="s2">countries and in the u.s. context there</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.639" end="00:20:10.759" style="s2">really was in the late 90s a an active</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.580" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">this but in some senses it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.980" end="00:22:20.810" style="s2">is these were open secrets like there</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.170" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">there was journals of economic</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.270" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a barrier of language and</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:37.160" style="s2">information etc it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:38.780" style="s2">if now you understand it right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.160" end="00:22:41.180" style="s2">you know nobody nobody went to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.780" end="00:22:43.400" style="s2">Pennsylvania did they and said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.180" end="00:22:45.470" style="s2">gonna let China into the WTO and what</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.400" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">that means is like all these towns</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.470" end="00:22:51.470" style="s2">around here dead gone and guess what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:53.720" style="s2">also have this idea that you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.470" end="00:22:55.970" style="s2">just willing to up and move to wherever</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.720" end="00:22:57.470" style="s2">the new good job is somewhere but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.970" end="00:22:59.990" style="s2">we know that&#39;s actually not true either</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.470" end="00:23:01.580" style="s2">it&#39;s basically you&#39;re gonna stay and all</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.990" end="00:23:03.590" style="s2">the jobs the money are gonna leave and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.580" end="00:23:06.140" style="s2">then all of a sudden you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.590" end="00:23:09.410" style="s2">gonna be suffering from deaths of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.140" end="00:23:12.380" style="s2">despair drug abuse alcohol abuse etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.410" end="00:23:14.570" style="s2">and how are you guys down with that like</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.380" end="00:23:17.750" style="s2">nobody-nobody went and did that so</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.570" end="00:23:20.270" style="s2">there&#39;s like an opacity right between so</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.750" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s you say it&#39;s open but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.270" end="00:23:26.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the knowledge is there to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:28.790" style="s2">be fat like it as opposed to that these</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.330" end="00:23:31.250" style="s2">are all like hidden under the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.790" end="00:23:34.490" style="s2">under you know the Smithsonian or</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.250" end="00:23:36.980" style="s2">something right no exactly no I get it I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.490" end="00:23:39.110" style="s2">get it and you know I&#39;m not a huge fan</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.980" end="00:23:40.730" style="s2">of Alex Jones by any means and and it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.110" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">interesting how the pizza gate stuff did</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.730" end="00:23:45.710" style="s2">sort of presage the Epstein revelations</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:46.820" style="s2">or maybe that&#39;s what they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.710" end="00:23:48.650" style="s2">about in the first place I absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.820" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">have no idea I was just a common Pizza</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.650" end="00:23:53.450" style="s2">the other day I go there with my kids</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.570" end="00:23:55.700" style="s2">great pizza love that place I love that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.450" end="00:23:58.790" style="s2">place but back back to the China thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.700" end="00:24:00.890" style="s2">so the United States and I remember even</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.790" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">we were looking at the free trade area</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.890" end="00:24:06.140" style="s2">of the Americas back then but that died</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">with 2000 with 9/11 right like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.140" end="00:24:10.040" style="s2">focus on I used to be able to go between</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:11.780" style="s2">Canada in the US without a passport like</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.040" end="00:24:13.070" style="s2">super easy right they wanted you to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.780" end="00:24:15.500" style="s2">able to do that all the way down to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.070" end="00:24:19.490" style="s2">tip of Chile and and you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.500" end="00:24:21.410" style="s2">world where that isn&#39;t like ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.490" end="00:24:23.690" style="s2">and I&#39;ll put my cards on the table I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.410" end="00:24:26.600" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s actually a world</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.690" end="00:24:28.330" style="s2">worth moving to directionally right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.600" end="00:24:30.620" style="s2">just that there&#39;s a pace of change</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.330" end="00:24:32.390" style="s2">there&#39;s the level of buy-in and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.620" end="00:24:34.760" style="s2">communication with the public there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.390" end="00:24:37.309" style="s2">and this is why I sort of awe and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.760" end="00:24:39.470" style="s2">relates to how I write write I like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.309" end="00:24:40.700" style="s2">mentioned I I try to embed what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.470" end="00:24:42.860" style="s2">writing about the points I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:46.210" style="s2">make in some kind of historical flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.860" end="00:24:47.780" style="s2">some try to like retrace the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.210" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">dialectic that led</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.780" end="00:24:53.390" style="s2">to where we are now and and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">also should it should inform the way we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.390" end="00:24:59.780" style="s2">do policy where instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.330" end="00:25:02.810" style="s2">stand outside history and take a God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.780" end="00:25:05.000" style="s2">eye view as if we have like some skyhook</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.810" end="00:25:07.130" style="s2">to the through the moral foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.000" end="00:25:10.040" style="s2">the universe and prescribe what should</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.130" end="00:25:15.740" style="s2">happen like the these things are</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.040" end="00:25:17.630" style="s2">evolutionary and in a way the elite</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.740" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">failure and I get into this sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.630" end="00:25:23.930" style="s2">the final section of the china shop</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.830" end="00:25:26.690" style="s2">doctor and it was sort of applying a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.930" end="00:25:29.510" style="s2">theory that was fastly removed from</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.690" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">practice right and and the bigger that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.510" end="00:25:34.550" style="s2">gap is so so there&#39;s a theoretical case</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:37.970" style="s2">that we should have you know a global</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.550" end="00:25:40.100" style="s2">common market and there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.970" end="00:25:43.310" style="s2">getting there it might take a century</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.100" end="00:25:45.350" style="s2">and but but you know the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.310" end="00:25:46.970" style="s2">like the conte and arguments about like</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.350" end="00:25:48.950" style="s2">perpetual peace like there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.970" end="00:25:50.660" style="s2">lot of truth to that stuff like it would</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.950" end="00:25:52.970" style="s2">be great for China and for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.660" end="00:25:54.920" style="s2">the world to be as rich as us for us to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.970" end="00:25:58.370" style="s2">all be peaceable and to trade and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.920" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">travel the world but that that like we</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.370" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">can&#39;t force that isn&#39;t there a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.770" end="00:26:07.700" style="s2">presupposition in that statement that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:09.770" style="s2">every culture and society wants to be at</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.700" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">the end of the day peaceful and coexist</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.770" end="00:26:14.180" style="s2">with everybody is that I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:15.590" style="s2">that&#39;s true or not but isn&#39;t there an</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.180" end="00:26:17.660" style="s2">assumption built into there and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.590" end="00:26:20.630" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t sort of history</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.660" end="00:26:23.030" style="s2">say say otherwise and and wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.630" end="00:26:24.950" style="s2">looking at you know primates and other</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.030" end="00:26:28.010" style="s2">animals close to us would not say</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.950" end="00:26:30.830" style="s2">otherwise that you know conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.010" end="00:26:33.530" style="s2">violence and resource competition and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.830" end="00:26:36.470" style="s2">that sort of thing sort of innate innate</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.530" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">in us and we&#39;re prone to it yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.470" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">the it&#39;s it&#39;s the stuff of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:44.810" style="s2">right like it&#39;s I think this is also</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">like part of the you know psychological</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.810" end="00:26:47.780" style="s2">subtext to a statement like ammunition</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:51.670" style="s2">to the barbarians like yeah there really</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.780" end="00:26:51.670" style="s2">is like this this</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.270" end="00:27:00.150" style="s2">figurative but almost literal dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.060" end="00:27:03.660" style="s2">between the us the civilized and them</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.150" end="00:27:05.340" style="s2">the barbarians and but I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.660" end="00:27:07.740" style="s2">know building constructing a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.340" end="00:27:10.230" style="s2">civilization is all about taming those</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.740" end="00:27:13.470" style="s2">instincts yes and channeling in</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.230" end="00:27:16.440" style="s2">productive ways and while also</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.470" end="00:27:19.830" style="s2">preserving human particularity like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.440" end="00:27:22.170" style="s2">this is why you know maybe even in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.830" end="00:27:24.930" style="s2">globalized fully globalized world you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.170" end="00:27:26.430" style="s2">would still you know want to have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.930" end="00:27:29.220" style="s2">of heterogeneity because even one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.430" end="00:27:32.270" style="s2">one of the bigger you know it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.220" end="00:27:34.890" style="s2">the left critique of globalization was</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.270" end="00:27:37.740" style="s2">you know we&#39;re homogenizing the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.890" end="00:27:39.990" style="s2">right now you traveled to Tyson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.740" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">corners and then you go to Johannesburg</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.990" end="00:27:43.770" style="s2">and they look like the same place yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.930" style="s2">mean have you been to Singapore lately I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.770" end="00:27:47.430" style="s2">mean I was so bored out of my mind there</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.930" end="00:27:50.370" style="s2">because it was just like a combination</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.430" end="00:27:52.950" style="s2">of Miami and New York and something else</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.370" end="00:27:54.510" style="s2">it was we had to seek out the you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.950" end="00:27:56.850" style="s2">the novelty there because it was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.510" end="00:27:59.100" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the same you can go anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.850" end="00:28:00.990" style="s2">in the world now and I used to call it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.100" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">the Johnny Walker Black index you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.990" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">right you can get Johnny Walker walk</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:06.330" style="s2">anywhere and you can gauge the economic</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:08.010" style="s2">strength of the country based on how</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.330" end="00:28:09.830" style="s2">much that drink costs right</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.010" end="00:28:11.730" style="s2">at the same time if you&#39;re in Paris</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.830" end="00:28:15.870" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s probably has the best french</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.730" end="00:28:18.090" style="s2">fries so it&#39;s not all bad true there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.870" end="00:28:22.290" style="s2">just a balance right and and maybe being</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.090" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">Canadian I have a more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.290" end="00:28:26.940" style="s2">perspective on it like I&#39;m you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:29.220" style="s2">not so look there&#39;s a famous book in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.940" end="00:28:32.910" style="s2">Canada by a George Grant called lament</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.220" end="00:28:34.410" style="s2">of a nation he was writing a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.910" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">conservative writer in the red Tory</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.410" end="00:28:39.570" style="s2">tradition which are sort of like big</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:41.220" style="s2">government conservatives and today call</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.570" end="00:28:44.130" style="s2">it like a conservative populist</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.220" end="00:28:46.710" style="s2">nationalism and limit of a nation is</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.130" end="00:28:49.290" style="s2">like this prediction that because</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.710" end="00:28:53.400" style="s2">America is so big relative to Canada</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.290" end="00:28:56.310" style="s2">that our culture is going to be absent</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.400" end="00:28:57.990" style="s2">right and and that&#39;s why Canada you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.310" end="00:29:00.420" style="s2">to this day has content requirements</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:02.100" style="s2">where the radio station has to play you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.420" end="00:29:03.690" style="s2">know 16 percent of the plays have to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.100" end="00:29:04.790" style="s2">Justin Bieber because he&#39;s happened to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.690" end="00:29:07.490" style="s2">be born in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.790" end="00:29:09.560" style="s2">and and even now like Justin Trudeau is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.490" end="00:29:11.300" style="s2">talking is talking about how to enforce</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.560" end="00:29:14.860" style="s2">content requirements on stream streaming</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.300" end="00:29:19.420" style="s2">companies like Netflix and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.860" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">there the the pure anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.420" end="00:29:26.210" style="s2">anarcho-capitalist libertarian globalist</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:27.800" style="s2">economists would say that that&#39;s so an</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.210" end="00:29:29.300" style="s2">efficient like if we all want to watch</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.800" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">the Kardashians which is all watch the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.300" end="00:29:36.230" style="s2">Kardashians but there really is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:38.690" style="s2">trade-off right and and as a small L</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.230" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">liberal you know my I believe in</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.690" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">pluralism right and pluralism is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:48.140" style="s2">the inverse of homogeneous Asian right</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.090" end="00:29:51.140" style="s2">and and you know maybe there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.140" end="00:29:53.960" style="s2">economic you know quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.140" end="00:29:57.250" style="s2">efficiency costs to you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.960" end="00:30:00.890" style="s2">Canada having some level of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.250" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">protectionism right but maybe that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.890" end="00:30:07.910" style="s2">also essential to having a broader</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:10.460" style="s2">buy-in and also you know it&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.910" end="00:30:12.200" style="s2">if we&#39;re buying TVs from Mexico it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.460" end="00:30:15.320" style="s2">another thing if we&#39;re buying Mexican TV</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.200" end="00:30:17.390" style="s2">shows right well that things have so</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.320" end="00:30:19.430" style="s2">many interesting points I came across an</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.390" end="00:30:22.910" style="s2">article you did in quill at a few years</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.430" end="00:30:24.680" style="s2">ago referencing happiness hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.910" end="00:30:27.350" style="s2">Jonathan Hayden and you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.680" end="00:30:29.720" style="s2">he says that were 90% this giant</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.350" end="00:30:31.640" style="s2">elephant running through the streets 10%</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.720" end="00:30:33.380" style="s2">this little rider bouncing up on top</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.640" end="00:30:34.970" style="s2">hoping and praying we can just guide the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.380" end="00:30:36.590" style="s2">elephant to go where we want it to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.970" end="00:30:38.360" style="s2">and when it does go where we want it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.590" end="00:30:39.380" style="s2">go where like look we did that even</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.360" end="00:30:43.310" style="s2">though the hell that was gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.380" end="00:30:45.350" style="s2">wherever he wanted to go anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.310" end="00:30:47.180" style="s2">something that you had just said really</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.350" end="00:30:48.290" style="s2">triggered that and for me and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.180" end="00:30:49.820" style="s2">remember what it was because I was think</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.290" end="00:30:51.170" style="s2">about so many other things too on top of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.820" end="00:30:54.020" style="s2">it when you start talking about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.170" end="00:30:56.840" style="s2">cultural rationing in Canada and I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.020" end="00:30:58.430" style="s2">trying to think about how or why we may</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.840" end="00:31:00.680" style="s2">or may not want to do that in the United</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.430" end="00:31:03.080" style="s2">States and is there a same is there same</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.680" end="00:31:05.660" style="s2">argument to be made about cultural</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.080" end="00:31:09.230" style="s2">rationing as it were protectionism that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.660" end="00:31:11.060" style="s2">you made in Canada versus in it versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.230" end="00:31:13.610" style="s2">the United States would is there an</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.060" end="00:31:15.740" style="s2">argument to be made for that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.610" end="00:31:17.309" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say the US as a whole right</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.740" end="00:31:19.559" style="s2">because the US is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.309" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">cultural hegemon like you know we export</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.559" end="00:31:25.320" style="s2">Hollywood all around the world it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:29.429" style="s2">America is the beacon for like America</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.320" end="00:31:31.049" style="s2">has a robust national cultural place in</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.429" end="00:31:33.240" style="s2">the world and that&#39;s not going to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.049" end="00:31:36.029" style="s2">away like yeah everyone subscribing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.240" end="00:31:37.230" style="s2">Disney Plus right now but I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.230" end="00:31:41.789" style="s2">I think is those Indian guys isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">no it&#39;s PewDiePie but there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.789" end="00:31:47.370" style="s2">competition right between the two of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:50.340" style="s2">them yeah but you know I think to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.370" end="00:31:53.070" style="s2">extent this applies to the States is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.340" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">internal heterogeneity of the United</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.070" end="00:31:59.309" style="s2">States right so like and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:32:03.809" style="s2">cultural backlash the culture wars in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.309" end="00:32:07.110" style="s2">the u.s. is a kind of localized version</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.809" end="00:32:11.789" style="s2">of the same debate where there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.110" end="00:32:14.309" style="s2">in you know like a religious community</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.789" end="00:32:17.940" style="s2">in Missouri like feels like they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.309" end="00:32:19.769" style="s2">absolutely no cultural leverage in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.940" end="00:32:21.840" style="s2">modern world because everything is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.769" end="00:32:25.759" style="s2">dominated by New York and LA right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:29.220" style="s2">and so that that&#39;s also one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.759" end="00:32:31.619" style="s2">forces behind the realignment where you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.220" end="00:32:33.029" style="s2">know they have Antigua they had their</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.619" end="00:32:34.679" style="s2">adopting the left&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.029" end="00:32:36.499" style="s2">the old left&#39;s like globalization</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.679" end="00:32:38.730" style="s2">critique not just on economics but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.499" end="00:32:41.879" style="s2">the level of cultural feminine a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.730" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">modernization that&#39;s being that feels</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.879" end="00:32:45.049" style="s2">like it&#39;s being forced pushed under</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:48.690" style="s2">their throats because they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.049" end="00:32:51.659" style="s2">relatively limited you know market power</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.690" end="00:32:54.419" style="s2">right and you know consumers drive what</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.659" end="00:32:56.100" style="s2">Hollywood produces right like Nike you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.419" end="00:32:58.980" style="s2">know took the Betsy Ross flag off its</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:47.710" style="s2">after we went to the whole thing because</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.370" end="00:33:49.480" style="s2">we&#39;re on the subject now and you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.710" end="00:33:50.890" style="s2">in there that there was or maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.480" end="00:33:53.770" style="s2">in a different piece but you wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.890" end="00:33:56.110" style="s2">there was a difference between civil</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.770" end="00:33:58.299" style="s2">society and cultural identity and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.110" end="00:34:00.580" style="s2">wondering if you could expand on that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.299" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">there a meaningful difference does civil</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.580" end="00:34:06.730" style="s2">society come from our culture where does</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:09.099" style="s2">our culture come from do different</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.730" end="00:34:10.929" style="s2">populations have different ideas or a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.099" end="00:34:12.820" style="s2">civil society should look like is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.929" end="00:34:14.230" style="s2">separate from their cultural identity I</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.820" end="00:34:15.909" style="s2">think this is something that people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.230" end="00:34:18.190" style="s2">really grappling with right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.909" end="00:34:20.889" style="s2">like where does our actual civil society</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.190" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">come from does it come from our culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.889" end="00:34:24.310" style="s2">where does our culture come from it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:27.340" style="s2">comes from us and what is who are we we</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.310" end="00:34:29.889" style="s2">are the elephant yeah by civil society I</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.340" end="00:34:33.099" style="s2">really mean like civic society like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.889" end="00:34:35.849" style="s2">the state right so I think the best way</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.099" end="00:34:38.139" style="s2">to get this issue is to contrast the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.849" end="00:34:40.210" style="s2">contrast the multicultural policies of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.139" end="00:34:43.000" style="s2">Canada with the United States so can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.210" end="00:34:45.310" style="s2">so the United States has this this self</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.000" end="00:34:47.530" style="s2">identity as a melting pot right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.310" end="00:34:50.859" style="s2">multiculturalism in the u.s. context is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.530" end="00:34:52.839" style="s2">is really a kind of homogenate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.859" end="00:34:55.500" style="s2">really a kind of monoculture like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.839" end="00:35:00.010" style="s2">about you know having black brown and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.500" end="00:35:02.470" style="s2">every color person be represented but we</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.010" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">are all going to you know be pulled into</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.470" end="00:35:07.720" style="s2">one sort of one one nation culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:09.970" style="s2">would like the Civic nationalist idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.720" end="00:35:11.560" style="s2">right well I think this is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.970" end="00:35:13.150" style="s2">called like one nation conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.560" end="00:35:16.630" style="s2">right or one one caught one nation</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.150" end="00:35:20.260" style="s2">culture and and that that that has its</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.630" end="00:35:21.940" style="s2">roots and you know the relative you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.260" end="00:35:24.970" style="s2">you know that the thirteen colonies were</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.940" end="00:35:27.670" style="s2">diverse but historically America has</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.970" end="00:35:31.480" style="s2">been was dominated by like this white</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.670" end="00:35:35.020" style="s2">anglo-saxon culture to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.480" end="00:35:37.450" style="s2">not dominated I mean created by yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.020" end="00:35:39.369" style="s2">literally created by let&#39;s not use I</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.450" end="00:35:40.610" style="s2">think dominated for a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.369" end="00:35:42.290" style="s2">listeners they&#39;ll hear that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.610" end="00:35:45.080" style="s2">dominate it and be like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.290" end="00:35:46.700" style="s2">negative thing well it&#39;s product of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.080" end="00:35:50.180" style="s2">but I mean it&#39;s literally both like</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.700" end="00:35:53.060" style="s2">wasps wasps are for the elite I you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.180" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">they&#39;re they used to restrict Jews and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.060" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">and polish people from and Catholics</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.520" style="s2">from going to their Ivy League school so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:35:59.990" style="s2">there was a level of actual doubt on two</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.520" end="00:36:03.980" style="s2">of the three of those accounts there so</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.990" end="00:36:06.770" style="s2">alright so like and because America had</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.980" end="00:36:10.970" style="s2">this you know the the scots-irish for</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.770" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">example you know they they are if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.970" end="00:36:16.430" style="s2">ever read like Albion seed that book you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:19.640" style="s2">know they&#39;re they were the first sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.430" end="00:36:21.560" style="s2">ethnic white population to lose the -</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.640" end="00:36:24.590" style="s2">right they they just became white right</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.560" end="00:36:27.830" style="s2">and then over time the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.590" end="00:36:29.690" style="s2">Irish and the the polish and Italian</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.830" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">immigrants like they they all assimilate</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.690" end="00:36:35.900" style="s2">into sort of one identity right and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:40.120" style="s2">in Canada it&#39;s a very different very</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.900" end="00:36:42.590" style="s2">different sort of policy are we have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.120" end="00:36:44.360" style="s2">an official multicultural policy but</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.590" end="00:36:46.940" style="s2">it&#39;s really a policy of accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.360" end="00:36:49.250" style="s2">right so and this this has roots in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.940" end="00:36:52.100" style="s2">fact that Canada was settled both by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.250" end="00:36:54.950" style="s2">English but also by the Acadian French</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.100" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">and to this you know within our</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.950" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">lifetimes Quebec has tried to separate</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:03.590" style="s2">from Canada and they they really are a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:07.850" style="s2">nation within a country right so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.590" end="00:37:10.310" style="s2">can&#39;t have a one nation policy one one</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.850" end="00:37:12.770" style="s2">culture policy in Canada we from day one</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.310" end="00:37:14.630" style="s2">we were bifurcated because there was</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.770" end="00:37:16.790" style="s2">genuine cultural differences and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.630" end="00:37:18.830" style="s2">both sides didn&#39;t want to assimilate to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.790" end="00:37:22.550" style="s2">the other right and so that led to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.830" end="00:37:24.590" style="s2">kind of pluralism that was ingrained in</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.550" end="00:37:26.170" style="s2">our system our federal system right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.590" end="00:37:28.760" style="s2">and this this ended up being</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.170" end="00:37:32.030" style="s2">extrapolated to our immigration policy</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.760" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">as well so you know wait how does it how</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.030" end="00:37:35.720" style="s2">does that mean and first of all just</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:38.030" style="s2">just reminder I mean it quote worked</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.720" end="00:37:40.520" style="s2">except for the fact that the cable quad</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.030" end="00:37:42.770" style="s2">tried to secede from yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.520" end="00:37:45.860" style="s2">yeah they succeeded how&#39;d it did it</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.770" end="00:37:48.140" style="s2">really work well this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.860" end="00:37:49.550" style="s2">another another difference between can</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.140" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">in the u.s. like the the history</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.550" end="00:37:53.150" style="s2">secession in the United States is so</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:55.510" style="s2">tinged with with states rights and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.150" end="00:37:58.270" style="s2">racism and slave</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.510" end="00:38:01.180" style="s2">that in the way it&#39;s not in Canada and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.270" end="00:38:02.620" style="s2">so there is like this you know the herp</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.180" end="00:38:04.270" style="s2">the Albert Hirschman exit voice and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.620" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">loyalty sort of theory where like</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.270" end="00:38:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s different ways you can influence</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">an organization you can have voice in it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.600" end="00:38:11.230" style="s2">you can be democratic and and and put</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:12.130" style="s2">your opinions out there or you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.230" end="00:38:14.380" style="s2">threaten exit</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.130" end="00:38:15.940" style="s2">you can stop buying a product because</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.380" end="00:38:19.150" style="s2">that you don&#39;t like what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.940" end="00:38:22.750" style="s2">and exit is a really important part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.150" end="00:38:26.860" style="s2">what you know keeps a country responsive</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.750" end="00:38:29.350" style="s2">right like and and so yes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.860" end="00:38:33.340" style="s2">alternative world or a Quebec left and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.350" end="00:38:36.610" style="s2">we&#39;d have had like a brexit and Canada</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.340" end="00:38:40.060" style="s2">would be literally divided in half but</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.610" end="00:38:45.540" style="s2">in in some way like the optimal is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.060" end="00:38:50.590" style="s2">have that active threat of like a a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.540" end="00:38:55.060" style="s2">viable like real threat of exit that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.590" end="00:38:57.940" style="s2">never actually gets enacted because just</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.060" end="00:39:00.990" style="s2">having that threat enforces a level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.940" end="00:39:04.660" style="s2">federalism and pluralism and negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.990" end="00:39:07.360" style="s2">that keeps the system sort of responsive</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.660" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">to those those deeper things and and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.360" end="00:39:11.380" style="s2">just to explain how this affects our</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:13.840" style="s2">integration policies of Canada has an</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.380" end="00:39:17.940" style="s2">explicit accommodationist policy of</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.840" end="00:39:20.680" style="s2">immigration so you know our view is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.940" end="00:39:23.620" style="s2">that you know new immigrants have to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.680" end="00:39:26.440" style="s2">know assimilate in a very deep sense to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.620" end="00:39:27.850" style="s2">Canadian culture we instead of having a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.440" end="00:39:31.510" style="s2">melting pot sometimes it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.850" end="00:39:35.890" style="s2">mosaic right we have you know general</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.510" end="00:39:37.840" style="s2">genuine you know genuine</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.890" end="00:39:41.470" style="s2">multiculturalism in a sense where your</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.840" end="00:39:43.000" style="s2">local ethnic identity is your Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.470" end="00:39:45.430" style="s2">but you&#39;re also Hindu right like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.000" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">have the - we never had we didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.430" end="00:39:49.450" style="s2">don&#39;t have an ideology of dropping the -</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.540" style="s2">and the the Canadian part of the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.450" end="00:39:54.100" style="s2">is less thick it&#39;s more about your your</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.540" end="00:39:55.420" style="s2">civic involvement more about if you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.100" end="00:39:57.220" style="s2">participate in democracy and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.420" end="00:39:58.690" style="s2">participate in the state so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.220" end="00:40:02.680" style="s2">biggest sort of turning points on this</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.690" end="00:40:06.320" style="s2">was in the late 90s when you know can</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.680" end="00:40:11.210" style="s2">has a large Sikh population and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.320" end="00:40:12.770" style="s2">a Sikh man wanted to join the RCMP the</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.770" end="00:40:19.400" style="s2">RCMP is kind of like our our Federal</p>

<p begin="00:40:19.400" end="00:40:26.660" style="s2">you know red with with these these uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.150" end="00:40:30.080" style="s2">funny hats and obviously Sikhs wear</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.660" end="00:40:34.070" style="s2">turbans and so the question was can a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.080" end="00:40:35.600" style="s2">Sikh joined the RCMP and if so do we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.070" end="00:40:37.730" style="s2">we going to force him to remove his</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.600" end="00:40:40.760" style="s2">turban and so this created a big</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.730" end="00:40:44.450" style="s2">controversy at the time and the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.760" end="00:40:47.420" style="s2">conclusion was no we have to accommodate</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.450" end="00:40:49.160" style="s2">that right and and that actually leads</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.420" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">to better integration in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.160" end="00:40:54.250" style="s2">right if you if you force assimilation</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:57.260" style="s2">as your policy then you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.250" end="00:41:00.500" style="s2">resistance but if you&#39;re focused more on</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.260" end="00:41:01.460" style="s2">civic integration then people from</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.500" end="00:41:04.630" style="s2">different backgrounds and communities</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.460" end="00:41:06.860" style="s2">and cultural identities feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.630" end="00:41:09.310" style="s2">coming out of their home coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.860" end="00:41:11.450" style="s2">their community joining in civil society</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.310" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">because they they don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.450" end="00:41:16.910" style="s2">they&#39;re there they don&#39;t have to give up</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.470" style="s2">their cultural identity to to do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:21.350" style="s2">well and what is it here in the United</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.470" end="00:41:24.070" style="s2">States I think here in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.350" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s more an ideology of of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.070" end="00:41:29.270" style="s2">cultural assimilation really and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:30.980" style="s2">it&#39;s you know derivative derivative that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.270" end="00:41:32.930" style="s2">anglo-saxon Protestant sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.980" end="00:41:34.790" style="s2">philosophy a more Universal</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.930" end="00:41:39.370" style="s2">universalistic philosophy I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.790" end="00:41:44.570" style="s2">also reflected in you know the way the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.370" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">cultural left has has become very you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.570" end="00:41:50.780" style="s2">know the intolerance of intolerance</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">right like whereas in Canada you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.780" end="00:41:54.500" style="s2">one of the funny like coalition&#39;s has</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:56.210" style="s2">formed you can&#39;t the Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.500" end="00:41:59.720" style="s2">Conservative Party has a very large</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.210" end="00:42:01.550" style="s2">immigrant constituency in part for very</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.720" end="00:42:02.690" style="s2">obvious reasons like if you have if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.550" end="00:42:03.910" style="s2">support more if you&#39;re a Christian and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.690" end="00:42:06.860" style="s2">support more traditional family values</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.910" end="00:42:08.990" style="s2">you have a lot in common with the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.860" end="00:42:11.900" style="s2">Indonesian immigrant who just got off</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.990" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">the boat and doesn&#39;t know you know they</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.900" end="00:42:15.830" style="s2">they they don&#39;t they&#39;re they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.830" end="00:42:19.630" style="s2">stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.790" end="00:42:22.670" style="s2">and so you end up having these odd</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.230" end="00:42:25.250" style="s2">bedfellows where like for example when</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.670" end="00:42:28.100" style="s2">Ontario was trying to pass a a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.250" end="00:42:30.290" style="s2">progressive sex ed curriculum you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.100" end="00:42:33.020" style="s2">you had Christian conservatives and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.290" end="00:42:36.100" style="s2">immigrant community joining forces on</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.020" end="00:42:37.820" style="s2">that and and the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.100" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">accommodation we have we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.820" end="00:42:42.170" style="s2">genuine pluralism and and genuine</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:44.920" style="s2">pluralism we you know it&#39;s based on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.170" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">fact that our based on the premise that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.920" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">even if you think there&#39;s a right answer</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">you know and I and I we all have our own</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">comprehensive moral views about what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:56.750" style="s2">right answer is you can&#39;t impose that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t because imposing that is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.750" end="00:42:59.510" style="s2">kind of domination right right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:01.550" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re saying is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.510" end="00:43:04.580" style="s2">Civic Society there gets made up from</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.550" end="00:43:06.320" style="s2">whoever shows up on the boat right you</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.580" end="00:43:07.700" style="s2">have to accommodate all these views and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.320" end="00:43:10.820" style="s2">you have to integrate all these new</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.700" end="00:43:13.340" style="s2">views so basically it&#39;s like by numbers</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.820" end="00:43:15.770" style="s2">right well that&#39;s what I mean by mosaic</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.340" end="00:43:18.110" style="s2">right it&#39;s you you stand back far enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.770" end="00:43:20.060" style="s2">from a mosaic it looks like it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.110" end="00:43:22.520" style="s2">blended together yeah but that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.060" end="00:43:23.900" style="s2">different from literally you know having</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.520" end="00:43:26.510" style="s2">a melting pot where everything becomes</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.900" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">fondue you know I&#39;m grappling with that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.510" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">one a little bit because it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:33.710" style="s2">if there&#39;s a loud enough faction on any</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:36.530" style="s2">number of issues they would become</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.710" end="00:43:38.870" style="s2">integrated into your civic society I</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.530" end="00:43:41.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know that people in the United</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.870" end="00:43:43.160" style="s2">States are open-minded like that am I</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.750" end="00:43:45.170" style="s2">seeing this wrong let me give you the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.160" end="00:43:47.240" style="s2">counter example so that this this the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.170" end="00:43:50.060" style="s2">this mosaic policy that I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.240" end="00:43:52.220" style="s2">describing in Canada the exception is go</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.060" end="00:43:54.410" style="s2">back because Quebec has a very thick</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.220" end="00:43:59.570" style="s2">cultural identity right they are French</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.410" end="00:44:01.010" style="s2">and they are Catholic and they even</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.570" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">though you know since the 60s they</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:07.160" style="s2">become very secular they they retain</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:10.520" style="s2">that kind of French more rationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.160" end="00:44:12.830" style="s2">view of assimilation right like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.520" end="00:44:15.830" style="s2">French policy of assimilation is is kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.830" end="00:44:19.630" style="s2">of parallels in Quebec and in the last</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.830" end="00:44:23.570" style="s2">decade there was this initiative</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.630" end="00:44:27.470" style="s2">advanced by the the parti québécois</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.570" end="00:44:31.220" style="s2">which is the sort of more nationalist</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.470" end="00:44:33.180" style="s2">party in Quebec that the they call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.220" end="00:44:36.119" style="s2">the the values Charter</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.180" end="00:44:38.130" style="s2">and if this had passed it did pass but</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.119" end="00:44:43.230" style="s2">it was struck down by our Constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.130" end="00:44:45.809" style="s2">Court it would require it would ban</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.230" end="00:44:48.529" style="s2">religious religious garb of any kind in</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.809" end="00:44:51.859" style="s2">public places right and this was</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.529" end="00:44:51.859" style="s2">transparently a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.039" end="00:45:00.809" style="s2">a form of discrimination against Muslims</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.940" end="00:45:03.299" style="s2">who were headdresses and so on and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.809" end="00:45:04.680" style="s2">that isn&#39;t the opposite of what I&#39;m sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.299" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">of describing that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.680" end="00:45:09.750" style="s2">forced form of sort of rationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:12.270" style="s2">assimilation and and you know I&#39;ve joked</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.750" end="00:45:14.549" style="s2">before that like you know progressivism</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.270" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">the current mode of progressivism er</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.549" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">currently and like it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:21.690" style="s2">version of that right like a you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.490" style="s2">it&#39;s only a matter of time before you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.690" end="00:45:26.970" style="s2">know Bill Maher&#39;s president and bans the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.490" end="00:45:31.289" style="s2">burqa right and and I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.970" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">trend to see how you know the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.289" end="00:45:36.390" style="s2">side of progressivism is of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:38.789" style="s2">alienating to you know a six-year-old in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.390" end="00:45:42.750" style="s2">Kentucky it&#39;s also potentially very</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.789" end="00:45:45.210" style="s2">alienating to the you know the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.750" end="00:45:47.069" style="s2">family man from you&#39;ve just moved here</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.210" end="00:45:50.190" style="s2">from Mexico right like definitely right</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.069" end="00:45:52.049" style="s2">and and that is a kind of myopia that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.190" end="00:45:54.599" style="s2">think the left is doesn&#39;t have because</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.049" end="00:45:59.400" style="s2">they they don&#39;t because of this this</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.599" end="00:46:01.170" style="s2">American Protestant assimilationist a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.400" end="00:46:02.730" style="s2">you know way of looking at the world</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.650" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a false dichotomy right</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.240" end="00:46:14.970" style="s2">like like you you can accommodate people</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:16.829" style="s2">who are traditional family values even</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.970" end="00:46:18.839" style="s2">if you don&#39;t you yourself don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.829" end="00:46:20.279" style="s2">in them I&#39;m digging through my notes</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.839" end="00:46:21.750" style="s2">here because you brought up something</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.279" end="00:46:23.130" style="s2">that I wanted to talk to you about too</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.750" end="00:46:24.180" style="s2">and I promise we&#39;ll get back to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.130" end="00:46:26.490" style="s2">China thing because I think it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.180" end="00:46:30.920" style="s2">important but you made a connection</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.490" end="00:46:33.000" style="s2">between social justice activism and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.920" end="00:46:34.920" style="s2">Protestantism is that right did I get</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.000" end="00:46:37.319" style="s2">that right yeah yeah I think can you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.920" end="00:46:39.390" style="s2">explain that to me because as I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.319" end="00:46:43.860" style="s2">that down I thought to myself I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.390" end="00:46:47.320" style="s2">understand this well</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.860" end="00:46:49.060" style="s2">you know I think a and you know maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.320" end="00:46:53.530" style="s2">might be sort of out of my depth here</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.060" end="00:46:55.390" style="s2">but there&#39;s a universalistic strain in</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.530" end="00:46:58.330" style="s2">Christianity right there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.390" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">more particular istic strain like if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.330" end="00:47:05.260" style="s2">think Orthodox but then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:08.680" style="s2">this more universalistic strain which i</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.260" end="00:47:10.450" style="s2">think is is even as America secular</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.680" end="00:47:13.690" style="s2">Rises is still part of the</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.170" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">talking about is the sense of building</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.300" end="00:47:28.930" style="s2">the kingdom of God on earth</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:31.510" style="s2">and yeah this broader sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.930" end="00:47:37.180" style="s2">cosmopolitan equality and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.510" end="00:47:38.890" style="s2">is in ways downstream of a kind of white</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.180" end="00:47:44.110" style="s2">anglo-saxon form of Protestantism in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.890" end="00:47:49.690" style="s2">way that isn&#39;t it it&#39;s very uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.110" end="00:47:52.600" style="s2">American in that sense like there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.690" end="00:47:54.310" style="s2">know the cultural views the way the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.600" end="00:47:56.080" style="s2">you know different countries in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.310" end="00:47:58.360" style="s2">see these things or you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.080" end="00:48:00.340" style="s2">there&#39;s also a parallel here to why like</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.360" end="00:48:02.380" style="s2">a lot of the you know populist</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.340" end="00:48:05.080" style="s2">nationalist governments in Central</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.380" end="00:48:07.420" style="s2">Europe are also you know like the Polish</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.420" end="00:48:15.910" style="s2">kind of Catholic nationalist party</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.350" end="00:48:18.280" style="s2">because I think there&#39;s just this sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.910" end="00:48:21.130" style="s2">of underlying Catholic Protestant you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.280" end="00:48:22.630" style="s2">know war religion that that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.130" end="00:48:24.520" style="s2">taking place in the subtext even though</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.630" end="00:48:27.490" style="s2">we don&#39;t use those terms but those are</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.520" end="00:48:29.800" style="s2">the the kind of the deaths that like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.490" end="00:48:33.490" style="s2">genealogy of those ideas even if even if</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.800" end="00:48:35.980" style="s2">we detach them from theology so wasps</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.490" end="00:48:37.240" style="s2">equal sjw&#39;s that&#39;s this is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.980" end="00:48:39.820" style="s2">taking away from this there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.240" end="00:48:41.740" style="s2">direct line you can draw you think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.820" end="00:48:44.590" style="s2">like literally like that that&#39;s the you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.740" end="00:48:45.850" style="s2">know the wasps ran the Ivy League&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.590" end="00:48:50.110" style="s2">that that&#39;s emanating from the Ivy</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:11.630" style="s2">of even evangelicalism right like and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.859" end="00:49:13.970" style="s2">these parallels aren&#39;t aren&#39;t to falsify</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.630" end="00:49:15.500" style="s2">or to negate those few searches it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.970" end="00:49:18.410" style="s2">just that&#39;s actually what the historical</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.500" end="00:49:20.059" style="s2">context is even even something like you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.410" end="00:49:22.220" style="s2">know the effective altruism movement I</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.059" end="00:49:25.309" style="s2">was gonna bring that out yes well uh you</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.220" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">know John Gray the the writer and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.309" end="00:49:29.210" style="s2">philosopher he has a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:31.279" style="s2">seven types of atheism where he the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.210" end="00:49:32.990" style="s2">whole point of that book is to say you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.279" end="00:49:36.099" style="s2">know let&#39;s not just have the new atheist</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.990" end="00:49:40.339" style="s2">like Sam Harrison and Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.099" end="00:49:41.900" style="s2">define atheism the there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.339" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">different ways to be an atheist and a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.900" end="00:49:48.410" style="s2">non-believer you can be into Spinoza or</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:50.839" style="s2">you know you can be a Buddhist and he</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.410" end="00:49:53.420" style="s2">identifies like secular humanism right</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.839" end="00:49:55.849" style="s2">the kind of new atheist creed is really</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.420" end="00:50:01.730" style="s2">a kind of monotheism that has the has</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.849" end="00:50:04.730" style="s2">dropped the label God right it&#39;s and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.730" end="00:50:09.380" style="s2">and in in it seeks converts right but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.730" end="00:50:11.329" style="s2">also it also is you know you could be</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.380" end="00:50:14.660" style="s2">traced historically from you know a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.329" end="00:50:17.210" style="s2">Augustus or comped you know comped</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.660" end="00:50:21.079" style="s2">was the first person to coined the word</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.210" end="00:50:23.240" style="s2">altruism and this was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.079" end="00:50:28.029" style="s2">Enlightenment where you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.240" end="00:50:31.430" style="s2">becoming enlightened and we see the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.029" end="00:50:32.930" style="s2">natural religion or the natural science</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.430" end="00:50:34.789" style="s2">the philosophy have kind of refuted</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.930" end="00:50:36.920" style="s2">religion and now we need to construct a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.789" end="00:50:39.559" style="s2">new religion right and compt called his</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.920" end="00:50:42.680" style="s2">religion altruism and they would where</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.559" end="00:50:43.970" style="s2">they literally would wear tunics that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.680" end="00:50:45.740" style="s2">could only be buttoned up in the back</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.970" end="00:50:50.839" style="s2">because then you&#39;d have to have someone</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.740" end="00:50:53.809" style="s2">help you right and this this sir</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.839" end="00:50:56.900" style="s2">self-sacrificing mentality really is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.809" end="00:50:59.210" style="s2">kind of Christian morality like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.900" end="00:51:01.250" style="s2">you can read in each other on Randy</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.210" end="00:51:02.810" style="s2">you want confirmation to that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.250" end="00:51:04.460" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that isn&#39;t invalidating</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.810" end="00:51:06.410" style="s2">maybe that more maybe that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.460" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">that is the culture we have we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.410" end="00:51:12.110" style="s2">operate in that culture but we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:14.990" style="s2">can&#39;t you&#39;re deluding yourself if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.110" end="00:51:17.690" style="s2">think the cultural presuppositions that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.990" end="00:51:19.730" style="s2">you have just came from X Neil oh now</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.690" end="00:51:22.580" style="s2">that they are deeply embedded in history</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.730" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">and this this this also goes back to why</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.580" end="00:51:27.250" style="s2">you can&#39;t force things you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:29.560" style="s2">more evolutionary approach because</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.250" end="00:51:32.270" style="s2">because these things evolve like they</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.560" end="00:51:36.550" style="s2">everything everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.270" end="00:51:36.550" style="s2">today has some piece of the past in it</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.150" end="00:51:43.100" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating I mean my audience me</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.190" end="00:51:45.980" style="s2">no no stranger to the notion that social</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.100" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">justice warriors are what the Claremont</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.980" end="00:51:50.090" style="s2">Institute is now calling</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:52.100" style="s2">multiculturalism or identity politics or</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.090" end="00:51:54.920" style="s2">whatever the case may be that has has a</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.100" end="00:51:55.910" style="s2">religious element to it for sure in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.920" end="00:51:57.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about that quite a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.910" end="00:51:59.210" style="s2">bit it&#39;s been a great awakening right</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.980" end="00:52:00.950" style="s2">like America has had these great</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.210" end="00:52:03.560" style="s2">awakenings these Protestant evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.950" end="00:52:05.960" style="s2">awakenings in his history and today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.560" end="00:52:08.750" style="s2">it&#39;s the Great Awakening and we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.960" end="00:52:10.730" style="s2">of missing the fact that you know it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.750" end="00:52:12.380" style="s2">the exact structure of past Great</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.730" end="00:52:15.380" style="s2">Awakenings is it came on very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.380" end="00:52:19.070" style="s2">caught people off guard it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.380" end="00:52:20.810" style="s2">evangelical and and and isn&#39;t and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.070" end="00:52:23.960" style="s2">know wrapped up in all these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.810" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">rituals and social rituals and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.960" end="00:52:30.010" style="s2">because it is nominally secular it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:32.360" style="s2">the exact same sort of sociological</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.010" end="00:52:34.040" style="s2">phenomena right oh and they operate in</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.360" end="00:52:35.600" style="s2">this similar way and you said that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.040" end="00:52:38.090" style="s2">they&#39;re seeking converts and they also</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.600" end="00:52:39.860" style="s2">seek out to destroy apostates of which</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.090" end="00:52:42.140" style="s2">one that that&#39;s what I am I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.860" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">apostate that&#39;s a former Democrat and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.140" end="00:52:46.610" style="s2">you know and I want to reiterate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:49.340" style="s2">this isn&#39;t I&#39;m not saying this as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.610" end="00:52:51.740" style="s2">polemic against social justice I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.340" end="00:52:53.240" style="s2">you can make it the exact same genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.740" end="00:52:56.810" style="s2">not it be a different genealogy for</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.240" end="00:52:58.730" style="s2">everything right and and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.810" end="00:53:01.700" style="s2">I&#39;m really against is is lack of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.730" end="00:53:04.010" style="s2">self-awareness yeah I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.700" end="00:53:07.130" style="s2">we can we can definitely agree on that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.010" end="00:53:09.710" style="s2">had a conversation with a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.130" end="00:53:10.609" style="s2">and a missionary psychologist beau</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.710" end="00:53:13.789" style="s2">Winegard</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.609" end="00:53:17.210" style="s2">from Hillsdale I think he was on and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.789" end="00:53:21.140" style="s2">were talking about different populations</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.210" end="00:53:23.509" style="s2">having certain proclivities towards or</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.140" end="00:53:25.819" style="s2">an appreciation for different types of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.509" end="00:53:27.650" style="s2">political organization or political</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.819" end="00:53:32.150" style="s2">structures do you think that there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.650" end="00:53:35.960" style="s2">connection between our evolution as an</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.150" end="00:53:38.690" style="s2">animal and who we are where we evolved</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.960" end="00:53:40.460" style="s2">what sort of contained spheres we</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.690" end="00:53:42.619" style="s2">evolved in and then what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.460" end="00:53:46.999" style="s2">political system that we can either</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.619" end="00:53:48.739" style="s2">appreciate or endure and if there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.999" end="00:53:50.329" style="s2">those kind of differences what happens</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.739" end="00:53:52.940" style="s2">when you put them together in the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.329" end="00:53:55.849" style="s2">place and then ask for us to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.940" end="00:54:00.049" style="s2">or you know create a mosaic or turn</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.849" end="00:54:01.489" style="s2">everybody into fondue no absolutely you</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.049" end="00:54:03.109" style="s2">know I think it&#39;s almost the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.489" end="00:54:07.160" style="s2">conservatism to say that human nature is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.109" end="00:54:09.769" style="s2">really binding constraint on society and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.160" end="00:54:11.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say we can&#39;t modulate or</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.769" end="00:54:14.749" style="s2">mediate human nature to produce</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.650" end="00:54:16.460" style="s2">civilizations that are productive and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.749" end="00:54:19.670" style="s2">transcend like tribalism and stuff like</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.039" end="00:54:41.869" style="s2">concept I think I read of yours</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.160" end="00:54:44.329" style="s2">something about a veto and it made me</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.869" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">think about an elite veto or something</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.329" end="00:54:49.190" style="s2">like that it made me think of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:52.190" style="s2">tyranny of the minority and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.190" end="00:54:55.640" style="s2">when the the minority is a tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.190" end="00:54:57.950" style="s2">their ideas are actually trying to shape</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.640" end="00:54:59.930" style="s2">us in ways that don&#39;t conform to who we</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.950" end="00:55:01.249" style="s2">are as human beings and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.930" end="00:55:03.700" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that works</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.249" end="00:55:05.650" style="s2">Baron Singh right now is there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.700" end="00:55:10.220" style="s2">takeover of our institutions</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.650" end="00:55:14.900" style="s2">universities media technology etc by a</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.170" end="00:55:25.010" style="s2">that happening because I feel it</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.810" end="00:55:27.380" style="s2">I think something like that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.010" end="00:55:29.780" style="s2">I so you know there&#39;s a great new book</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.380" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">out by Michael Lin called the new class</p>

<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:36.680" style="s2">feature of his book because you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:38.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s this sort of myth of</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.090" end="00:55:50.300" style="s2">the Indian caste system or you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.850" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">British class system we have genuine</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.300" end="00:55:54.800" style="s2">than we have inequality but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:57.710" style="s2">have class and Lin says though that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:55:57.710" end="00:56:03.350" style="s2">the post new to New Deal era was the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:06.140" style="s2">last great moment of sort of class</p>

<p begin="00:56:37.730" end="00:56:42.560" style="s2">four years those those institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.590" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">have crumbled because they were you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.560" end="00:56:47.480" style="s2">deemed to be the dragon on efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:49.370" style="s2">and in some sense like they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.480" end="00:56:53.960" style="s2">unions can be a drag on efficiency uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.370" end="00:56:56.210" style="s2">you know having you know you know Disney</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.960" end="00:56:57.320" style="s2">buy up Fox and you know everything else</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.210" end="00:57:00.470" style="s2">like maybe it&#39;s more efficient to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.320" end="00:57:04.040" style="s2">one company that owns all the media but</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.470" end="00:57:05.870" style="s2">but it ends up no well you know there</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.040" end="00:57:08.840" style="s2">are these things called returns to scale</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.870" end="00:57:11.510" style="s2">right like yeah and so there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.840" end="00:57:15.500" style="s2">a argument but it what it neglects is</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.510" end="00:57:17.600" style="s2">the role of power right and power</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.500" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t occur to it doesn&#39;t appear</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:29.300" style="s2">but power does exist and and you know</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.300" end="00:57:34.550" style="s2">of New Deal era sort of institutions</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.890" end="00:57:36.470" style="s2">eroded well all that was left was sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.550" end="00:57:37.420" style="s2">of the existing power structure that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.470" end="00:57:40.020" style="s2">made up of</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.420" end="00:57:42.849" style="s2">of you know people with higher education</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.020" end="00:57:45.940" style="s2">the managerial class the professional</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.849" end="00:57:47.410" style="s2">class and and they&#39;ve kind of taken over</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.940" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">the means of production and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.410" end="00:57:54.150" style="s2">that you know you know I myself and a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:57.099" style="s2">totally socially liberal you know I I</p>

<p begin="00:57:57.099" end="00:58:03.460" style="s2">no I am NOT day a trad by any means but</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.390" end="00:58:05.380" style="s2">you can you can if you take a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.460" end="00:58:07.240" style="s2">pluralistic perspective I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.380" end="00:58:09.809" style="s2">why liberal genuine liberalism is hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.240" end="00:58:14.230" style="s2">because real liberalism is pluralism and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.809" end="00:58:16.809" style="s2">not a kind of you know american-style</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.230" end="00:58:18.339" style="s2">liberalism which is like you know all</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.809" end="00:58:20.589" style="s2">you Christians are backward be bold and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.339" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">stuff like that like like the real real</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.589" end="00:58:24.790" style="s2">pluralism requires you to sort of step</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:26.859" style="s2">outside your ego and your own interests</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.790" end="00:58:28.690" style="s2">and to recognize the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.859" end="00:58:31.000" style="s2">different people believe different</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.690" end="00:58:33.309" style="s2">things and well I might not believe in a</p>

<p begin="00:58:33.309" end="00:58:39.849" style="s2">informs our views on sexuality and other</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.410" end="00:58:44.230" style="s2">things and you I can&#39;t it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.849" end="00:58:45.010" style="s2">consistent with pluralism to say no</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.230" end="00:58:47.020" style="s2">haven&#39;t you read The God Delusion</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.010" end="00:58:49.150" style="s2">there&#39;s no God you have to you you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.020" end="00:58:51.430" style="s2">right right but there are some things in</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.150" end="00:58:53.950" style="s2">which you cannot compromise right like</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.430" end="00:58:55.630" style="s2">what&#39;s what is I have some ideas what</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.950" end="00:58:58.809" style="s2">what would be something that you would</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.630" end="00:59:01.089" style="s2">not compromise on like for me it would</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.809" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">be the general framework of what what</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.089" end="00:59:05.140" style="s2">does equality equality to me means</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:06.819" style="s2">equality of opportunity to other people</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.140" end="00:59:10.180" style="s2">that might mean equality of outcomes and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.819" end="00:59:12.040" style="s2">now those to me are completely at odds</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.180" end="00:59:13.960" style="s2">with each other I think it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.040" end="00:59:19.180" style="s2">false dichotomy right like that like I</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.960" end="00:59:20.650" style="s2">think the the well not just a false</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.180" end="00:59:23.109" style="s2">economy but equality the outcome is kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.650" end="00:59:25.119" style="s2">of a bit of a straw man just to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.109" end="00:59:25.299" style="s2">frankly I think that tell me lay it on</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.119" end="00:59:26.890" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.299" end="00:59:29.710" style="s2">like the kind of egalitarianism that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.890" end="00:59:32.260" style="s2">that the pre rose ability and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.710" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">the New Deal style version of</p>

<p begin="00:59:37.569" end="00:59:42.369" style="s2">really about this social power right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.220" end="00:59:46.150" style="s2">is and that and that and that&#39;s what you</p>

<p begin="01:00:06.519" end="01:00:11.709" style="s2">and it gets channeled into sort of</p>

<p begin="01:02:25.959" end="01:02:29.799" style="s2">that they may be integrated in Canada is</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.629" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">that something that we should integrate</p>

<p begin="01:02:45.219" end="01:02:48.759" style="s2">masculine energy etc I think affirmative</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.379" end="01:02:50.049" style="s2">action is different from the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.999" end="01:03:08.489" style="s2">intersectional if I can point a turn</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.339" end="01:03:11.229" style="s2">it&#39;s my ears are burning it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.489" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">intersection of race and class right so</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.229" end="01:03:17.049" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a big difference if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:19.269" style="s2">have a wave of immigration a bunch of</p>

<p begin="01:03:41.229" end="01:03:46.389" style="s2">up identifying their cause as a white</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.839" end="01:03:49.389" style="s2">identity cause rather than as a class</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.389" end="01:03:51.699" style="s2">cause that might have some overlap with</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.389" end="01:03:53.439" style="s2">what what black and Hispanic working</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.699" end="01:03:54.579" style="s2">class people are facing right well I</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.439" end="01:03:56.409" style="s2">mean I think that that&#39;s the broad</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.579" end="01:03:57.939" style="s2">coalition that wins moving forward is</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.409" end="01:04:01.269" style="s2">the one that I totally agree understands</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.939" end="01:04:03.189" style="s2">that however you know I can&#39;t blame the</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.269" end="01:04:04.989" style="s2">white working-class and I hate that term</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.189" end="01:04:06.759" style="s2">actually because in my research</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.989" end="01:04:09.249" style="s2">especially the people that once voted</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.759" end="01:04:11.949" style="s2">Democrat who voted and for Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.249" end="01:04:12.790" style="s2">were not uneducated right they had a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.949" end="01:04:14.560" style="s2">of them had</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.790" end="01:04:16.090" style="s2">college education post-grad education</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.560" end="01:04:17.710" style="s2">and even the ones that didn&#39;t were</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.090" end="01:04:19.330" style="s2">entrepreneurs and businessmen and moved</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.710" end="01:04:21.430" style="s2">you know products around the world and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.330" end="01:04:24.700" style="s2">so these are these are people that have</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.430" end="01:04:28.030" style="s2">no education in the system but identity</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.700" end="01:04:30.490" style="s2">politics came for them right it came to</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.030" end="01:04:33.040" style="s2">them they keep hearing about it I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.490" end="01:04:35.740" style="s2">in a way especially the Democrats at a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.040" end="01:04:37.300" style="s2">portable type where I was raised to not</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.740" end="01:04:38.680" style="s2">think about race or think about gender</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.300" end="01:04:40.270" style="s2">and I was like okay that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.680" end="01:04:42.010" style="s2">you know George you slowly on however</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.270" end="01:04:43.830" style="s2">you behave and how you engage with me</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.010" end="01:04:47.530" style="s2">and what you can produce for the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.830" end="01:04:49.960" style="s2">but now we hear everywhere it seems is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.530" end="01:04:52.600" style="s2">is about our race and about our you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.960" end="01:04:54.820" style="s2">culture and about our 16:19 moment and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.600" end="01:04:56.110" style="s2">how our whole institutions and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.820" end="01:05:00.010" style="s2">everything is designed around race and</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.110" end="01:05:01.720" style="s2">oppression so you can&#39;t really fault the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.010" end="01:05:03.790" style="s2">white working-class folks that get</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.720" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">steamrolled through the china right no</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.790" end="01:05:07.840" style="s2">and then end up end up hearing about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:09.430" style="s2">in terms of race and then saying okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.840" end="01:05:10.630" style="s2">well I&#39;m white he&#39;s white we&#39;re white I</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.430" end="01:05:13.390" style="s2">mean we&#39;re all having the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.630" end="01:05:15.430" style="s2">so maybe house it just goes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.390" end="01:05:16.900" style="s2">kind of Alex Jones taking him seriously</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.430" end="01:05:18.670" style="s2">but not literally sort of thing like</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.900" end="01:05:25.630" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re grasping at some truth</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.670" end="01:05:29.200" style="s2">but the like it&#39;s very easy to just dump</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.630" end="01:05:31.960" style="s2">on on people who you might be expressing</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.200" end="01:05:35.740" style="s2">their views in ways that is you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.960" end="01:05:37.870" style="s2">frankly racist or xenophobic not</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.740" end="01:05:40.420" style="s2">recognizing that you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.870" end="01:05:42.460" style="s2">acknowledge that and still acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.420" end="01:05:45.060" style="s2">that they they have some valid and</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.460" end="01:05:47.500" style="s2">legitimate grievances and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.060" end="01:05:49.990" style="s2">addressing those grievances would</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.500" end="01:05:55.270" style="s2">preempt them from channeling that rage</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.990" end="01:05:58.300" style="s2">into these these red herrings right so</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.270" end="01:06:01.450" style="s2">you know I think there&#39;s a lot to this</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.300" end="01:06:04.210" style="s2">to it to what we call identity politics</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.450" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">it actually isn&#39;t about identity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.210" end="01:06:10.900" style="s2">about it&#39;s about labels right it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:14.170" style="s2">so another way to think with this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.900" end="01:06:18.480" style="s2">what what the floss Canadian philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.170" end="01:06:20.590" style="s2">Charles Taylor wrote about in his famous</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.480" end="01:06:21.670" style="s2">he&#39;s written about multiculturalism and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.590" end="01:06:24.010" style="s2">stuff like that but is he a famous essay</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.670" end="01:06:26.200" style="s2">called the ethics of authenticity and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.010" end="01:06:26.700" style="s2">his his analysis is that we&#39;ve moved</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.200" end="01:06:29.790" style="s2">through these</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.700" end="01:06:31.079" style="s2">phases of of what of how we how we think</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.790" end="01:06:32.940" style="s2">about about the individual how we</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.079" end="01:06:36.780" style="s2">conceptualize the individual the self</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.940" end="01:06:40.349" style="s2">and in an earlier phase we had honor</p>

<p begin="01:06:40.349" end="01:06:44.310" style="s2">know you know sticking up for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.839" end="01:06:47.160" style="s2">right and you know if you just take</p>

<p begin="01:06:48.690" end="01:06:54.210" style="s2">we moved into the kind of classical</p>

<p begin="01:06:54.210" end="01:06:59.550" style="s2">about the individual in relation to the</p>

<p begin="01:07:39.540" end="01:07:44.630" style="s2">more communitarian aspects of our</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.640" end="01:07:47.910" style="s2">identity right it&#39;s not just that I am</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.630" end="01:07:49.950" style="s2">you know Canadian is I I belong to a</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.910" end="01:07:52.829" style="s2">thing called Canada right like and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.950" end="01:07:55.710" style="s2">that belonging to a larger group is</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.829" end="01:07:58.079" style="s2">these more corporate identities is I</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.710" end="01:08:00.930" style="s2">think what&#39;s really missing today where</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.079" end="01:08:04.619" style="s2">we we think about everything in such an</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.930" end="01:08:07.890" style="s2">individualistic way that we miss the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.619" end="01:08:11.910" style="s2">ways in which our our identities are</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.890" end="01:08:15.690" style="s2">formed and collectives and not simply</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.910" end="01:08:18.900" style="s2">because I am part of the alphabet soup</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.690" end="01:08:22.710" style="s2">or you know or this or that or that or</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.900" end="01:08:25.259" style="s2">that ethnicity and even something like</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.710" end="01:08:26.759" style="s2">intersect intersectionality is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.259" end="01:08:30.509" style="s2">like the step beyond once you once you</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.759" end="01:08:32.580" style="s2">are you know defining individuality as</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.509" end="01:08:34.290" style="s2">your own authentic self-expression</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.580" end="01:08:38.609" style="s2">the next obvious next step is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.290" end="01:08:40.470" style="s2">subdivide that the identity such that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.609" end="01:08:41.880" style="s2">like you know you would</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.470" end="01:08:45.420" style="s2">would think that the individual was like</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.880" end="01:08:47.610" style="s2">the the bottom you know you get the from</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.420" end="01:08:51.120" style="s2">many to one but actually can subdivide</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.610" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">that one into even more and I think this</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.120" end="01:08:57.180" style="s2">is this is all in a weird way</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:58.980" style="s2">you know hyper individualistic and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.180" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">and this I think also goes to my point</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.980" end="01:09:02.970" style="s2">about like have a lot of this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:04.950" style="s2">derivative from Protestantism because</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.970" end="01:09:06.060" style="s2">you know one of the you know the whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.950" end="01:09:08.220" style="s2">point of the process</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.060" end="01:09:10.890" style="s2">Reformation is to say you know I am in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.220" end="01:09:12.240" style="s2">position to interpret God&#39;s Word and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.890" end="01:09:15.240" style="s2">don&#39;t need you to interpret it for me</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.240" end="01:09:18.600" style="s2">right and because I have you know a</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.240" end="01:09:22.290" style="s2">level of authenticity and able to and an</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.600" end="01:09:25.950" style="s2">able to form my identity individually</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.290" end="01:09:27.870" style="s2">right and and these modern</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.950" end="01:09:29.210" style="s2">manifestations of it are are just sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.870" end="01:09:31.170" style="s2">of a next stage and evolution</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.210" end="01:09:33.000" style="s2">Jonathan hated somebody that I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.170" end="01:09:34.380" style="s2">that you respect you so you cite him in</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.000" end="01:09:36.150" style="s2">rippner and talk about his books quite a</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.380" end="01:09:37.530" style="s2">bit and I think he&#39;s argued that we went</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.150" end="01:09:39.960" style="s2">from an honor culture to a victim</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.530" end="01:09:41.160" style="s2">culture is that how does that jive with</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.960" end="01:09:42.600" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about a victim</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.160" end="01:09:44.790" style="s2">culture which is you know I know knows</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.600" end="01:09:47.570" style="s2">all my conflicts I appeal to Authority</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.790" end="01:09:49.680" style="s2">etc no I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.570" end="01:09:54.330" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t put that in that way because I</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.680" end="01:09:56.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s a loaded term but because</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.330" end="01:09:58.410" style="s2">again I&#39;m not trying to make a political</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.910" end="01:09:59.910" style="s2">point like I don&#39;t you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.410" end="01:10:02.010" style="s2">really don&#39;t write a culture really at</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.910" end="01:10:03.750" style="s2">all I do use my own right I&#39;m personal</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.010" end="01:10:06.750" style="s2">or just having a conversation yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.750" end="01:10:09.830" style="s2">but you know I think the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.750" end="01:10:13.680" style="s2">quote-unquote victim culture is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.830" end="01:10:16.490" style="s2">symptom of the the deeper ethics of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.680" end="01:10:20.610" style="s2">authenticity that I&#39;m describing where</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.490" end="01:10:23.460" style="s2">we&#39;re you know in in the in the prior</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.610" end="01:10:25.170" style="s2">age like the classical liberal your your</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.460" end="01:10:26.490" style="s2">individual insofar as you have equality</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.170" end="01:10:30.540" style="s2">under the law and you have these</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.490" end="01:10:32.790" style="s2">liberties that that left that that that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.540" end="01:10:35.970" style="s2">defined human dignity and respect for</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.790" end="01:10:38.280" style="s2">human dignity as a kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.970" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">a kind of institutional relationship</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.280" end="01:10:43.320" style="s2">with the state and with with your own</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:45.450" style="s2">personal liberty the the new the in an</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.320" end="01:10:48.510" style="s2">age of authenticity human dignity</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.450" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">becomes defined as recognition do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.510" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">recognize that I&#39;m a special butterfly</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.400" end="01:10:53.790" style="s2">and if you are lacking that recognition</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:54.449" style="s2">even if you know you have basic</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.790" end="01:10:58.709" style="s2">liberties</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.449" end="01:11:01.800" style="s2">so on then in some ways you are being</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.709" end="01:11:05.400" style="s2">maltreated right and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.800" end="01:11:09.749" style="s2">what what identity politics the bad form</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.400" end="01:11:12.690" style="s2">of identity politics is is a kind of you</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.749" end="01:11:14.219" style="s2">must recognize me dammit right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.690" end="01:11:17.989" style="s2">it&#39;s not just tolerance it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.219" end="01:11:20.219" style="s2">acceptance and and even in celebration</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.989" end="01:11:22.789" style="s2">which you know in many cases might be</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.219" end="01:11:30.900" style="s2">may be really good and positive lit but</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.789" end="01:11:33.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it leads to a political</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.900" end="01:11:34.920" style="s2">impasse right because you can&#39;t force</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.420" end="01:11:38.610" style="s2">anyone to recognize things that they</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.920" end="01:11:41.039" style="s2">don&#39;t want to recognize right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.610" end="01:11:42.300" style="s2">lot of political impasses and even like</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.039" end="01:11:46.260" style="s2">the the so-called white working-class</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.300" end="01:11:48.389" style="s2">like a lot of that you know is a crying</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.260" end="01:11:50.429" style="s2">out for recognition like the if you feel</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.389" end="01:11:53.190" style="s2">like political system has a hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.429" end="01:11:55.739" style="s2">acknowledged your existence you&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.190" end="01:11:58.969" style="s2">that sort of mutual recognition that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.739" end="01:12:01.139" style="s2">fundamental to you know what</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.969" end="01:12:04.050" style="s2">civilization politics is right like this</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.139" end="01:12:07.769" style="s2">is a deeply like a galleon point right</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.050" end="01:12:10.229" style="s2">like the master-slave dialectic is one</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.769" end="01:12:12.179" style="s2">in which the the master comes to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.229" end="01:12:14.010" style="s2">recognize himself in the slave and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.179" end="01:12:16.619" style="s2">slave recognizes himself in the master</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.010" end="01:12:18.209" style="s2">and that&#39;s what what polls but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.619" end="01:12:20.579" style="s2">what leads to the abolition of slavery</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.209" end="01:12:24.900" style="s2">is this recognition of mutual sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.579" end="01:12:25.979" style="s2">level of social equality but if if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.900" end="01:12:28.769" style="s2">not talking about master and slave</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.979" end="01:12:31.289" style="s2">instead something totally unique</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.769" end="01:12:36.030" style="s2">intersectional idiosyncratic between the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.289" end="01:12:38.489" style="s2">two people or the two groups then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.030" end="01:12:40.380" style="s2">not clear how you produce a synthesis or</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.489" end="01:12:42.269" style="s2">how those two things merge what is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.380" end="01:12:43.019" style="s2">synthesis between the elites in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.269" end="01:12:46.170" style="s2">working class</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.019" end="01:12:47.610" style="s2">what synthesis happens there what but in</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.170" end="01:12:49.380" style="s2">this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.610" end="01:12:51.539" style="s2">issue of synthesis the issue is</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.380" end="01:12:54.329" style="s2">settlements right to have some set a</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.539" end="01:12:55.829" style="s2">settlement yeah like like political</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.329" end="01:13:00.530" style="s2">settlement like there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.829" end="01:13:03.229" style="s2">institutions in which disenfranchised</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.530" end="01:13:05.699" style="s2">working-class people of all backgrounds</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.229" end="01:13:07.139" style="s2">they can have a seat at the table</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.699" end="01:13:11.310" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.139" end="01:13:13.260" style="s2">now one of the other big big issues the</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.310" end="01:13:16.730" style="s2">striving this is just the the decline of</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.260" end="01:13:20.580" style="s2">religion right like you know there the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.730" end="01:13:22.320" style="s2">the Trump&#39;s base you know they might be</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.580" end="01:13:24.449" style="s2">identified as Christian but they have</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.320" end="01:13:27.750" style="s2">some of the lowest participation rates</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.449" end="01:13:29.820" style="s2">of in history for for American</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.750" end="01:13:31.650" style="s2">Christians is that specific to drum</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.820" end="01:13:34.199" style="s2">space or just specific to Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.650" end="01:13:39.449" style="s2">in general at the moment in general yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.199" end="01:13:40.920" style="s2">but you know the there is this this kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.449" end="01:13:42.480" style="s2">of secularization on two levels on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.920" end="01:13:44.850" style="s2">level of what people believe and what</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.480" end="01:13:48.449" style="s2">they say on surveys and on the level of</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.850" end="01:13:50.730" style="s2">just the crumbling of community and</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.449" end="01:13:55.170" style="s2">participation and and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.730" end="01:13:57.389" style="s2">culture is empty or void without some</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.170" end="01:13:59.750" style="s2">like objective instantiation in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.389" end="01:14:03.540" style="s2">world without you know a religion that</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.750" end="01:14:08.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a congregation isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.540" end="01:14:09.150" style="s2">a religion it just becomes a a it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.460" end="01:14:11.699" style="s2">become Hollow</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.150" end="01:14:13.590" style="s2">right and the culture a Christian</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.699" end="01:14:18.230" style="s2">culture is isn&#39;t really a culture unless</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.590" end="01:14:21.929" style="s2">it&#39;s embodied in some physical form and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.230" end="01:14:24.389" style="s2">so like the paradox the not the paradox</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.929" end="01:14:26.760" style="s2">but the one of the one of the impasses</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.389" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">is this fact that you know you do have</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.760" end="01:14:31.830" style="s2">people who have religious beliefs but</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:34.320" style="s2">they have no way of channeling that into</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.830" end="01:14:37.860" style="s2">or mobilizing that into into any kind of</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.980" end="01:16:11.660" style="s2">means I have all these thick thicker</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.470" end="01:16:15.590" style="s2">identities so like where I grew up in</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.660" end="01:16:18.440" style="s2">Nova Scotia you know its majority by far</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.590" end="01:16:20.030" style="s2">a white population but it&#39;s we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.440" end="01:16:22.160" style="s2">like you can tell the people&#39;s last name</p>

<p begin="01:16:22.160" end="01:16:26.150" style="s2">or French there&#39;s even schools that</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.410" end="01:16:29.030" style="s2">teach Gaelic right so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.150" end="01:16:31.130" style="s2">still robust sort of segmented</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.030" end="01:16:33.710" style="s2">communities there in a way that they</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.130" end="01:16:38.380" style="s2">haven&#39;t like totally assimilated into a</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.710" end="01:16:40.820" style="s2">Borg so I you know I think that</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.380" end="01:16:43.580" style="s2">institutions matter in this in this</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.820" end="01:16:45.590" style="s2">context because they&#39;re what are provide</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.580" end="01:16:47.390" style="s2">like the binding the glue the adhesive</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.590" end="01:16:49.370" style="s2">that keep these identities together and</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.390" end="01:16:52.970" style="s2">when you have when you have multiple</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.370" end="01:16:55.280" style="s2">identities and identities that are</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.970" end="01:16:58.520" style="s2">defined in terms of a group not just</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.280" end="01:17:02.090" style="s2">your own authenticity then they also are</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.520" end="01:17:07.190" style="s2">useful for cognitively right that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.090" end="01:17:09.830" style="s2">they make it easier to go left when</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.190" end="01:17:12.770" style="s2">everyone else is going right to give you</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.830" end="01:17:16.310" style="s2">an example so you know with the by far</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.770" end="01:17:17.930" style="s2">the most free thinking you know Trump</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.310" end="01:17:20.510" style="s2">ambivalent part of the Republican</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.930" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">coalition right now or are you ton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.510" end="01:17:25.070" style="s2">right and it&#39;s partly because you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:26.270" style="s2">they are not just Republican they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.070" end="01:17:29.360" style="s2">just conservative they&#39;re also Mormon</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.270" end="01:17:31.670" style="s2">and they have that splintered identity</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.360" end="01:17:34.489" style="s2">and and that the institutions around</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.670" end="01:17:37.250" style="s2">that the strength of the LDS Church it</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.489" end="01:17:39.830" style="s2">provides them you know it gives some</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.250" end="01:17:42.170" style="s2">traction to to actually be for your</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.830" end="01:17:46.130" style="s2">thinkers in some sense right right what</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.170" end="01:17:49.250" style="s2">do we do we not have examples where we</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.130" end="01:17:51.980" style="s2">have imported or we United States have</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.250" end="01:17:54.710" style="s2">exported political systems and tried to</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.980" end="01:17:58.640" style="s2">map them on to different cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.710" end="01:18:00.020" style="s2">how has that worked out and in studying</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.640" end="01:18:01.520" style="s2">that would we not be able then to</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.020" end="01:18:05.060" style="s2">understand what would happen if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.520" end="01:18:07.820" style="s2">imported a population into a political</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.060" end="01:18:08.449" style="s2">structure and how that would work out do</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.820" end="01:18:10.160" style="s2">you follow me</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.449" end="01:18:13.100" style="s2">yeah if they&#39;re a mirror image of each</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.160" end="01:18:15.410" style="s2">other yeah or what what pulls what</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.100" end="01:18:17.179" style="s2">creates which which creates which I mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.410" end="01:18:20.110" style="s2">has it worked for the United States to</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.179" end="01:18:23.390" style="s2">export its version of you know politics</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.110" end="01:18:26.210" style="s2">yeah so you know in in the tryna shock</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.390" end="01:18:28.670" style="s2">paper hey we made it back how you made</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.210" end="01:18:30.110" style="s2">it back well I think this is all you</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.670" end="01:18:32.780" style="s2">know this is all related right right</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.110" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">because really the China Shock Doctrine</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.780" end="01:18:36.710" style="s2">what it&#39;s saying is there&#39;s the gap</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.360" end="01:18:40.429" style="s2">between theory and practice</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.710" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">right and and in the last section I give</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.429" end="01:18:44.270" style="s2">I give the kind of dichotomy between</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.840" end="01:18:46.910" style="s2">this this debate and economics between</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.270" end="01:18:48.260" style="s2">the Austrian school and the historical</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.910" end="01:18:49.670" style="s2">school this is this is where the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.260" end="01:18:52.190" style="s2">emergence of the Austrian School of</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.670" end="01:18:56.060" style="s2">Economics came from where the where the</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.190" end="01:18:58.580" style="s2">historicists largely German they</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.060" end="01:19:00.739" style="s2">maintained that you know history and</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.580" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">context and path dependency are our</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.739" end="01:19:04.010" style="s2">starting points we start by looking at</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">reality and seeing how its embedded in</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.010" end="01:19:09.500" style="s2">history and then making institutional</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:15.050" style="s2">reforms that way whereas the Austrians</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.500" end="01:19:17.330" style="s2">with karl menger and and you know those</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.050" end="01:19:20.870" style="s2">guys like they they&#39;re they were a kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.330" end="01:19:23.000" style="s2">of positivism in the sense that they the</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.870" end="01:19:25.580" style="s2">school emerged because they rejected the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.000" end="01:19:28.250" style="s2">historical school and said no there are</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.580" end="01:19:30.350" style="s2">these universal laws to economics you</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.250" end="01:19:33.590" style="s2">know demand curves slope down supply</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.350" end="01:19:35.630" style="s2">curve slope up and humans act proposal</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.590" end="01:19:39.590" style="s2">ii and like these axiomatic laws of</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.630" end="01:19:40.489" style="s2">economics perfect information also well</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.590" end="01:19:43.010" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.489" end="01:19:45.510" style="s2">neoclassical version of it and and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.010" end="01:19:47.910" style="s2">there&#39;s truth to that like</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.510" end="01:19:49.530" style="s2">that&#39;s theory right that&#39;s theory is</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.910" end="01:19:51.380" style="s2">when you take something you see in</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.530" end="01:19:53.810" style="s2">reality like something in practice and</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.380" end="01:19:56.370" style="s2">abstract it right and make it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.810" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">decontextualized right and theory can be</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.370" end="01:20:02.790" style="s2">very useful because if something over</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:04.020" style="s2">here is related to something over here</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.790" end="01:20:05.460" style="s2">if you have a theory that explains the</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.020" end="01:20:09.060" style="s2">one maybe it also explains the other</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.460" end="01:20:13.800" style="s2">right but to the extent that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.060" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">Austrian that positivistic Theory first</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.800" end="01:20:19.520" style="s2">view became sort of the norm and</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.280" end="01:20:22.980" style="s2">neoclassical economics more generally</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.520" end="01:20:25.290" style="s2">then you end up in a situation where you</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.980" end="01:20:26.850" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s easy to just go into into</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.290" end="01:20:31.200" style="s2">Russia following the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.850" end="01:20:35.310" style="s2">Soviet Union and impose a schema that in</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.200" end="01:20:37.080" style="s2">principle or in theory is like the</p>

<p begin="01:20:37.080" end="01:20:41.460" style="s2">instead what ended up happening is you</p>

<p begin="01:21:42.930" end="01:21:48.300" style="s2">opposed to these just purely theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.150" end="01:21:53.130" style="s2">free-market types that were that used to</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.300" end="01:21:55.620" style="s2">run the country and and the point of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.130" end="01:21:57.239" style="s2">this is that like shock therapy as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.620" end="01:21:59.010" style="s2">called like going into a place and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.239" end="01:22:01.409" style="s2">radically reforming it</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.010" end="01:22:03.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not an indictment of the model like</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.409" end="01:22:04.949" style="s2">the model might work somewhere else but</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.000" end="01:22:08.099" style="s2">you can&#39;t just take Hong Kong&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.949" end="01:22:10.050" style="s2">and put it on to Indonesia because Hong</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.099" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">Kong because Indonesia has a totally</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.050" end="01:22:15.110" style="s2">different path dependent history and and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:17.639" style="s2">where this is maybe different from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.110" end="01:22:19.949" style="s2">immigration argument about like oh if we</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.639" end="01:22:22.199" style="s2">import people we import their culture is</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.949" end="01:22:25.590" style="s2">it&#39;s less about culture than is about</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.199" end="01:22:28.019" style="s2">institutions right so you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.590" end="01:22:29.579" style="s2">a if you&#39;re in India or Indonesia</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.019" end="01:22:32.099" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a large informal</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.579" end="01:22:34.050" style="s2">economy maybe it has you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.099" end="01:22:36.300" style="s2">have normal legal system but maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.050" end="01:22:38.219" style="s2">has you know pseudo legal systems to</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.300" end="01:22:41.039" style="s2">have different institutions that</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.219" end="01:22:42.750" style="s2">regulate commerce and you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.039" end="01:22:44.639" style="s2">come and blow that up but if someone</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.750" end="01:22:47.400" style="s2">from Indonesia comes to the United</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.639" end="01:22:49.320" style="s2">States it you know it&#39;s not that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.400" end="01:22:50.369" style="s2">did that they&#39;re bringing their culture</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.320" end="01:22:53.659" style="s2">of course but they&#39;re also but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.369" end="01:22:56.420" style="s2">not bringing the the institutional</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.659" end="01:22:58.980" style="s2">scaffolding that that culture lives on</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.420" end="01:23:00.929" style="s2">and so I think the the worry is that if</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.980" end="01:23:02.309" style="s2">we import a bunch of Indians we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.929" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">to get Indian institutions or</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.309" end="01:23:06.179" style="s2">what-have-you or Mexicans are going get</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:09.570" style="s2">Mexican stitute is way way overblown and</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.179" end="01:23:13.920" style="s2">also just doesn&#39;t you know empirically</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.570" end="01:23:15.929" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold up it&#39;s interesting hey</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.920" end="01:23:17.789" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard the institution argument</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.929" end="01:23:19.349" style="s2">consistently beat over my head a million</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.789" end="01:23:20.610" style="s2">billion times was at Georgetown School</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.349" end="01:23:22.500" style="s2">Foreign Service and we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.610" end="01:23:24.780" style="s2">these same sort of shock therapy</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.500" end="01:23:26.760" style="s2">treatments that were given to various</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.780" end="01:23:29.280" style="s2">states in emerging markets Latin America</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.760" end="01:23:30.750" style="s2">as well and you know the key to their</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.280" end="01:23:31.769" style="s2">success was always all gotta have</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.750" end="01:23:32.969" style="s2">institutions got to have an</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.769" end="01:23:34.320" style="s2">institution&#39;s gotta have institutions</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.969" end="01:23:35.280" style="s2">but the institutions come from somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.320" end="01:23:37.079" style="s2">and they come from the people and they</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.280" end="01:23:38.639" style="s2">come from the history that&#39;s why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.079" end="01:23:41.300" style="s2">called institution yeah they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.639" end="01:23:44.639" style="s2">institutions and you can&#39;t create them</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.300" end="01:23:48.960" style="s2">you can if you are Pinochet</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.639" end="01:23:52.469" style="s2">right like and this is why the model</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.960" end="01:23:54.719" style="s2">like it kind of presumes a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.469" end="01:23:57.630" style="s2">dictator right right it requires it</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.719" end="01:24:00.239" style="s2">almost right and so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.630" end="01:24:01.829" style="s2">reason why it&#39;s problematic but that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.239" end="01:24:04.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that reforms not possible</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.829" end="01:24:08.489" style="s2">it just has to be endogenous it has to</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.380" end="01:24:12.510" style="s2">come some level from within like we you</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.489" end="01:24:14.580" style="s2">know you can have outside support but if</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.510" end="01:24:16.320" style="s2">you impose the theory without without</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.580" end="01:24:18.810" style="s2">trying to shape the practice at the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.320" end="01:24:21.300" style="s2">time then you get this disjoint right in</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.810" end="01:24:22.290" style="s2">that disjoint means that the theory</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.300" end="01:24:24.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually work the way you think</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.290" end="01:24:26.160" style="s2">it does right I I do like the way that</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.870" end="01:24:27.240" style="s2">at the end of the piece you did talk</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.160" end="01:24:28.890" style="s2">about the difference between the</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.240" end="01:24:30.060" style="s2">Austrians and the historicist sand and</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.890" end="01:24:33.270" style="s2">you said am I saying that right</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.060" end="01:24:35.250" style="s2">historicist and it was really the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.270" end="01:24:36.720" style="s2">difference between whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.250" end="01:24:39.990" style="s2">something&#39;s gonna work in my little text</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.720" end="01:24:42.000" style="s2">book or a we can look towards history</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.990" end="01:24:44.370" style="s2">see we&#39;ll see what worked and then try</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.000" end="01:24:46.890" style="s2">to work with that to improve it and to</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.370" end="01:24:48.540" style="s2">move things along I think you should had</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.890" end="01:24:50.430" style="s2">a graph in there or I see I saw</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.540" end="01:24:52.860" style="s2">somewhere where it&#39;s yeah sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.430" end="01:24:54.780" style="s2">the squiggly upward sloping line that</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.860" end="01:24:56.820" style="s2">bounces up against the guardrails of</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.780" end="01:24:58.710" style="s2">institutions in history and would you</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.820" end="01:25:02.070" style="s2">call it path dependent yes a dependency</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.710" end="01:25:04.590" style="s2">yeah history matters and it matters not</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.070" end="01:25:06.540" style="s2">just it matters and it to our norms as</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.590" end="01:25:08.370" style="s2">well like our norms our products of</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.540" end="01:25:10.650" style="s2">history they evolve like morality</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.370" end="01:25:11.970" style="s2">evolves it doesn&#39;t necessarily bend</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.650" end="01:25:15.510" style="s2">towards justice or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.970" end="01:25:17.670" style="s2">like that&#39;s that that&#39;s a backwards</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.510" end="01:25:21.060" style="s2">reconstruction of what&#39;s happened but um</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.670" end="01:25:23.520" style="s2">you know but like to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.060" end="01:25:26.510" style="s2">know America had much different cultural</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.520" end="01:25:30.750" style="s2">attitudes in the 50s and 60s you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.510" end="01:25:33.360" style="s2">just to to them in the present we look</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.750" end="01:25:35.430" style="s2">across the sea and see countries where</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.360" end="01:25:37.950" style="s2">you know they&#39;re their culture attitudes</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.430" end="01:25:40.590" style="s2">are even more retrograde than the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.950" end="01:25:42.540" style="s2">fifties and sixties right then we demand</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.590" end="01:25:46.160" style="s2">them to you know why you know why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.540" end="01:25:47.430" style="s2">uh you know gay marriage legal in in</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.160" end="01:25:53.100" style="s2">China</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.430" end="01:25:55.950" style="s2">well like you America you only legal gay</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.100" end="01:25:58.050" style="s2">marriage you know like after oberfeld</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.950" end="01:26:00.210" style="s2">like it just happened like right come on</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.050" end="01:26:02.160" style="s2">like you can&#39;t force this normative</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.210" end="01:26:05.460" style="s2">change because normative nor normative</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.160" end="01:26:06.990" style="s2">change like more moral change is</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.460" end="01:26:08.160" style="s2">something that lives in look in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.990" end="01:26:11.280" style="s2">people and lives in the culture and</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.160" end="01:26:14.040" style="s2">lives not not as an individual not as an</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.280" end="01:26:17.190" style="s2">individual but in in the group and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.040" end="01:26:21.030" style="s2">peers and the way that the norms get</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.190" end="01:26:23.550" style="s2">embodied in actual rules right so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.030" end="01:26:25.770" style="s2">I know you just just dismiss this</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.550" end="01:26:26.280" style="s2">argument but it seems to me that in that</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.770" end="01:26:28.619" style="s2">model you</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.280" end="01:26:30.000" style="s2">just presented there that if the inputs</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.619" end="01:26:33.000" style="s2">changed and the outputs would change to</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.000" end="01:26:34.619" style="s2">right if your input of your people into</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.000" end="01:26:36.659" style="s2">your communities than your norms to</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.619" end="01:26:39.719" style="s2">change then ultimately our institutions</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.659" end="01:26:41.909" style="s2">change and look I am I am only exploring</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.719" end="01:26:45.599" style="s2">these issues I like I said I was raised</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.909" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">to believe totally open-minded you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.599" end="01:26:49.679" style="s2">I don&#39;t see race don&#39;t see gender</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:52.050" style="s2">whatever you perform if you fit into our</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.679" end="01:26:54.179" style="s2">American you know dream a vision then</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.050" end="01:26:56.039" style="s2">it&#39;s all good and let&#39;s all just work</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.179" end="01:26:57.480" style="s2">hard and stuff and it&#39;s only just in</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.039" end="01:26:58.800" style="s2">these last like five or ten years where</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.480" end="01:27:00.389" style="s2">you just get beat over the head with</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.800" end="01:27:01.739" style="s2">race and culture so many times you have</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.389" end="01:27:04.139" style="s2">to start taking a look at it from the</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.739" end="01:27:06.300" style="s2">other perspective and again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.139" end="01:27:07.469" style="s2">reluctantly having these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.300" end="01:27:08.550" style="s2">but they&#39;re right but they&#39;re out there</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.469" end="01:27:10.340" style="s2">and they&#39;re like being four they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.550" end="01:27:13.619" style="s2">being forced on us and so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.340" end="01:27:16.440" style="s2">explore but various happen in the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.619" end="01:27:19.679" style="s2">way that you know the Paul Krugman trade</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.440" end="01:27:22.050" style="s2">strategy of hiding the nuance backfired</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.679" end="01:27:23.960" style="s2">and gave a mean and ended up giving the</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.050" end="01:27:27.150" style="s2">ammunition to the barbarians like when</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.960" end="01:27:28.980" style="s2">when when certain topics are off when</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.150" end="01:27:31.710" style="s2">certain things are off topic or not</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.980" end="01:27:32.969" style="s2">you&#39;re not to talk about them then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.710" end="01:27:34.280" style="s2">only the barbarians who are going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.969" end="01:27:37.579" style="s2">talk about them right</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.280" end="01:27:42.030" style="s2">not just called me a barbarian well no</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.579" end="01:27:43.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a spectrum you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.030" end="01:27:46.920" style="s2">Steven Pinker made this point to it the</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.920" end="01:27:49.500" style="s2">all right which is like you know if if</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.920" end="01:27:53.849" style="s2">we can&#39;t talk about group differences in</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.500" end="01:27:55.860" style="s2">genetics or gender differences if</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.849" end="01:27:59.159" style="s2">there&#39;s some taboo some elite taboo</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.860" end="01:28:01.170" style="s2">around that topic then when people go</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.159" end="01:28:03.270" style="s2">you know go to college and hear this and</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.170" end="01:28:04.559" style="s2">then they&#39;re like that&#39;s insane and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.270" end="01:28:06.150" style="s2">they go back to their computer and they</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.559" end="01:28:09.900" style="s2">look up go on YouTube and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.150" end="01:28:13.289" style="s2">find the the most polar opposite</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.900" end="01:28:16.020" style="s2">interpretation of the facts and - you</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.289" end="01:28:19.079" style="s2">like - when discussion gets shut down or</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.020" end="01:28:22.829" style="s2">when things get off topic or closed</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.079" end="01:28:25.889" style="s2">right um whether it be about trade and</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.829" end="01:28:29.699" style="s2">globalization or about race identity</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.889" end="01:28:30.900" style="s2">gender etc then I think that actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.699" end="01:28:31.949" style="s2">ends up contributing to polarization</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.900" end="01:28:33.480" style="s2">right because you don&#39;t you have the</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.949" end="01:28:39.300" style="s2">official narrative and then you have the</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.480" end="01:28:40.110" style="s2">counter culture that that feels in some</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.300" end="01:28:45.239" style="s2">way that they&#39;re lied to</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.110" end="01:28:47.820" style="s2">and then end up adopting like the most</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.239" end="01:28:50.010" style="s2">radical mirror image of what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.820" end="01:28:53.100" style="s2">been told right you probably consider me</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.010" end="01:28:54.780" style="s2">me to be some sort of radical but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.100" end="01:28:55.350" style="s2">coming in I think of you as a moderate</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.780" end="01:28:56.880" style="s2">as a matter</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.350" end="01:29:00.270" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m coming I&#39;m coming at this from</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.880" end="01:29:02.550" style="s2">a I don&#39;t know if I hesitate to use</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.270" end="01:29:05.420" style="s2">words that have actual meaning beyond</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.550" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">casual use but like as a reaction to</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.420" end="01:29:11.340" style="s2">things like I&#39;m focused mostly on gender</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.600" end="01:29:14.460" style="s2">and gender identity and rolls right</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.340" end="01:29:17.159" style="s2">masculinity and femininity and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.460" end="01:29:18.869" style="s2">reason why is evidenced by things like</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.159" end="01:29:21.300" style="s2">the American Psychological Association</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.869" end="01:29:22.889" style="s2">coming out last year and basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.300" end="01:29:24.830" style="s2">saying that all characteristics that</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.889" end="01:29:27.030" style="s2">make up men are toxic and need to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.830" end="01:29:30.060" style="s2">pathologized and need to be you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.030" end="01:29:31.560" style="s2">treated out of the the population so</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.060" end="01:29:34.530" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s a very concrete</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.560" end="01:29:36.480" style="s2">example of our institutions that feed</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.530" end="01:29:39.060" style="s2">into our professional and health care</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.480" end="01:29:41.790" style="s2">system that are gonna have a very direct</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.060" end="01:29:43.860" style="s2">effect on on people that I think are is</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.790" end="01:29:47.040" style="s2">gonna be negative yeah I&#39;m not denying</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.860" end="01:29:52.949" style="s2">that what I&#39;m saying is that people like</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.040" end="01:29:56.250" style="s2">Jonathan Haight who you have who who</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.949" end="01:30:00.300" style="s2">make some of these same points you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.250" end="01:30:02.850" style="s2">they have more power more more social</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.300" end="01:30:06.239" style="s2">influence and a healthier kind of social</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.850" end="01:30:11.580" style="s2">influence then the men&#39;s rights activist</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.239" end="01:30:15.360" style="s2">who goes all the C&#39;s misandry and</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.580" end="01:30:18.570" style="s2">becomes misogynist rightly well to be an</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.360" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">anti misandry does not necessarily make</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.570" end="01:30:24.030" style="s2">you a misogynist let&#39;s make that person</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:25.560" style="s2">know exactly the whole point yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.030" end="01:30:27.480" style="s2">well you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.560" end="01:30:28.949" style="s2">issues and we&#39;re we&#39;ve been at this for</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.480" end="01:30:30.389" style="s2">about 90 minutes and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.949" end="01:30:32.100" style="s2">certain elements of the China shock</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.389" end="01:30:34.080" style="s2">thing I really want to get you know 90</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.100" end="01:30:36.270" style="s2">so we&#39;re all for it</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.080" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">so let&#39;s circle back to the China China</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.270" end="01:30:41.400" style="s2">thing so 1990s China gets a you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:43.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a big push from everybody in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.400" end="01:30:44.420" style="s2">United States in the world to get China</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.199" end="01:30:46.530" style="s2">into the World Trade Organization</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.420" end="01:30:48.570" style="s2">normalize trade relations with them</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.530" end="01:30:49.710" style="s2">which means we can send products back</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.570" end="01:30:50.970" style="s2">and forth and of course all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.710" end="01:30:52.560" style="s2">businessmen in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.970" end="01:30:55.350" style="s2">politicians in their pocket were just</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.560" end="01:30:57.750" style="s2">chomping at the bit to get into that big</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.350" end="01:31:00.390" style="s2">giant market and sell all their cars and</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.750" end="01:31:03.330" style="s2">everything over there in China and</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.390" end="01:31:05.460" style="s2">nobody told regular Americans what was</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.330" end="01:31:08.430" style="s2">going to happen and we ended up getting</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.460" end="01:31:10.800" style="s2">a carving out of the Rust Belt and other</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.430" end="01:31:12.570" style="s2">industrial areas that you can look at</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.800" end="01:31:14.370" style="s2">the map the last electoral map and you</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.570" end="01:31:16.080" style="s2">can basically see where it was right it</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.370" end="01:31:18.930" style="s2">was the degradation of Hillary&#39;s blue</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.080" end="01:31:22.350" style="s2">wall and you know Michigan Ohio</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.930" end="01:31:24.120" style="s2">Pennsylvania those are the three and you</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.350" end="01:31:25.950" style="s2">know States really helped to turn turn</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.120" end="01:31:31.080" style="s2">to the election for him on a very small</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.950" end="01:31:32.880" style="s2">thin margin now is the FBI 70 oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.080" end="01:31:35.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know we don&#39;t know each other just</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.880" end="01:31:36.540" style="s2">yet so you know 77,000 votes across</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.250" end="01:31:39.150" style="s2">those states really turned everything</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.540" end="01:31:40.980" style="s2">and all this was based on this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.150" end="01:31:42.900" style="s2">comparative advantage and I remember</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.980" end="01:31:44.580" style="s2">being taught as a kid in economics I</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.900" end="01:31:46.650" style="s2">have a Tyrian economics comparative</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.580" end="01:31:48.210" style="s2">advantage like the foundation for all of</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.650" end="01:31:50.040" style="s2">our trade policies and for all the</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.210" end="01:31:52.680" style="s2">reasons why we should trade maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.040" end="01:31:56.820" style="s2">could just explain what it is and then</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.680" end="01:31:58.350" style="s2">explain how maybe in whatever your take</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.820" end="01:31:59.730" style="s2">is I think I have an idea on how it</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.350" end="01:32:01.230" style="s2">actually translates into the writing</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.730" end="01:32:03.480" style="s2">world and the pros and the cons and and</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.230" end="01:32:04.890" style="s2">what had happened and maybe you can</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.480" end="01:32:06.360" style="s2">couch it in terms of race to the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.890" end="01:32:07.740" style="s2">and these sort of things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.360" end="01:32:10.590" style="s2">also thrown out there during the</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.740" end="01:32:12.510" style="s2">protests as well too yeah so I think the</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.590" end="01:32:15.780" style="s2">easiest way to explain comparative</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.510" end="01:32:18.360" style="s2">advantage is with a more micro example</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.780" end="01:32:21.060" style="s2">so you know the you learn about this in</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.360" end="01:32:22.470" style="s2">in trade books when they talk about you</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.060" end="01:32:26.430" style="s2">know wine and butter guns and butter or</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.470" end="01:32:28.850" style="s2">whatever but a better example or easier</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.430" end="01:32:31.290" style="s2">to grasp example might be you know a</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.850" end="01:32:38.610" style="s2">lawyer and his secretary or her</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.290" end="01:32:43.770" style="s2">secretary or their secretary check-check</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.610" end="01:32:47.220" style="s2">the bio to make sure so you know a</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.770" end="01:32:49.710" style="s2">lawyer might be it&#39;s obviously good at</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.220" end="01:32:52.260" style="s2">lawyering but might be even better maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.710" end="01:32:54.240" style="s2">might be better than any secretary like</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.260" end="01:32:55.440" style="s2">at being a secretary like they can</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.240" end="01:32:57.930" style="s2">answer the phone like no one&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.440" end="01:32:59.010" style="s2">but it still makes sense for them to</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.930" end="01:33:02.100" style="s2">hire a secretary</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.010" end="01:33:03.690" style="s2">because being specializing and become</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.100" end="01:33:04.650" style="s2">and being and just focusing on being a</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.690" end="01:33:07.380" style="s2">lawyer</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.650" end="01:33:10.770" style="s2">is their highest value activity right</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.380" end="01:33:12.990" style="s2">and so and they in the lingo they have</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.770" end="01:33:15.420" style="s2">an absolute advantage in both secretary</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.990" end="01:33:17.880" style="s2">and layering but they have a comparative</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.420" end="01:33:21.240" style="s2">advantage in being a lawyer and so and</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.880" end="01:33:23.550" style="s2">so comparative advantage describes the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.240" end="01:33:27.230" style="s2">theory of specialization and trade so in</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.550" end="01:33:29.520" style="s2">lawyer specializes and and then hires a</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.230" end="01:33:33.030" style="s2">secretary who specializes in being a</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.520" end="01:33:36.330" style="s2">secretary right and and and that ends up</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.030" end="01:33:39.120" style="s2">being you know ends up creating gains</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.330" end="01:33:41.700" style="s2">from trade that exceed what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.120" end="01:33:43.890" style="s2">possible if they both try to try to just</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.700" end="01:33:45.660" style="s2">do things all on their own um and this</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.890" end="01:33:48.210" style="s2">is like foundational theory this is like</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.660" end="01:33:50.370" style="s2">bedrock stuff that all trade theory is</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.210" end="01:33:51.810" style="s2">based on right yeah and it goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.370" end="01:33:53.370" style="s2">David Ricardo who&#39;s a classical</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.810" end="01:33:56.910" style="s2">economists it&#39;s been been around for 200</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.370" end="01:33:59.460" style="s2">years so it&#39;s an in its some level it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.910" end="01:34:01.650" style="s2">kind of just common sense right like I</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.460" end="01:34:03.780" style="s2">don&#39;t try to make but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.650" end="01:34:05.310" style="s2">make my own bread you know I I get the</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.780" end="01:34:06.900" style="s2">bread from the baker right because the</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.310" end="01:34:08.520" style="s2">baker specializes in making bread right</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.900" end="01:34:12.300" style="s2">right and it&#39;s level of international</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.520" end="01:34:14.760" style="s2">trade there&#39;s similar patterns like you</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.300" end="01:34:17.430" style="s2">know I get my t-shirts imported from</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.760" end="01:34:19.230" style="s2">Bangladesh because they have a</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.430" end="01:34:21.840" style="s2">labor-intensive economy they&#39;re lower</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.230" end="01:34:27.290" style="s2">wage and so if there&#39;s a labor-intensive</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.840" end="01:34:30.180" style="s2">process they can specialize in that and</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.290" end="01:34:35.220" style="s2">do it at lower cost and they could if me</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.180" end="01:34:39.030" style="s2">a economist tried to you know start a</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.220" end="01:34:40.410" style="s2">cotton mill or okay and so and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.030" end="01:34:42.450" style="s2">the level of international trade we</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.410" end="01:34:44.640" style="s2">often talk about sort of factor</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.450" end="01:34:47.210" style="s2">intensity factor abundance right so like</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.640" end="01:34:49.530" style="s2">America is abundant in high school labor</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.210" end="01:34:52.110" style="s2">Bangladesh is abundant in low skilled</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.530" end="01:34:54.300" style="s2">labor and so they should do things that</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.110" end="01:34:56.850" style="s2">don&#39;t require a lot of skills but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.300" end="01:34:58.560" style="s2">require a lot of just raw all aber input</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.850" end="01:35:00.300" style="s2">and we should do the things that are you</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.560" end="01:35:01.890" style="s2">know more capital intensive you know I</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.300" end="01:35:02.490" style="s2">press a button and the robot does the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.890" end="01:35:05.880" style="s2">job for me</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.490" end="01:35:08.340" style="s2">or or more knowledge intensive that</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.880" end="01:35:09.150" style="s2">require years of education and and</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.340" end="01:35:11.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic theory behind</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.150" end="01:35:11.820" style="s2">comparative advantage right that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.010" end="01:35:13.260" style="s2">all groovy</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.820" end="01:35:14.679" style="s2">sounds like perfect hey we should just</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.260" end="01:35:17.400" style="s2">you know follow that every</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.679" end="01:35:21.550" style="s2">and go exactly wherever it leads right</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.400" end="01:35:23.920" style="s2">well the way I&#39;ve put this before is the</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.550" end="01:35:28.979" style="s2">the main part that comparative advantage</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.920" end="01:35:31.989" style="s2">is false it&#39;s that it&#39;s static right so</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.979" end="01:35:34.209" style="s2">econ there are different out there are</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.989" end="01:35:35.800" style="s2">different conclusions and economic</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.209" end="01:35:38.110" style="s2">models if they&#39;re a static model or a</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.800" end="01:35:41.229" style="s2">dynamic model meaning that they have</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.110" end="01:35:43.989" style="s2">time as a variable and static as a</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.229" end="01:35:45.729" style="s2">static model of course I found you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.989" end="01:35:46.929" style="s2">I should hire secretary and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.729" end="01:35:48.939" style="s2">secretary should specialize it being a</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.929" end="01:35:50.559" style="s2">secretary but what if that secretary</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.939" end="01:35:53.650" style="s2">wants to become a lawyer herself one day</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.559" end="01:35:55.599" style="s2">right then you start off being a</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.650" end="01:35:57.849" style="s2">secretary but you go to night school and</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.599" end="01:35:59.860" style="s2">you train your you build new skills you</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.849" end="01:36:00.999" style="s2">build new competencies until you have a</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.860" end="01:36:02.979" style="s2">comparative advantage in being a lawyer</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.999" end="01:36:05.679" style="s2">right and so when you introduce the time</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.979" end="01:36:07.119" style="s2">dimension suddenly things change so in</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.679" end="01:36:09.969" style="s2">the case of you know America and</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.119" end="01:36:11.739" style="s2">Bangladesh you know when Bangladesh</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.969" end="01:36:15.329" style="s2">liberalized and that they they followed</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.739" end="01:36:18.010" style="s2">the kind of World Bank neoliberal advice</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.329" end="01:36:21.670" style="s2">they specialized in labor intensive</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.010" end="01:36:25.119" style="s2">low-skilled labor and at first it was a</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.670" end="01:36:27.789" style="s2">success I get their GDP took off they</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.119" end="01:36:28.719" style="s2">they&#39;ve if they&#39;ve had declines in</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.789" end="01:36:31.389" style="s2">poverty and so on</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.719" end="01:36:34.300" style="s2">but at the same time by specializing in</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.389" end="01:36:37.179" style="s2">things are labor intensive you know the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.300" end="01:36:38.289" style="s2">the binding factor there is wages and if</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.179" end="01:36:39.969" style="s2">you specialize in being a low-wage</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.289" end="01:36:43.059" style="s2">country it&#39;s hard to stop being a</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.969" end="01:36:44.860" style="s2">low-wage country right like and so to</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.059" end="01:36:48.039" style="s2">this day you know even though they take</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.860" end="01:36:50.489" style="s2">off growth you know Bangladesh and China</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.039" end="01:36:53.709" style="s2">begin liberalizing around the same time</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.489" end="01:36:55.989" style="s2">but today Bangladesh is GDP per capita</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.709" end="01:36:59.380" style="s2">is a third of that of China&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.989" end="01:37:01.179" style="s2">the reason is because when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.380" end="01:37:04.030" style="s2">economic development development whole</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.179" end="01:37:06.039" style="s2">countries you actually don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.030" end="01:37:07.630" style="s2">specializes you know specialization at</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.039" end="01:37:10.389" style="s2">all but you want is diversification</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.630" end="01:37:11.999" style="s2">right and diversification you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.389" end="01:37:14.289" style="s2">linguistically is the opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.999" end="01:37:16.420" style="s2">specialization right so what does</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.289" end="01:37:18.459" style="s2">comparative advantage in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.420" end="01:37:21.189" style="s2">China the World Trade Organization and</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.459" end="01:37:23.590" style="s2">free trade free capital free people what</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.189" end="01:37:25.540" style="s2">does that do what a specialization due</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.590" end="01:37:29.620" style="s2">to the United States</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.540" end="01:37:31.810" style="s2">so the flipside of low-wage countries</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.620" end="01:37:34.090" style="s2">specializing and labor-intensive goods</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.810" end="01:37:35.920" style="s2">is that we have have increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.090" end="01:37:37.990" style="s2">specialized in knowledge intensive goods</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.920" end="01:37:42.430" style="s2">so we call this knowledge workers at the</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.990" end="01:37:44.830" style="s2">creative class and and and that that</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.430" end="01:37:47.140" style="s2">trend has coincided with you know the</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.830" end="01:37:51.310" style="s2">rising premium for a college education</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.140" end="01:37:55.540" style="s2">the clustering of college-educated</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.310" end="01:37:57.280" style="s2">people into a handful of superstar</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.540" end="01:37:59.710" style="s2">cities cities that are integrated</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.280" end="01:38:06.250" style="s2">globally the you know escalating rents</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.710" end="01:38:10.930" style="s2">in those cities and the the relative</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.250" end="01:38:15.040" style="s2">neglect of people with lower down the</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.930" end="01:38:16.270" style="s2">human capital scale right so the way I</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.040" end="01:38:18.640" style="s2">put it in the piece is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.270" end="01:38:20.830" style="s2">human capital you know we think of it in</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.640" end="01:38:22.450" style="s2">and you can eat in economics we took we</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.830" end="01:38:24.340" style="s2">measure human capital just by like years</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.450" end="01:38:29.290" style="s2">of education right but that&#39;s a proxy</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.340" end="01:38:32.440" style="s2">like years of education it makes it seem</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.290" end="01:38:34.900" style="s2">like human capital is a linear spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.440" end="01:38:37.690" style="s2">from low skill to high skill in fact</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.900" end="01:38:40.030" style="s2">human capital is as diverse as physical</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.690" end="01:38:41.380" style="s2">capital right like a factory is a</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.030" end="01:38:45.480" style="s2">different kind of capital than a</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.380" end="01:38:48.040" style="s2">computer and we can&#39;t just call both</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.480" end="01:38:49.780" style="s2">capital K and you know we have to we</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.040" end="01:38:51.460" style="s2">have to disaggregate and in the case of</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.780" end="01:38:52.630" style="s2">human capital you know a plumber an</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.460" end="01:38:55.150" style="s2">electrician</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.630" end="01:38:58.960" style="s2">might have might might fit in the exact</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.150" end="01:39:00.790" style="s2">same you know middle skill or middle</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.960" end="01:39:02.410" style="s2">high school bracket but they have</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.790" end="01:39:04.270" style="s2">incredibly different kinds of human</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.410" end="01:39:06.310" style="s2">capital and all trishing can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.270" end="01:39:07.960" style="s2">job of a plumber and vice versa right</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.310" end="01:39:11.460" style="s2">and so it recognized that recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.960" end="01:39:15.220" style="s2">that heterogeneity I think is is</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.460" end="01:39:16.450" style="s2">incredibly important because and I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.220" end="01:39:17.920" style="s2">that&#39;s also important from like the</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.450" end="01:39:20.170" style="s2">perspective of pluralism that have been</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.920" end="01:39:23.050" style="s2">talking about like we we need an economy</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.170" end="01:39:28.060" style="s2">that is diversified enough that it</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.050" end="01:39:30.970" style="s2">captures it maximizes not just GDP but</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.060" end="01:39:33.730" style="s2">but human potential more generally right</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.970" end="01:39:35.590" style="s2">like you know we an economist that just</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.730" end="01:39:38.290" style="s2">said we shouldn&#39;t focus on GDP that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.590" end="01:39:39.350" style="s2">amazing no we should focus on GP in a</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.290" end="01:39:40.910" style="s2">sense but what</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.350" end="01:39:42.440" style="s2">what I&#39;m arguing is that actually when</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.910" end="01:39:44.000" style="s2">you take this dynamical perspective of</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.440" end="01:39:47.630" style="s2">perspective when you add time and you</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.000" end="01:39:50.600" style="s2">add heterogeneity it&#39;s actually gdp</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.630" end="01:39:52.610" style="s2">maximizing to to focus on those other</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.600" end="01:39:55.280" style="s2">people in the big as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.610" end="01:39:57.050" style="s2">alright like yeah exactly to focus under</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.280" end="01:39:58.790" style="s2">diversification in the exact same way</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.050" end="01:40:00.710" style="s2">that you know the lack of</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.790" end="01:40:03.950" style="s2">diversification of bangladesh means they</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.710" end="01:40:06.350" style="s2">are still stuck in that sweatshop call</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.950" end="01:40:09.650" style="s2">centre equilibrium they could be richer</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.350" end="01:40:12.710" style="s2">they could have higher GDP so but but</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.650" end="01:40:14.510" style="s2">but they&#39;re maximizing a function that</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.710" end="01:40:16.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have time in it right and and</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.510" end="01:40:18.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the the problem right and so in</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.940" end="01:40:19.970" style="s2">the united states what we did is we</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.140" end="01:40:22.610" style="s2">exported low-skilled low-skilled jobs</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.970" end="01:40:25.580" style="s2">but then but then we also begin to do</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.610" end="01:40:28.400" style="s2">something else we began to export like</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.580" end="01:40:32.260" style="s2">medium right we you were saying in this</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.400" end="01:40:33.950" style="s2">piece that we have lost our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.260" end="01:40:36.940" style="s2">complete this sort of manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.950" end="01:40:39.110" style="s2">chain right and there&#39;s actual really</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.940" end="01:40:42.170" style="s2">significant significant consequences of</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.110" end="01:40:45.080" style="s2">that right right so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.170" end="01:40:46.880" style="s2">expectation with trade liberalisation of</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.080" end="01:40:48.170" style="s2">china would it was it was gonna be like</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.880" end="01:40:50.660" style="s2">bangladesh all over again right like</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.170" end="01:40:53.120" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna since then you know the 90s</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.660" end="01:40:55.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve been importing cheap cheap toys so</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.120" end="01:40:56.270" style="s2">that&#39;s great like more more than more</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.100" end="01:41:00.200" style="s2">the merrier we&#39;re not going to make our</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.270" end="01:41:01.430" style="s2">plastic toys the issue is once once</p>

<p begin="01:41:33.830" end="01:41:37.940" style="s2">this is something that every country has</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.570" end="01:41:42.200" style="s2">done in history so America America</p>

<p begin="01:41:42.200" end="01:41:48.280" style="s2">wrote about this in the pieces well the</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.929" end="01:41:50.289" style="s2">a guy went over to Britain studied their</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.280" end="01:41:52.780" style="s2">textile factories committed it to memory</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.289" end="01:41:54.130" style="s2">right they didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t have at the</p>

<p begin="01:42:07.719" end="01:42:10.329" style="s2">every country should do it because we</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.769" end="01:42:12.969" style="s2">want every country to be rich right but</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.329" end="01:42:14.889" style="s2">but what we&#39;ve what we&#39;ve what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.969" end="01:42:18.429" style="s2">done what the United States has done is</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.889" end="01:42:21.400" style="s2">you know for years we sort of had a kind</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.429" end="01:42:23.679" style="s2">of Strauss in relationship with art with</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.400" end="01:42:25.059" style="s2">art with free trade where we said you</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.679" end="01:42:27.400" style="s2">know the right thing to do is liberalize</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.059" end="01:42:31.570" style="s2">and have a lazy fair economy right</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.400" end="01:42:34.900" style="s2">meanwhile we have you know DARPA and NIH</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.570" end="01:42:36.670" style="s2">and agricultural subsidies and and so we</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.900" end="01:42:38.229" style="s2">were hypocrites right but we we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.670" end="01:42:39.999" style="s2">ended up drinking our own kool-aid and</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.229" end="01:42:43.209" style="s2">forgot that we are being stressing that</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.999" end="01:42:44.619" style="s2">whole time and end up applying that that</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.209" end="01:42:46.389" style="s2">sort of World Bank new neoliberal</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.619" end="01:42:49.599" style="s2">doctrine on ourselves right and and the</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.389" end="01:42:52.179" style="s2">consequences of that are you know when a</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.599" end="01:42:54.639" style="s2">country like China doesn&#39;t follow that</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.179" end="01:42:56.709" style="s2">rule book and tries to invest in human</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.639" end="01:42:59.559" style="s2">capital and build new skills and new</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.709" end="01:43:01.329" style="s2">comparative advantages you know they</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.559" end="01:43:04.900" style="s2">don&#39;t they go from that labor-intensive</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.329" end="01:43:06.729" style="s2">thing to middle-skill jobs that are</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.900" end="01:43:08.739" style="s2">competitive with what the United States</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.729" end="01:43:11.019" style="s2">is exporting right it&#39;s a way you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.739" end="01:43:13.360" style="s2">what what you saw I think was in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.019" end="01:43:14.949" style="s2">piece you can please talk about it it</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.360" end="01:43:18.760" style="s2">was like one of the key elements that we</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.949" end="01:43:22.300" style="s2">have lost it&#39;s not just a guy on the</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.760" end="01:43:26.050" style="s2">factory floor doing rivets but actually</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.300" end="01:43:28.959" style="s2">higher up the value chain in machine</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.050" end="01:43:31.900" style="s2">tooling and small small manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.959" end="01:43:35.909" style="s2">things like that that then by not having</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.900" end="01:43:39.039" style="s2">this ecosystem of engineers workers</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.909" end="01:43:40.929" style="s2">manufacturers and the design right all</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.039" end="01:43:42.579" style="s2">in the same sort of place with the same</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.929" end="01:43:45.309" style="s2">language and working together and</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.579" end="01:43:48.969" style="s2">iterating together that we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.309" end="01:43:50.699" style="s2">severe loss in innovation yeah and a lot</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.969" end="01:43:54.909" style="s2">of wasted human potential right because</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.699" end="01:43:56.530" style="s2">it was called it is called like an MBA</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.909" end="01:43:57.520" style="s2">textbooks and stuff like that the open</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.530" end="01:43:58.960" style="s2">innovation model</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.520" end="01:44:00.460" style="s2">right and the idea behind the open</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.960" end="01:44:02.620" style="s2">innovation model is kind of captured</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.460" end="01:44:04.630" style="s2">when you look at your your iPhone box</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.620" end="01:44:07.600" style="s2">and it says you know designed in America</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.630" end="01:44:09.280" style="s2">manufactured in China right the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.600" end="01:44:12.040" style="s2">you know America is going to specialize</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.280" end="01:44:13.870" style="s2">in the the hard stuff we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.040" end="01:44:15.640" style="s2">the R&amp;D we&#39;re going to do the design the</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.870" end="01:44:17.920" style="s2">marketing and when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.640" end="01:44:19.390" style="s2">fabricating we you know Foxconn can do</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.920" end="01:44:21.460" style="s2">that for us right</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.390" end="01:44:25.260" style="s2">so we we do the innovation they do the</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.460" end="01:44:30.760" style="s2">fabrication the fallacy behind that is</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.260" end="01:44:33.610" style="s2">is that actually a lot of Technology a</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.760" end="01:44:36.130" style="s2">lot of innovation isn&#39;t captured in R&amp;D</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.610" end="01:44:38.230" style="s2">right like the cost of solar panels has</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.130" end="01:44:39.730" style="s2">been following exponentially not because</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.230" end="01:44:41.440" style="s2">they&#39;re spending a lot of money on R&amp;D</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.730" end="01:44:43.780" style="s2">they&#39;re spending with less than 1% I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.440" end="01:44:46.480" style="s2">nerdy it&#39;s because as you scale a</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.780" end="01:44:49.660" style="s2">business as you scale an industry you</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.480" end="01:44:51.190" style="s2">learn things just by doing it right like</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.660" end="01:44:52.450" style="s2">you you learned that there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.190" end="01:44:54.520" style="s2">way I can organize this production line</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.450" end="01:44:56.520" style="s2">that actually gets efficiencies and and</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.520" end="01:44:59.710" style="s2">and actually I don&#39;t need that that</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.520" end="01:45:01.720" style="s2">mineral to you know in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.710" end="01:45:03.430" style="s2">photocell I can I can substitute that</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.720" end="01:45:06.040" style="s2">was something else and and that drives</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.430" end="01:45:09.010" style="s2">down costs and is a form of innovation a</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.040" end="01:45:12.430" style="s2">really critical form of innovation but</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.010" end="01:45:14.350" style="s2">you you learn those you you discover</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.430" end="01:45:16.870" style="s2">those innovations by actually engaging</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.350" end="01:45:20.550" style="s2">in the in the production process itself</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.870" end="01:45:22.570" style="s2">right and so you know you have these</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.550" end="01:45:24.400" style="s2">Apple is a bit of an exception because</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.570" end="01:45:27.250" style="s2">Apple makes it a point to be very</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.400" end="01:45:28.630" style="s2">embedded with its suppliers right so you</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.250" end="01:45:30.850" style="s2">know there&#39;s a very direct line</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.630" end="01:45:32.830" style="s2">communication with Apple and and its</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.850" end="01:45:35.800" style="s2">foreign suppliers or they they are</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.830" end="01:45:37.570" style="s2">trying to avoid these problems but the</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.800" end="01:45:39.040" style="s2">fact that they have to do all this work</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.570" end="01:45:41.040" style="s2">to avoid it is is sort of a testament</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.040" end="01:45:44.260" style="s2">that is a problem because if you are</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.040" end="01:45:47.200" style="s2">instead a you know you design something</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.260" end="01:45:49.420" style="s2">for Kickstarter and then you then you go</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.200" end="01:45:50.620" style="s2">in Alibaba and find a manufacturer in</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.420" end="01:45:52.120" style="s2">China that will build it for you</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.620" end="01:45:54.160" style="s2">you get bet you get back something that</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.120" end="01:45:55.720" style="s2">looks nothing like what you wanted right</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.160" end="01:45:57.250" style="s2">and then if you want to fix it you have</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.720" end="01:46:01.780" style="s2">to actually work through translators and</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.250" end="01:46:03.130" style="s2">that that level of segmentation is</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.780" end="01:46:06.280" style="s2">really destructive to the technology</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.130" end="01:46:08.380" style="s2">cycle and it&#39;s not that we are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.280" end="01:46:12.040" style="s2">prevent China from becoming rich it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.380" end="01:46:16.360" style="s2">more that for trade to be actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.040" end="01:46:20.860" style="s2">you know positive-sum when when you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.360" end="01:46:22.420" style="s2">you know China can that that you know we</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.860" end="01:46:26.170" style="s2">can invest in ourselves and China can</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.420" end="01:46:31.990" style="s2">invest in ourselves and we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.170" end="01:46:34.630" style="s2">both come out ahead but if we are</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.990" end="01:46:36.010" style="s2">unilaterally saying no we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.630" end="01:46:38.140" style="s2">to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.010" end="01:46:40.240" style="s2">well someone well another country</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.140" end="01:46:42.850" style="s2">engages in aggressive industrial policy</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.240" end="01:46:44.290" style="s2">then that&#39;s essentially like laying in</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.850" end="01:46:45.550" style="s2">the fetal position while you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.290" end="01:46:48.010" style="s2">being beat up and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.550" end="01:46:50.140" style="s2">doing yeah and going back to what I said</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.010" end="01:46:52.030" style="s2">sir the beginning the podcast it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.140" end="01:46:53.770" style="s2">just bad you know it&#39;s not an indictment</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.030" end="01:46:55.780" style="s2">of globalization per se it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.770" end="01:46:58.090" style="s2">indictment of a particular approach to</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.780" end="01:46:59.740" style="s2">globalization that only captured half</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.090" end="01:47:01.780" style="s2">the benefits right it captured the</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.740" end="01:47:03.760" style="s2">benefits of the thing that the other</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.780" end="01:47:05.830" style="s2">country was selling but didn&#39;t capture</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.760" end="01:47:08.470" style="s2">the benefits of how that competition</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.830" end="01:47:11.290" style="s2">could actually allow us to move workers</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.470" end="01:47:14.230" style="s2">into higher productivity fields in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.290" end="01:47:15.220" style="s2">same way that that you know we moved</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.230" end="01:47:17.050" style="s2">workers from agriculture to</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.220" end="01:47:21.280" style="s2">manufacturing we can take workers that</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.050" end="01:47:23.020" style="s2">were once making furniture and you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.280" end="01:47:24.760" style="s2">they have a lot of tacit knowledge a lot</p>

<p begin="01:47:24.760" end="01:47:28.060" style="s2">are like you know like a basketball</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.650" end="01:47:28.570" style="s2">player has skill but you can&#39;t write it</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.060" end="01:47:30.850" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.570" end="01:47:33.280" style="s2">we could have repurposed that knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.850" end="01:47:36.220" style="s2">and in some way to do something even</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.280" end="01:47:38.320" style="s2">more high value but instead that person</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.220" end="01:47:43.720" style="s2">is a Walmart greeter or on disability</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.320" end="01:47:46.360" style="s2">and that means that we&#39;ve in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.720" end="01:47:50.220" style="s2">we only get half the benefits because in</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.360" end="01:47:54.370" style="s2">the process of in the process of that</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.220" end="01:47:56.320" style="s2">disruption we miss out on the creative</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.370" end="01:47:58.360" style="s2">side right like what you know Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.320" end="01:48:00.640" style="s2">Schumpeter called it you know creative</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.360" end="01:48:03.910" style="s2">destruction and just crave instruction</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.640" end="01:48:07.120" style="s2">is absolutely essential to a dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.910" end="01:48:08.980" style="s2">economy but we we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t not</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.120" end="01:48:11.830" style="s2">to having a nice life and you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.980" end="01:48:15.460" style="s2">Pennsylvania well no I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.830" end="01:48:16.630" style="s2">think that&#39;s why that isn&#39;t really curry</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.460" end="01:48:19.420" style="s2">obstruction that&#39;s just destruction</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.630" end="01:48:22.950" style="s2">right like the point that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.420" end="01:48:24.309" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to make is you know Germany</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.950" end="01:48:27.539" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.309" end="01:48:30.550" style="s2">a smaller version of the China shock</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.539" end="01:48:33.909" style="s2">denmark did as well very open economies</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.550" end="01:48:36.729" style="s2">but what did they do well because German</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.909" end="01:48:39.760" style="s2">workers are you know in trade</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.729" end="01:48:41.829" style="s2">organizations and have a lot bargaining</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.760" end="01:48:44.289" style="s2">power that their job just didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.829" end="01:48:46.119" style="s2">offshored and they were you know tossed</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.289" end="01:48:47.769" style="s2">the curb instead you know they work</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.119" end="01:48:49.239" style="s2">within the company to develop a new</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.769" end="01:48:51.369" style="s2">product line that that maybe China</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.239" end="01:48:52.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to do yet or is even</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.369" end="01:48:56.409" style="s2">more high value more precision</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.510" end="01:48:57.579" style="s2">manufacturing and and then then you</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.409" end="01:49:00.429" style="s2">still get the benefits of globalization</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.579" end="01:49:02.530" style="s2">China can still produce things that at</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.429" end="01:49:04.209" style="s2">lower cost and then they can but at the</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.530" end="01:49:06.999" style="s2">same time they&#39;re moving their workers</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.209" end="01:49:12.300" style="s2">in human capital into even a higher</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.999" end="01:49:15.010" style="s2">level of you know self-actualization so</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.300" end="01:49:17.829" style="s2">again the elites back in the 90s they</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.010" end="01:49:19.569" style="s2">failed they failed to just put put this</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.829" end="01:49:21.399" style="s2">type of thinking into the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.569" end="01:49:24.599" style="s2">and there was an adequate resources</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.399" end="01:49:27.689" style="s2">allocated to helping people shift both</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.599" end="01:49:30.249" style="s2">industries or types of jobs or within</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.689" end="01:49:33.249" style="s2">organizations themselves it was just all</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.249" end="01:49:35.619" style="s2">thrown on the altar of free trade and</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.249" end="01:49:38.939" style="s2">open trade and and let&#39;s get into the</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.619" end="01:49:42.429" style="s2">Chinese market and make some money and</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.939" end="01:49:44.530" style="s2">whether irrespective of whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.429" end="01:49:45.969" style="s2">think that the policy should be moving</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.530" end="01:49:49.300" style="s2">forward I think that we can agree on</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.969" end="01:49:52.749" style="s2">what the impact has been and the impact</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.300" end="01:49:55.749" style="s2">in many cases has led to urban-rural</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.749" end="01:49:57.969" style="s2">polarization the diminishment of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.749" end="01:50:00.929" style="s2">sort of middle worker economy in favor</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.969" end="01:50:04.209" style="s2">of the creative info class economy and</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.929" end="01:50:06.369" style="s2">to me even as troubling or more so is</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.209" end="01:50:08.349" style="s2">the loss of innovation in very specific</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.369" end="01:50:10.510" style="s2">industries that have national security</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.349" end="01:50:12.760" style="s2">implications right like can you talk a</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.510" end="01:50:16.539" style="s2">little bit about that I mean what is the</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.760" end="01:50:19.019" style="s2">u.s. capacity in more making or national</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.539" end="01:50:21.639" style="s2">security air defense and has it been</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.019" end="01:50:23.060" style="s2">eroded as a result of this loss of</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.639" end="01:50:24.890" style="s2">innovation from the</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.060" end="01:50:26.900" style="s2">you know the the iterative process of</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.890" end="01:50:31.840" style="s2">the middle manufacturing in the creative</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.900" end="01:50:35.420" style="s2">class etc oh I think you know absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.840" end="01:50:39.140" style="s2">this is not you know at my I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.420" end="01:50:41.630" style="s2">expert on on this issue at all but you</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.140" end="01:50:43.040" style="s2">see this playing out now with you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.630" end="01:50:45.830" style="s2">the one area of precision manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.040" end="01:50:48.410" style="s2">in the US has retained namely</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.830" end="01:50:52.940" style="s2">semiconductors right semiconductors are</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.410" end="01:50:55.100" style="s2">the brains of everything it&#39;s it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.940" end="01:50:56.720" style="s2">and the US has a lock on that right</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.100" end="01:51:01.120" style="s2">Silicon Valley is called Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.720" end="01:51:06.080" style="s2">for a reason the the skill involved in</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.120" end="01:51:07.430" style="s2">creating semiconductors is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.080" end="01:51:10.850" style="s2">machine tooling precision manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.430" end="01:51:13.600" style="s2">skill the kind that we lost across other</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.850" end="01:51:17.150" style="s2">sectors of the economy to China and and</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.600" end="01:51:22.130" style="s2">but semiconductors are kind of unique</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.150" end="01:51:25.280" style="s2">because for the same reason that you</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.130" end="01:51:28.070" style="s2">know the Huawei issue is kind of unique</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.280" end="01:51:30.650" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing to import you know toys</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.070" end="01:51:32.720" style="s2">another thing to import the network</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.650" end="01:51:34.580" style="s2">infrastructure for you convert your your</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.720" end="01:51:37.700" style="s2">the network in competing infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.580" end="01:51:41.360" style="s2">for your economy so I think that is one</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.700" end="01:51:43.760" style="s2">of the reasons why some of the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.360" end="01:51:47.210" style="s2">China Hawks and the US government are</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.760" end="01:51:49.940" style="s2">our national security folks right and</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.210" end="01:51:52.970" style="s2">the people of commerce who who are sort</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.940" end="01:51:54.980" style="s2">of most in favor of more a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.970" end="01:51:56.990" style="s2">industrial policy see this through the</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.980" end="01:51:59.120" style="s2">lens of national security now I think</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.990" end="01:52:04.040" style="s2">that the national security argument is</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.120" end="01:52:05.720" style="s2">true but it&#39;s even without the national</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.040" end="01:52:09.830" style="s2">security argument there are a great a</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.720" end="01:52:12.680" style="s2">great case for a more sort of public</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.830" end="01:52:17.960" style="s2">investment and quote-unquote industrial</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.680" end="01:52:20.960" style="s2">policy right so for for people who</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.960" end="01:52:22.900" style="s2">supported Trump or at least to get the</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.960" end="01:52:27.310" style="s2">general thrust of where he&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.900" end="01:52:29.600" style="s2">I think that China ascension to WTO</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.310" end="01:52:31.730" style="s2">hollowing out of the manufacturing class</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.600" end="01:52:33.620" style="s2">the reduction in some of our national</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.730" end="01:52:36.360" style="s2">security capabilities around this a lack</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.620" end="01:52:38.219" style="s2">of innovation and the constant</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.360" end="01:52:40.800" style="s2">of wealth and resources and</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.219" end="01:52:42.570" style="s2">opportunities in the cities those cities</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.800" end="01:52:45.690" style="s2">and being introductive interconnected</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.570" end="01:52:48.270" style="s2">globally has created the new oral urban</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.690" end="01:52:52.320" style="s2">divides and then then you add to that</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.270" end="01:52:54.869" style="s2">the financial crisis 2008-2009 total</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.320" end="01:52:56.670" style="s2">loss in faith and confidence in our</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.869" end="01:52:58.380" style="s2">financial industry the government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.670" end="01:53:00.179" style="s2">ability to manage these types of crises</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.380" end="01:53:02.130" style="s2">how are they going to respond who are</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.179" end="01:53:04.800" style="s2">they going to assist is it going to be</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.130" end="01:53:06.420" style="s2">saving AIG and Goldman Sachs or is it</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.800" end="01:53:10.079" style="s2">gonna be saving the lady that took out</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.420" end="01:53:12.719" style="s2">three trusts and a grant in order to buy</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.079" end="01:53:14.429" style="s2">her first home who&#39;s now losing it and</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.719" end="01:53:16.820" style="s2">and you know I think these things sort</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.429" end="01:53:20.400" style="s2">of add up and to people being very</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.820" end="01:53:22.770" style="s2">disgruntled with the way things are and</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.400" end="01:53:25.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve read another I read an article I</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.770" end="01:53:28.889" style="s2">can&#39;t remember her name now but she was</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.650" end="01:53:31.260" style="s2">identifying that the real class struggle</p>

<p begin="01:53:31.260" end="01:53:35.820" style="s2">lasting effect is actually the intra</p>

<p begin="01:53:41.699" end="01:53:48.000" style="s2">of 0.9 percentile of the economic sphere</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.730" end="01:53:50.670" style="s2">and what&#39;s happening there is that this</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.000" end="01:53:53.849" style="s2">specialization that has come out of a</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.670" end="01:53:55.500" style="s2">result of our trade policies is that the</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.849" end="01:53:58.349" style="s2">two things that were best at making</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.500" end="01:54:02.130" style="s2">these days are financial financial</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.349" end="01:54:03.900" style="s2">instruments that fund tech companies so</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.130" end="01:54:05.579" style="s2">and and and a lot of those tech</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.900" end="01:54:07.440" style="s2">companies aren&#39;t even designed to</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.579" end="01:54:09.690" style="s2">actually do anything super productive in</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.440" end="01:54:11.699" style="s2">the long run and so we&#39;ve got this whole</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.690" end="01:54:13.980" style="s2">new economy of just people making paper</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.699" end="01:54:15.750" style="s2">and getting money to give to other guys</p>

<p begin="01:54:18.210" end="01:54:22.889" style="s2">like an inordinate amount of the wealth</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.190" end="01:54:24.659" style="s2">and opportunity and it do you see any</p>

<p begin="01:54:24.659" end="01:54:29.250" style="s2">stuff because I mean I hate to lay it</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.949" end="01:54:30.750" style="s2">all on the foot of WTO but there does</p>

<p begin="01:58:06.410" end="01:58:12.620" style="s2">distraction isn&#39;t it yeah and I offered</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.020" end="01:58:13.940" style="s2">a kind of analysis of this in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.620" end="01:58:16.070" style="s2">context of other countries that have</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.940" end="01:58:17.600" style="s2">high marginal tax rates so you know a</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.070" end="01:58:20.000" style="s2">lot people don&#39;t know this but but</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.600" end="01:58:23.600" style="s2">Sweden has more billionaires per capita</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.000" end="01:58:27.230" style="s2">than the United States and if you break</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.600" end="01:58:30.680" style="s2">down if you you can look at Swedish and</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.230" end="01:58:31.940" style="s2">American wealth inequality Sweden has</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.680" end="01:58:37.100" style="s2">much higher levels of wealth inequality</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.940" end="01:58:38.930" style="s2">and and even probably similar or close</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.100" end="01:58:40.640" style="s2">to equal levels of income inequalities</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.930" end="01:58:42.080" style="s2">the United States once you factor in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.640" end="01:58:44.120" style="s2">fact that everyone&#39;s hiding their income</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.080" end="01:58:44.300" style="s2">in Luxembourg right if you adjust for</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.120" end="01:58:47.990" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.300" end="01:58:50.900" style="s2">um the but you know Sweden still has a</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.990" end="01:58:52.790" style="s2">relative you know they&#39;re they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.900" end="01:58:54.560" style="s2">compressed than the United States but</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.790" end="01:58:57.470" style="s2">the fact that they have high marginal</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.560" end="01:59:00.050" style="s2">tax rates one of the functions that</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.470" end="01:59:02.240" style="s2">serves is to make it very hard to create</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.050" end="01:59:04.280" style="s2">a new wealthy elite right there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.240" end="01:59:07.120" style="s2">very hard to accumulate the wealth to</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.280" end="01:59:11.960" style="s2">displace the incumbent right and this is</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.120" end="01:59:14.750" style="s2">this is part of a bargain and in Sweden</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.960" end="01:59:16.340" style="s2">Sweden is a you know a constitutional</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.750" end="01:59:17.079" style="s2">monarchy they have they have a literal</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.340" end="01:59:20.020" style="s2">noble</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.079" end="01:59:21.639" style="s2">like a literal aristocracy people with</p>

<p begin="01:59:21.639" end="01:59:27.929" style="s2">they they inhabit that top 10% right and</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.670" end="01:59:30.909" style="s2">um you know having high marginal taxes</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.929" end="01:59:32.290" style="s2">isn&#39;t just about helping it you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.909" end="01:59:35.679" style="s2">redistribution rush to the poor</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.290" end="01:59:38.170" style="s2">it&#39;s also you know making it so if you</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.679" end="01:59:40.690" style="s2">have one great year where you made you</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.170" end="01:59:42.639" style="s2">know five million dollars seventy</p>

<p begin="01:59:44.650" end="01:59:49.239" style="s2">it very that makes it harder for you to</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.860" end="01:59:52.659" style="s2">break into that noble class is this a</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.239" end="01:59:55.750" style="s2">good thing or a bad thing um I think</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.659" end="01:59:57.670" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly a bad thing right because it</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.750" end="01:59:59.679" style="s2">is your house I can say or you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.670" end="02:00:01.540" style="s2">earlier to our discussion about the kind</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.679" end="02:00:02.949" style="s2">of equality that matters if you think</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.540" end="02:00:06.309" style="s2">the kind of equality that matters is the</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.949" end="02:00:08.110" style="s2">avoidance of a new aristocracy or a new</p>

<p begin="02:00:12.010" end="02:00:17.619" style="s2">that that there&#39;s a churn and turnover</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.429" end="02:00:19.809" style="s2">in the system that that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.619" end="02:00:22.809" style="s2">sort of settle down into their privilege</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.809" end="02:00:24.130" style="s2">and pass it on intergenerationally right</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.809" end="02:00:25.659" style="s2">all right on that note we&#39;re gonna take</p>

<p begin="02:01:01.389" end="02:01:09.639" style="s2">day and Tyler attributed a lack of</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.010" end="02:01:11.079" style="s2">innovation perhaps and dynamism in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.639" end="02:01:13.449" style="s2">American economy to what he called the</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.079" end="02:01:16.000" style="s2">feminine ization of the economy are you</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.449" end="02:01:17.440" style="s2">familiar with the argument that he heard</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.000" end="02:01:18.790" style="s2">that podcast as well oh you did okay</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.440" end="02:01:20.320" style="s2">what did you think what did you think</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.790" end="02:01:22.570" style="s2">about what did you think about that</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.320" end="02:01:23.949" style="s2">podcast in general and then what do you</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.570" end="02:01:25.389" style="s2">think about that because I would have</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.949" end="02:01:28.059" style="s2">liked for Eric to really have drilled</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.389" end="02:01:29.770" style="s2">down a little bit deeper on that yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.059" end="02:01:30.410" style="s2">mean I follow Tyler Cowen sworkit I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.770" end="02:01:31.790" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.410" end="02:01:34.190" style="s2">since high school I thought that was one</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.790" end="02:01:37.850" style="s2">of the one of the better conversations</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.190" end="02:01:41.930" style="s2">he&#39;s had just because well I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.850" end="02:01:44.930" style="s2">out to Eric Weinstein for being such a</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.930" end="02:01:47.150" style="s2">generative person himself that he can</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.930" end="02:01:49.150" style="s2">come up with you know interesting topics</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.150" end="02:01:51.650" style="s2">and and and minds a conversation that</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.150" end="02:01:54.140" style="s2">you know Tyler probably doesn&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.650" end="02:01:56.570" style="s2">a standard news interview or something</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.140" end="02:01:58.430" style="s2">yeah yeah but what do you make of this</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.570" end="02:02:00.320" style="s2">sense that that there&#39;s been a lack of</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.430" end="02:02:03.920" style="s2">innovation within the American economy</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.320" end="02:02:05.720" style="s2">they didn&#39;t talk anything about the you</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.920" end="02:02:07.340" style="s2">know erosion of the supply chain as</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.720" end="02:02:09.200" style="s2">leading to that lack of innovation in</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.340" end="02:02:11.480" style="s2">fact they focused very narrowly on this</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.200" end="02:02:12.890" style="s2">idea of feminization do you do you even</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.480" end="02:02:15.380" style="s2">know what they mean by that because I</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.890" end="02:02:17.030" style="s2">actually did it I was under you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.380" end="02:02:19.880" style="s2">wondering if maybe you had had to take</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.030" end="02:02:21.620" style="s2">on a given year experience at George</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.880" end="02:02:23.570" style="s2">Mason and no surprise that you&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.620" end="02:02:24.560" style="s2">reader of marginal marginal revolution</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.570" end="02:02:27.140" style="s2">for quite some time</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.560" end="02:02:29.150" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an inflammatory way of</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.140" end="02:02:31.460" style="s2">putting things but I think the I can try</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.150" end="02:02:33.680" style="s2">to explain what I think the what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.460" end="02:02:37.040" style="s2">getting at yeah please do</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.680" end="02:02:39.680" style="s2">so you know one of my honors thesis was</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.040" end="02:02:42.230" style="s2">on the commerce of religion right and</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.680" end="02:02:44.540" style="s2">and my thesis was that religious</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.230" end="02:02:46.760" style="s2">organizations are basically sort of</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.540" end="02:02:49.310" style="s2">pseudo social insurance providers right</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.760" end="02:02:51.410" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you blow into a church you</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.310" end="02:02:53.870" style="s2">you have the community safety net that</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.410" end="02:02:55.400" style="s2">comes with that and potentially the</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.870" end="02:02:58.550" style="s2">expansion of the welfare state across</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.400" end="02:03:00.230" style="s2">that out right one of the things I</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.550" end="02:03:02.840" style="s2">discovered in researching that is that</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.230" end="02:03:05.390" style="s2">there is a very historic gender</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.840" end="02:03:07.430" style="s2">difference and risk preference because</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.390" end="02:03:09.830" style="s2">this is this is you know kind of obvious</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.430" end="02:03:11.300" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s men who died in</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.830" end="02:03:13.340" style="s2">motorcycle crashes it crashes and</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.300" end="02:03:18.160" style="s2">they&#39;re jumping out of planes right and</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.340" end="02:03:20.360" style="s2">as in general right and on average and</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.160" end="02:03:23.720" style="s2">you know to the extent that some of the</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.360" end="02:03:26.990" style="s2">trends over the last 30 years cultural</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.720" end="02:03:30.500" style="s2">trends like the decline of sort of free</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.990" end="02:03:37.090" style="s2">range parenting the fear of stranger</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.500" end="02:03:38.480" style="s2">danger the the kind of flight to safety</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.090" end="02:03:40.940" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.480" end="02:03:44.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of de-risking of society in</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.940" end="02:03:46.220" style="s2">some way alright and that that is you</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.900" end="02:03:48.410" style="s2">know one dimension in which you could</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.220" end="02:03:50.600" style="s2">describe that as a kind of feminization</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.410" end="02:03:53.180" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t put it in those terms because</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.600" end="02:03:54.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the feminization is what</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.180" end="02:03:57.460" style="s2">what you know I don&#39;t think the feminine</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.980" end="02:04:02.360" style="s2">part of it is what matters it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.460" end="02:04:07.400" style="s2">for for Tyler you know he&#39;s very you</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.360" end="02:04:11.480" style="s2">know my read of him is he&#39;s sort of he</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.400" end="02:04:14.720" style="s2">still has a kind of countercultural side</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.480" end="02:04:18.680" style="s2">to him growing up you know and in the</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.720" end="02:04:22.660" style="s2">60s that he values nonconformity right</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.680" end="02:04:25.610" style="s2">he values the out-of-the-box thinker and</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.660" end="02:04:26.990" style="s2">being himself sort of meta rational in a</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.610" end="02:04:31.460" style="s2">way that he doesn&#39;t get caught up in her</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.990" end="02:04:35.690" style="s2">herd mentality right and apply to the</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.460" end="02:04:39.320" style="s2">economy like Silicon Valley and its best</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.690" end="02:04:42.260" style="s2">was a is or was a place that rewards</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.320" end="02:04:44.870" style="s2">that kind of heterodox nonconformist</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.260" end="02:04:46.880" style="s2">mentality where you know everyone out</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.870" end="02:04:48.230" style="s2">east saying X is the only way to do</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.880" end="02:04:49.310" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna show them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.230" end="02:04:51.920" style="s2">not the only way to do something right</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.310" end="02:04:55.580" style="s2">and and to the extent that that is a</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.920" end="02:04:56.690" style="s2">driver of economic innovation and also</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.580" end="02:04:59.060" style="s2">the Rowling&#39;s to take risk the</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.690" end="02:05:00.920" style="s2">willingness to fail the willingness to</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.060" end="02:05:04.670" style="s2">be disagreeable and the Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.920" end="02:05:07.370" style="s2">put it yeah like all those things are</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.670" end="02:05:10.220" style="s2">essential and and there has been this</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.370" end="02:05:15.430" style="s2">broader sort of de-risking and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.220" end="02:05:17.420" style="s2">great book is looking around his office</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.430" end="02:05:21.230" style="s2">everything in the book but if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.420" end="02:05:23.420" style="s2">book about by Mark Levinson about the US</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.230" end="02:05:27.560" style="s2">economy since the 70s and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.420" end="02:05:30.590" style="s2">you know a lot of the a lot of the</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.560" end="02:05:32.900" style="s2">pathologies of our economy seemed</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.590" end="02:05:35.300" style="s2">somehow connected to the oil shock and</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.900" end="02:05:39.200" style="s2">the 70s right and the oil shock was a</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.300" end="02:05:42.440" style="s2">very traumatic event it it shook up a</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.200" end="02:05:47.770" style="s2">lot of our institutions but it also I</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.440" end="02:05:50.960" style="s2">think in some abstract sense like moved</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.770" end="02:05:52.730" style="s2">America&#39;s risks preference right it it</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.960" end="02:05:58.070" style="s2">made us feel like we were Valen</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.730" end="02:06:01.520" style="s2">right and it made us you know make</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.070" end="02:06:04.670" style="s2">things like you know oil oil and energy</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.520" end="02:06:07.190" style="s2">independence and and stuff like that or</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.670" end="02:06:09.890" style="s2">the expansion of sort of environmental</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.190" end="02:06:11.950" style="s2">regulation to de-risk the environment</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.890" end="02:06:16.850" style="s2">made all that stuff a higher priority</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.950" end="02:06:18.230" style="s2">and it became less about you know JFK we</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.850" end="02:06:20.840" style="s2">can go to the moon</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.230" end="02:06:21.740" style="s2">let&#39;s take big bold risks let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.840" end="02:06:27.050" style="s2">outside the box</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.740" end="02:06:31.700" style="s2">let&#39;s celebrate the eccentric and became</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.050" end="02:06:33.710" style="s2">more about safety right and and even in</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.700" end="02:06:39.080" style="s2">the sense of like consumer product</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.710" end="02:06:43.580" style="s2">safety right yeah and the the kind of</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.080" end="02:06:47.510" style="s2">you know the kind of idiom is you know</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.580" end="02:06:49.850" style="s2">if you are worried about a you know</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.510" end="02:06:52.430" style="s2">minimizing the worst outcomes you might</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.850" end="02:06:54.740" style="s2">accidentally cut off the best outcomes</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.430" end="02:06:55.940" style="s2">right crap yeah and so I think that</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.740" end="02:06:58.670" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that&#39;s what they were</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.940" end="02:07:01.040" style="s2">getting at but didn&#39;t go so far and Eric</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.670" end="02:07:03.500" style="s2">and Peter teal have had conversations</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.040" end="02:07:07.760" style="s2">about the lack of innovation in physics</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.500" end="02:07:10.700" style="s2">and in other areas of science and they</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.760" end="02:07:12.560" style="s2">both danced around this sort of topic</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.700" end="02:07:14.600" style="s2">the de-risking is a very nice way of</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.560" end="02:07:16.370" style="s2">putting it the feminization makes makes</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.600" end="02:07:17.810" style="s2">a little bit more sense to me and will</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.370" end="02:07:20.030" style="s2">to my audience because we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.810" end="02:07:22.070" style="s2">well-versed and sort of the general</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.030" end="02:07:23.600" style="s2">gender differences in terms of risk</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.070" end="02:07:26.720" style="s2">preferences and aggression and</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.600" end="02:07:30.530" style="s2">competition and such and such and I</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.720" end="02:07:34.790" style="s2">guess you can see it as its impact in</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.530" end="02:07:36.140" style="s2">the American economy as we&#39;re as you</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.790" end="02:07:37.430" style="s2">said sometimes you have to be</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.140" end="02:07:38.990" style="s2">disagreeable to get things done</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.430" end="02:07:41.690" style="s2">sometimes you have to be aggressive</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.990" end="02:07:43.340" style="s2">sometimes you have to take risks and and</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.690" end="02:07:45.770" style="s2">there&#39;s then been a shift in the</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.340" end="02:07:47.480" style="s2">corporate America also too as anyone</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.770" end="02:07:49.910" style="s2">who&#39;s engaged with an HR department can</p>

<p begin="02:08:00.650" end="02:08:04.099" style="s2">line and I just I wonder what the</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.410" end="02:08:06.290" style="s2">long-term</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.099" end="02:08:09.380" style="s2">the actual the real long-term effect of</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.290" end="02:08:10.849" style="s2">this would be I don&#39;t know that you</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.380" end="02:08:12.739" style="s2">people would argue against us but the</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.849" end="02:08:15.260" style="s2">American American ethos seemed seemed to</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.739" end="02:08:16.579" style="s2">have been masculine you know let&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.260" end="02:08:18.440" style="s2">on this country you land on this</p>

<p begin="02:08:26.060" end="02:08:31.190" style="s2">forward and that energy is being shifted</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.000" end="02:08:32.929" style="s2">around a little bit and towards de-risk</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.190" end="02:08:34.550" style="s2">orion feminization and i wonder what the</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.929" end="02:08:38.440" style="s2">long-term implications of that would be</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.550" end="02:08:41.409" style="s2">what i&#39;d add to that list is is</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.440" end="02:08:43.699" style="s2">vulgarity right like you know Trump&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:08:50.170" end="02:08:55.940" style="s2">tolerance for vulgarity like you know</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.849" end="02:08:59.329" style="s2">maybe people men in on their own don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="02:09:07.610" end="02:09:14.300" style="s2">some extent like the secret sauce of</p>

<p begin="02:09:14.300" end="02:09:17.780" style="s2">also a more vulgar cult culture right</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.550" end="02:09:20.150" style="s2">like you know there might be snooty</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.780" end="02:09:21.560" style="s2">Europeans who who look down on us</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.150" end="02:09:25.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re you know we&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.560" end="02:09:28.090" style="s2">know refined and genteel but the fact</p>

<p begin="02:09:37.520" end="02:09:43.699" style="s2">yeah like all that is actually that that</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.690" end="02:09:46.639" style="s2">level of vulgarity in that little level</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.699" end="02:09:50.840" style="s2">of sort of sort of acceptance of like a</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.639" end="02:09:52.489" style="s2">low trust or navigating a less less</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.840" end="02:09:55.190" style="s2">tight-knit trustful environment is</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.489" end="02:09:57.429" style="s2">actually super conducive to to</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.190" end="02:10:00.349" style="s2">innovation but and and but also</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.429" end="02:10:01.760" style="s2">assimilation like the right the good</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.349" end="02:10:03.170" style="s2">kind of integration because you could</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.760" end="02:10:06.409" style="s2">you could you know if you if you are</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.170" end="02:10:08.210" style="s2">Chinese you can move to to New York and</p>

<p begin="02:10:17.810" end="02:10:20.840" style="s2">you know you could think about like how</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.250" end="02:10:26.240" style="s2">Manhattan has turned into a shopping</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.840" end="02:10:30.080" style="s2">mall as another another form of</p>

<p begin="02:10:31.520" end="02:10:38.330" style="s2">because I feel like you know I feel like</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.790" end="02:10:40.190" style="s2">it&#39;s reifying something that that you</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.330" end="02:10:43.220" style="s2">can describe note and in other ways like</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.190" end="02:10:46.790" style="s2">I know there&#39;s the kind of you know</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.220" end="02:10:52.790" style="s2">order chaos yummy and stuff that that</p>

<p begin="02:10:56.200" end="02:11:03.680" style="s2">necessarily advances or I think you</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.820" end="02:11:05.600" style="s2">might end up losing you can find lots of</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.680" end="02:11:08.990" style="s2">ways where that where feminization might</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.600" end="02:11:11.180" style="s2">fit but if the theory isn&#39;t perfect or</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.990" end="02:11:14.000" style="s2">is if we&#39;re not getting the right term</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.180" end="02:11:17.390" style="s2">for it then we might be missing some</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.000" end="02:11:19.100" style="s2">higher level description that maybe we</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.390" end="02:11:21.440" style="s2">need to embrace your sense of all</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.100" end="02:11:23.810" style="s2">Garrety there to then just go for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.440" end="02:11:26.840" style="s2">there you go that&#39;s how you find the</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.810" end="02:11:29.960" style="s2">answer sometimes American vulgarity as a</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.840" end="02:11:32.720" style="s2">virtue of innovation it&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.960" end="02:11:34.340" style="s2">interesting and you know we I definitely</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.720" end="02:11:37.460" style="s2">use vulgarity as a signaling in my</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.340" end="02:11:39.830" style="s2">social media or as a way just to be like</p>

<p begin="02:11:43.790" end="02:11:48.470" style="s2">have to right and I think to the extent</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.460" end="02:11:50.660" style="s2">that the the decline in vulgarity or the</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.470" end="02:11:54.730" style="s2">acceptance of or political correctness</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.660" end="02:11:57.260" style="s2">what everyone call it and like it is</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.730" end="02:12:00.320" style="s2">incredibly stifling you know in the case</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.260" end="02:12:05.570" style="s2">of sort of science and academia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.320" end="02:12:08.360" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to be that eccentric a sort</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.570" end="02:12:10.610" style="s2">of crude professor like you know you</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.360" end="02:12:14.060" style="s2">know I think I think I think a turning</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.610" end="02:12:17.030" style="s2">point in in science an American</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.060" end="02:12:20.210" style="s2">scientific you know progress really was</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.030" end="02:12:22.310" style="s2">like the reprisal of James Watson who</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.210" end="02:12:27.400" style="s2">helped discovered the double helix</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.310" end="02:12:30.610" style="s2">structure the DNA okay and who harbored</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.400" end="02:12:35.150" style="s2">reactionary views about race right right</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.610" end="02:12:37.910" style="s2">and you know long after his career his</p>

<p begin="02:13:48.080" end="02:13:54.680" style="s2">broader willingness to to deviate right</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.520" end="02:13:56.990" style="s2">or engage in science of all kinds or</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.680" end="02:13:59.480" style="s2">discuss scientific ideas or just look at</p>

<p begin="02:14:01.310" end="02:14:06.850" style="s2">was was huge huge for me and for people</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.310" end="02:14:08.840" style="s2">in my audience and in our world because</p>

<p begin="02:14:31.130" end="02:14:35.750" style="s2">well how are those viewpoints working</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.740" end="02:14:37.640" style="s2">their way into the algorithms and into</p>

<p begin="02:28:54.050" end="02:28:59.210" style="s2">in Australia record you know not</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.690" end="02:29:01.940" style="s2">officially not officially but like they</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.210" end="02:29:04.430" style="s2">recognize MLK Day right and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.940" end="02:29:07.040" style="s2">there&#39;s part of American cultural</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.430" end="02:29:08.600" style="s2">hegemony is how how that has been export</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.040" end="02:29:10.880" style="s2">that that framing that frame of</p>

<p begin="02:29:10.880" end="02:29:16.790" style="s2">right has been exported to other places</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.510" end="02:29:18.620" style="s2">of different totally different cultures</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.790" end="02:29:22.880" style="s2">and frames of reference and I think that</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.620" end="02:29:24.290" style="s2">is a big problem I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.880" end="02:29:26.300" style="s2">existential threat to the United States</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.290" end="02:29:32.240" style="s2">though like I think there is this</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.300" end="02:29:34.040" style="s2">tension between the US Constitution the</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.240" end="02:29:37.550" style="s2">Bill of Rights has originally understood</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.040" end="02:29:41.240" style="s2">and you know the Civil Rights Act which</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.550" end="02:29:44.710" style="s2">which changed which created new vectors</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.240" end="02:29:47.780" style="s2">to for for new kinds of law that that</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.710" end="02:29:49.610" style="s2">are kind of pseudo constitutional but</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.780" end="02:29:54.230" style="s2">are upheld for prep because the</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.610" end="02:29:57.530" style="s2">President and and for me like I</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.230" end="02:29:59.000" style="s2">the best scenario I think if you spent</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.530" end="02:30:01.910" style="s2">too much your time focused on that you</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.000" end="02:30:04.011" style="s2">might put off vibes that you&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.910" end="02:30:05.030" style="s2">true reactionary that you think that you</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.011" end="02:30:06.740" style="s2">know maybe we should black people</p>

<p begin="02:30:06.740" end="02:30:11.391" style="s2">stuff like that whereas I think there is</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.200" end="02:30:15.230" style="s2">a version of that debate that tries to</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.391" end="02:30:17.811" style="s2">moderate it and say look if we there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.230" end="02:30:22.551" style="s2">there&#39;s a version of history where you</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.811" end="02:30:25.900" style="s2">know we we acknowledge the the unique</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.551" end="02:30:34.341" style="s2">and deep historical impact of slavery</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.900" end="02:30:37.221" style="s2">but we but the goal should to aspire to</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.341" end="02:30:41.330" style="s2">be a kind of post-racial society one</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.221" end="02:30:42.891" style="s2">where one where we don&#39;t need these</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.330" end="02:30:46.820" style="s2">special preferences when we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.891" end="02:30:50.601" style="s2">these sort of special pseudo</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.820" end="02:30:52.341" style="s2">constitutional legal protections and and</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.601" end="02:30:53.721" style="s2">I think that would moderate things</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.341" end="02:30:55.131" style="s2">because what you&#39;re basically saying is</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.721" end="02:30:57.200" style="s2">look we&#39;re not we don&#39;t want to go back</p>
<p begin="02:30:55.131" end="02:30:59.301" style="s2">to Jim Crow we want to become more like</p>

<p begin="02:30:59.301" end="02:31:02.841" style="s2">have the same history and therefore</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.681" end="02:31:05.511" style="s2">don&#39;t have this other extra extra</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.841" end="02:31:08.330" style="s2">constitutional framework that sort of</p>
<p begin="02:31:05.511" end="02:31:11.271" style="s2">crudely pasted on top right well that</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.330" end="02:31:13.521" style="s2">book last I looked was like number one</p>
<p begin="02:31:11.271" end="02:31:15.230" style="s2">almost in all of Amazon number one in</p>
<p begin="02:31:13.521" end="02:31:17.540" style="s2">politics number one in government never</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.230" end="02:31:19.131" style="s2">in philosophy I think it&#39;s gonna be read</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.540" end="02:31:21.230" style="s2">by a ton of people I mean it&#39;s just sold</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.131" end="02:31:22.910" style="s2">a ton of copies I think but I was</p>
<p begin="02:31:21.230" end="02:31:25.311" style="s2">familiar with the general argument but I</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.910" end="02:31:27.771" style="s2">will definitely pick that up I just want</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.311" end="02:31:32.601" style="s2">to ask you one more question before we</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.771" end="02:31:36.950" style="s2">go what is your take on ubi universal</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.601" end="02:31:40.131" style="s2">basic income overrated overrated okay</p>
<p begin="02:31:36.950" end="02:31:44.030" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s all you got yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.131" end="02:31:46.580" style="s2">I so someone like Andrew yang you know I</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.030" end="02:31:48.290" style="s2">if I could vote I&#39;d be in the anging</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.580" end="02:31:52.730" style="s2">okay but that&#39;s partly because I think</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.290" end="02:31:54.351" style="s2">that Yang&#39;s got the he has the right he</p>
<p begin="02:31:52.730" end="02:31:56.150" style="s2">is a broadly right diagnosis like I</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.351" end="02:31:57.200" style="s2">think you know when he talks about</p>
<p begin="02:31:56.150" end="02:31:59.450" style="s2">automation he&#39;s really talking about</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.200" end="02:32:01.790" style="s2">offshoring it&#39;s sort of a quibble about</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.450" end="02:32:06.230" style="s2">the edges but I think his orientation is</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.790" end="02:32:07.489" style="s2">to say let&#39;s transcend a dandy politics</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.230" end="02:32:09.439" style="s2">because that&#39;s alienating</p>
<p begin="02:32:07.489" end="02:32:13.579" style="s2">and he&#39;s able to do that in part because</p>
<p begin="02:32:09.439" end="02:32:16.879" style="s2">he is is a asian man right math star and</p>
<p begin="02:32:13.579" end="02:32:18.729" style="s2">and to say no we&#39;re focused on economic</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.879" end="02:32:20.959" style="s2">issues and we&#39;re going to focus on</p>
<p begin="02:32:18.729" end="02:32:22.819" style="s2">future the future right like we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:32:20.959" end="02:32:25.039" style="s2">to need to orient our agenda to the</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.819" end="02:32:28.279" style="s2">future and part of his also I think is</p>
<p begin="02:32:25.039" end="02:32:30.350" style="s2">part of his agenda is sort of rebuilding</p>
<p begin="02:32:28.279" end="02:32:31.819" style="s2">American state capacity to actually do</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.350" end="02:32:34.520" style="s2">things to respond to crises like the</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.819" end="02:32:37.100" style="s2">opioid epidemic to - you know innovate</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.520" end="02:32:39.770" style="s2">in new areas and I think that is where</p>
<p begin="02:32:37.100" end="02:32:43.039" style="s2">the country needs to be focused so I</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.770" end="02:32:45.859" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily agree with the UVI as</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.039" end="02:32:48.799" style="s2">a specific policy because I think a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.859" end="02:32:50.600" style="s2">too expensive and be and kind of</p>
<p begin="02:32:48.799" end="02:32:52.159" style="s2">misunderstands social insurance like</p>
<p begin="02:32:50.600" end="02:32:54.919" style="s2">social insurance is about pooling risks</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.159" end="02:32:58.759" style="s2">so you know you if your house burns down</p>
<p begin="02:32:54.919" end="02:33:00.379" style="s2">you get redistribution from from people</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.759" end="02:33:01.609" style="s2">whose houses didn&#39;t burn down right</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.379" end="02:33:03.109" style="s2">there and the same insurance pools you</p>
<p begin="02:33:01.609" end="02:33:04.430" style="s2">and there&#39;s all kinds of things like</p>
<p begin="02:33:03.109" end="02:33:06.439" style="s2">that in social insurance if you get</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.430" end="02:33:09.350" style="s2">unemployed you have an unemployment</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.439" end="02:33:11.149" style="s2">insurance it&#39;s not about a flat transfer</p>
<p begin="02:33:09.350" end="02:33:12.470" style="s2">and in fact like you can&#39;t reduce</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.149" end="02:33:15.199" style="s2">everything to a flat transfer that</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.470" end="02:33:17.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m I&#39;m not for things that</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.199" end="02:33:20.089" style="s2">are like ubi for example I do a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:33:17.390" end="02:33:22.069" style="s2">advocacy around child allowances I might</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.089" end="02:33:24.020" style="s2">go and be my last question right and I</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.069" end="02:33:26.799" style="s2">think that in that case it&#39;s a child</p>
<p begin="02:33:24.020" end="02:33:29.119" style="s2">allowance is a bit different than ubi</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.799" end="02:33:31.249" style="s2">because if you think about it you know</p>
<p begin="02:33:29.119" end="02:33:34.039" style="s2">the market doesn&#39;t care if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.249" end="02:33:38.329" style="s2">parent or not you get the same wage for</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.039" end="02:33:39.829" style="s2">the same job and but you have an</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.329" end="02:33:43.159" style="s2">additional mouth to feed right and so</p>
<p begin="02:33:39.829" end="02:33:46.009" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of market failure with</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.159" end="02:33:48.589" style="s2">parenting because you know the economic</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.009" end="02:33:50.600" style="s2">system is doesn&#39;t is unaware of</p>
<p begin="02:33:48.589" end="02:33:52.220" style="s2">fertility and being a thing right then</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.600" end="02:33:54.979" style="s2">we have these we have this biology that</p>
<p begin="02:33:52.220" end="02:33:57.799" style="s2">we can&#39;t actually overcome like this is</p>
<p begin="02:33:54.979" end="02:33:59.419" style="s2">who what humans are humans live they</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.799" end="02:34:01.999" style="s2">have families and give birth and they</p>
<p begin="02:33:59.419" end="02:34:03.289" style="s2">die that&#39;s what humans do and going back</p>
<p begin="02:34:01.999" end="02:34:06.430" style="s2">to like the metaphor of like molding</p>
<p begin="02:34:03.289" end="02:34:09.699" style="s2">institutions to the hand you know the</p>
<p begin="02:34:06.430" end="02:34:12.470" style="s2">you your most fertile years are also</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.699" end="02:34:14.089" style="s2">relatively low income years right like</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.470" end="02:34:16.930" style="s2">your peak fertility your peak earnings</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.089" end="02:34:19.129" style="s2">are in your 40s and 50s and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.930" end="02:34:20.650" style="s2">gap between when you have the resources</p>
<p begin="02:34:19.129" end="02:34:23.650" style="s2">to actually</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.650" end="02:34:26.170" style="s2">family and when when you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="02:34:23.650" end="02:34:27.881" style="s2">start a family and interesting and the</p>
<p begin="02:34:26.170" end="02:34:30.370" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s a flat a child allowance</p>
<p begin="02:34:27.881" end="02:34:32.320" style="s2">just a flat sir like a ubi for kids it</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.370" end="02:34:34.511" style="s2">that that structure makes sense because</p>
<p begin="02:34:32.320" end="02:34:37.540" style="s2">you&#39;re basically creating an income</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.511" end="02:34:39.730" style="s2">stream for that extra dependent that you</p>
<p begin="02:34:37.540" end="02:34:41.561" style="s2">have right well if you started catching</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.730" end="02:34:43.061" style="s2">as ubi for kids I think it might get</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.561" end="02:34:44.471" style="s2">more traction actually it&#39;s not a bad</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.061" end="02:34:46.360" style="s2">way of putting it it&#39;s kind of traction</p>
<p begin="02:34:44.471" end="02:34:48.160" style="s2">yeah people who people would understand</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.360" end="02:34:49.631" style="s2">that okay we have covered just a</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.160" end="02:34:51.070" style="s2">tremendous amount of ground here I</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.631" end="02:34:53.381" style="s2">really appreciate how gracious you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.070" end="02:34:55.000" style="s2">been with your time I won&#39;t take up any</p>
<p begin="02:34:53.381" end="02:34:56.381" style="s2">more of it but I do hope that we could</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.000" end="02:34:59.381" style="s2">pick this up again sometime in the</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.381" end="02:35:01.181" style="s2">future it&#39;s been I was gonna ask you at</p>
<p begin="02:34:59.381" end="02:35:02.830" style="s2">the very end you know who would you vote</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.181" end="02:35:04.240" style="s2">for and you already came out you would</p>
<p begin="02:35:02.830" end="02:35:06.400" style="s2">say you would be in the yang gang well I</p>
<p begin="02:35:04.240" end="02:35:10.721" style="s2">know you got to go but I want it to just</p>
<p begin="02:35:06.400" end="02:35:15.131" style="s2">like like challenge you on why do I</p>
<p begin="02:35:10.721" end="02:35:16.330" style="s2">support Trump like I understand D so</p>
<p begin="02:35:15.131" end="02:35:18.790" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing called the fallacy of</p>
<p begin="02:35:16.330" end="02:35:20.761" style="s2">mood affiliation fallacy of mood</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.790" end="02:35:23.471" style="s2">affiliation right so like for example</p>

<p begin="02:43:13.670" end="02:43:17.210" style="s2">that was bubbling up through the country</p>

<p begin="02:43:46.221" end="02:43:48.650" style="s2">actually the probably the most</p>

<p begin="02:43:50.900" end="02:43:56.120" style="s2">American politics that that Trump has</p>
<p begin="02:43:54.230" end="02:43:59.240" style="s2">usefully blown open like asking you know</p>

<p begin="02:43:59.240" end="02:44:05.380" style="s2">freeride or what why you know why are we</p>

<p begin="02:44:10.490" end="02:44:14.000" style="s2">blowing open you know what sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:44:12.230" end="02:44:16.070" style="s2">called like the horizons of possibility</p>
<p begin="02:44:14.000" end="02:44:17.630" style="s2">like thinking beyond our horizon so I I</p>

<p begin="02:44:17.630" end="02:44:22.010" style="s2">the one and there&#39;s truth to that but in</p>
<p begin="02:44:20.271" end="02:44:23.360" style="s2">this is where the mood affiliation comes</p>
<p begin="02:44:22.010" end="02:44:25.851" style="s2">back in and it&#39;s like well the people</p>
<p begin="02:44:23.360" end="02:44:28.400" style="s2">who argue that also don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="02:44:25.851" end="02:44:29.900" style="s2">should be impeached and and and it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="02:44:30.830" end="02:44:35.240" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a grouping a correlation</p>
<p begin="02:44:33.800" end="02:44:37.221" style="s2">between what you believe like why should</p>

<p begin="02:44:44.150" end="02:44:50.391" style="s2">out to your audience is just you can you</p>
<p begin="02:44:47.510" end="02:44:52.790" style="s2">know you can try to step outside these</p>
<p begin="02:44:50.391" end="02:44:56.000" style="s2">dynamics and and that&#39;s what the the</p>

<p begin="02:45:02.300" end="02:45:08.510" style="s2">threatens is is a kind of group</p>

<p begin="02:45:35.070" end="02:45:43.250" style="s2">right and and and and and not trying to</p>
<p begin="02:45:38.720" end="02:45:47.311" style="s2">not not inadvertently creating a kind of</p>
<p begin="02:45:43.250" end="02:45:49.110" style="s2">mirror image of the the thing that</p>

<p begin="02:45:49.110" end="02:45:53.780" style="s2">well I we had this conversation maybe it</p>
<p begin="02:45:51.990" end="02:45:56.040" style="s2">was before we started recording but I</p>
<p begin="02:45:53.780" end="02:45:57.420" style="s2">understand that the power the presidency</p>
<p begin="02:45:56.040" end="02:45:58.830" style="s2">is limited and I understand that the</p>
<p begin="02:45:57.420" end="02:46:00.390" style="s2">nature of our government is to slow</p>
<p begin="02:45:58.830" end="02:46:02.311" style="s2">things down and to end up in some sort</p>
<p begin="02:46:00.390" end="02:46:03.870" style="s2">of gridlock and that that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="02:46:02.311" end="02:46:05.250" style="s2">because that means that if things are</p>
<p begin="02:46:03.870" end="02:46:07.290" style="s2">gonna really change that there has to be</p>
<p begin="02:46:05.250" end="02:46:09.570" style="s2">really far-reaching support for that</p>
<p begin="02:46:07.290" end="02:46:11.130" style="s2">kind of stuff so I never thought that by</p>
<p begin="02:46:09.570" end="02:46:13.230" style="s2">electing Donald Trump were we gonna all</p>
<p begin="02:46:11.130" end="02:46:14.910" style="s2">of a sudden have some massive radical</p>
<p begin="02:46:13.230" end="02:46:16.860" style="s2">shift in policy and everything all</p>
<p begin="02:46:14.910" end="02:46:19.470" style="s2">across the board and we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="02:46:16.860" end="02:46:21.210" style="s2">Nazism and go to war and you know kill</p>
<p begin="02:46:19.470" end="02:46:22.830" style="s2">everybody no I didn&#39;t think any of that</p>
<p begin="02:46:21.210" end="02:46:25.830" style="s2">what I wanted to do was change to the</p>
<p begin="02:46:22.830" end="02:46:29.521" style="s2">conversation and I wanted I wanted there</p>
<p begin="02:46:25.830" end="02:46:31.590" style="s2">to be very specific emphasis on things</p>
<p begin="02:46:29.521" end="02:46:33.271" style="s2">that I mentioned like title 9 for</p>
<p begin="02:46:31.590" end="02:46:37.280" style="s2">example I mean that that is such a</p>
<p begin="02:46:33.271" end="02:46:39.420" style="s2">far-reaching and powerful just stroke of</p>

<p begin="02:49:59.540" end="02:50:02.840" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:50:00.830" end="02:50:04.010" style="s2">analogous with you know a lot of the</p>

<p begin="02:50:23.150" end="02:50:26.750" style="s2">supported a Hillary Clinton presidency</p>
<p begin="02:50:25.370" end="02:50:28.479" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way I could do the same</p>

<p begin="02:50:34.430" end="02:50:38.720" style="s2">know that I can put my support behind</p>
<p begin="02:50:36.260" end="02:50:40.700" style="s2">him either so there would come up you</p>
<p begin="02:50:38.720" end="02:50:42.830" style="s2">know I&#39;m a pragmatic guy so I&#39;m like all</p>
<p begin="02:50:40.700" end="02:50:44.120" style="s2">right well what is there to do could I</p>
<p begin="02:50:42.830" end="02:50:45.890" style="s2">you you said that you would have voted</p>
<p begin="02:50:44.120" end="02:50:48.830" style="s2">for Garrett you know Gary Johnson in</p>
<p begin="02:50:45.890" end="02:50:51.260" style="s2">2016 it was it&#39;s a joke cause he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:50:48.830" end="02:50:53.720" style="s2">Canadian and is it it&#39;s a joke anyway</p>
<p begin="02:50:51.260" end="02:50:56.630" style="s2">but but the point is is you know Jill</p>
<p begin="02:50:53.720" end="02:50:59.540" style="s2">Stein these types of protest votes which</p>
<p begin="02:50:56.630" end="02:51:01.550" style="s2">is what they are don&#39;t actually do</p>
<p begin="02:50:59.540" end="02:51:04.760" style="s2">anything and you&#39;re in a position of</p>
<p begin="02:51:01.550" end="02:51:06.290" style="s2">power where you you do generate vote</p>
<p begin="02:51:04.760" end="02:51:09.410" style="s2">collars regular votes don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="02:51:06.290" end="02:51:11.810" style="s2">well of course it is irrational to vote</p>
<p begin="02:51:09.410" end="02:51:13.729" style="s2">we know this right Bryan Caplan beat me</p>
<p begin="02:51:11.810" end="02:51:16.280" style="s2">over the head with it when I was but</p>
<p begin="02:51:13.729" end="02:51:18.110" style="s2">just an undergrad telling me how voting</p>
<p begin="02:51:16.280" end="02:51:20.090" style="s2">was a completely irrational activity to</p>
<p begin="02:51:18.110" end="02:51:22.340" style="s2">do because the expected outcome is zero</p>
<p begin="02:51:20.090" end="02:51:25.100" style="s2">and the investment in order to do it is</p>
<p begin="02:51:22.340" end="02:51:27.350" style="s2">very high so it&#39;s totally irrational but</p>
<p begin="02:51:25.100" end="02:51:28.820" style="s2">you know somebody&#39;s got to do it and no</p>
<p begin="02:51:27.350" end="02:51:31.430" style="s2">right but I think there&#39;s a lesson here</p>
<p begin="02:51:28.820" end="02:51:32.860" style="s2">which is you know if your vote doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:51:31.430" end="02:51:36.290" style="s2">matter because there&#39;s so many people</p>
<p begin="02:51:32.860" end="02:51:38.720" style="s2">you have to find your source of leverage</p>
<p begin="02:51:36.290" end="02:51:40.550" style="s2">right so in my work you know I do a lot</p>
<p begin="02:51:38.720" end="02:51:43.250" style="s2">of advocacy I work on the hill you know</p>
<p begin="02:51:40.550" end="02:51:44.300" style="s2">I work you know I work in intellectual</p>
<p begin="02:51:43.250" end="02:51:45.620" style="s2">debates but there&#39;s intellectual debates</p>
<p begin="02:51:44.300" end="02:51:47.660" style="s2">are ultimately about driving some kind</p>
<p begin="02:51:45.620" end="02:51:51.500" style="s2">of wedge that lets me get actual things</p>
<p begin="02:51:47.660" end="02:51:54.140" style="s2">done right so you know my leverage is</p>
<p begin="02:51:51.500" end="02:51:57.590" style="s2">not about joining team a or team B right</p>
<p begin="02:51:54.140" end="02:51:59.180" style="s2">it&#39;s about trying to step outside that</p>
<p begin="02:51:57.590" end="02:52:01.190" style="s2">so I can actually navigate the</p>
<p begin="02:51:59.180" end="02:52:02.510" style="s2">coalitions that let me you know pass</p>
<p begin="02:52:01.190" end="02:52:04.760" style="s2">legislation that</p>
<p begin="02:52:02.510" end="02:52:06.529" style="s2">has more impact than my vote right right</p>
<p begin="02:52:04.760" end="02:52:08.810" style="s2">it&#39;s weird that I can have meetings of</p>
<p begin="02:52:06.529" end="02:52:10.340" style="s2">senators by now I devote right and I</p>
<p begin="02:52:08.810" end="02:52:11.990" style="s2">think you know in in the general public</p>
<p begin="02:52:10.340" end="02:52:14.510" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of ways you can find</p>
<p begin="02:52:11.990" end="02:52:17.060" style="s2">leverage well this is my leverage this</p>
<p begin="02:52:14.510" end="02:52:19.460" style="s2">is my way no and I totally agree with</p>
<p begin="02:52:17.060" end="02:52:21.350" style="s2">that like having a podcast doing media</p>
<p begin="02:52:19.460" end="02:52:25.760" style="s2">that that is a form of leverage I just</p>
<p begin="02:52:21.350" end="02:52:27.170" style="s2">yeah you just you think I&#39;m wrong no I</p>
<p begin="02:52:25.760" end="02:52:28.609" style="s2">think that you know I think someone like</p>
<p begin="02:52:27.170" end="02:52:30.680" style="s2">Eric Weinstein is a model for how you</p>
<p begin="02:52:28.609" end="02:52:32.029" style="s2">can save we&#39;re gonna be heterodox around</p>
<p begin="02:52:30.680" end="02:52:34.430" style="s2">challenge things but I&#39;m not he&#39;s not on</p>

<p begin="02:52:40.580" end="02:52:45.170" style="s2">been excruciating to watch because he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:52:47.060" end="02:52:50.750" style="s2">it&#39;s excruciating because you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="02:52:48.500" end="02:52:52.220" style="s2">he has similarity with you on mood but</p>
<p begin="02:52:50.750" end="02:52:53.899" style="s2">he hasn&#39;t made the leap into the tribe</p>
<p begin="02:52:52.220" end="02:52:56.779" style="s2">right and that&#39;s and that&#39;s because he</p>
<p begin="02:52:53.899" end="02:52:58.130" style="s2">won&#39;t he won&#39;t take that action he won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="02:53:01.760" end="02:53:06.380" style="s2">as possible do you I mean to the extent</p>
<p begin="02:53:05.330" end="02:53:07.430" style="s2">that the Democratic Party looks</p>
<p begin="02:53:06.380" end="02:53:08.810" style="s2">radically different than it did 10 years</p>
<p begin="02:53:07.430" end="02:53:10.520" style="s2">ago it could look a radically different</p>
<p begin="02:53:08.810" end="02:53:14.990" style="s2">than it does 10 years from now right it</p>
<p begin="02:53:10.520" end="02:53:16.939" style="s2">is immature the Tea Party radically</p>
<p begin="02:53:14.990" end="02:53:18.620" style="s2">changed the Republican Party before that</p>

<p begin="02:54:56.301" end="02:55:00.950" style="s2">it would be all worth it to me and he</p>
<p begin="02:54:57.650" end="02:55:02.960" style="s2">did and he did and I see that as a</p>
<p begin="02:55:00.950" end="02:55:05.480" style="s2">really a seminal event in American</p>
<p begin="02:55:02.960" end="02:55:07.280" style="s2">culture and it hasn&#39;t just making these</p>

<p begin="02:55:24.261" end="02:55:29.631" style="s2">place where I want to go but again I was</p>
<p begin="02:55:28.131" end="02:55:31.700" style="s2">a Democrat my whole life so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="02:55:29.631" end="02:55:33.801" style="s2">socially open-minded you know when gay</p>
<p begin="02:55:31.700" end="02:55:36.830" style="s2">marriage came off the table that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="02:55:33.801" end="02:55:38.841" style="s2">I opened up my mind to Republicans once</p>
<p begin="02:55:36.830" end="02:55:41.030" style="s2">that was settled law as a proponent</p>
<p begin="02:55:38.841" end="02:55:43.011" style="s2">myself as of gay marriage whether that</p>
<p begin="02:55:41.030" end="02:55:44.900" style="s2">was settled law I was like whoo that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:55:43.011" end="02:55:47.000" style="s2">one less thing I have to be worried</p>
<p begin="02:55:44.900" end="02:55:49.341" style="s2">about and when Trump candidate and end</p>
<p begin="02:55:47.000" end="02:55:52.030" style="s2">president has come out and in high favor</p>
<p begin="02:55:49.341" end="02:55:55.011" style="s2">of marijuana or cannabis legalization</p>
<p begin="02:55:52.030" end="02:55:57.351" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing that was off my off</p>
<p begin="02:55:55.011" end="02:55:59.631" style="s2">my table right or off the list of things</p>
<p begin="02:55:57.351" end="02:56:01.761" style="s2">that could that specifically precluded</p>
<p begin="02:55:59.631" end="02:56:03.650" style="s2">me from participating in Republican</p>
<p begin="02:56:01.761" end="02:56:05.000" style="s2">Party and I would argue that a number of</p>
<p begin="02:56:03.650" end="02:56:07.431" style="s2">those social issues have already been</p>
<p begin="02:56:05.000" end="02:56:10.370" style="s2">decided and so it&#39;s now now we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="02:56:07.431" end="02:56:12.170" style="s2">to sort of look at some other issues and</p>
