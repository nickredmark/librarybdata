<p begin="00:01:16.620" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">integral terminology at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">integral theory is the idea that</p>

<p begin="00:02:58.329" end="00:03:02.170" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s clear that each of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.489" end="00:03:06.010" style="s2">previous ways of seeing the world has</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.170" end="00:03:07.569" style="s2">value and needs to be integrated this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.010" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">seems like a really good point to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.569" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson yeah what do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:18.370" style="s2">think his success is due to as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:22.329" style="s2">started to get this both polarization</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.370" end="00:03:25.799" style="s2">and and then included regression in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.329" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">cases these absolute istic retry belies</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.799" end="00:03:31.180" style="s2">points of view where people again if</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">they were discussing their tribe they</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.180" end="00:03:35.500" style="s2">were saying this is what my tribe has in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:37.569" style="s2">common with this tribe and this tribe</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:39.700" style="s2">and this service is this is how my types</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.569" end="00:03:41.620" style="s2">different from that tribe you need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.700" end="00:03:46.829" style="s2">serve some sort of special something or</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.620" end="00:03:49.180" style="s2">other and again there very well could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.829" end="00:03:52.359" style="s2">tribes that deserves special attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.180" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">certainly but the point is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.359" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">just emphasizing that and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:04:01.150" style="s2">emphasizing how that tribe is part of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:03.880" style="s2">unified overall tribal structure then</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.150" end="00:04:06.849" style="s2">that is just retry belies a ssin that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.880" end="00:04:09.819" style="s2">regression and the only ultimate end</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.849" end="00:04:12.989" style="s2">point of that really is just warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.819" end="00:04:17.079" style="s2">I&#39;m he&#39;s just no way around it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.989" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">humanity fought 300 thousand years to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.079" end="00:04:22.419" style="s2">get over that stage so among other</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.919" style="s2">things it could bring in women&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.419" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">and bring in an industry</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.919" end="00:04:30.050" style="s2">and bring in the end of the intouchables</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:35.529" style="s2">and start including every minority you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.050" end="00:04:39.949" style="s2">can think of LGBTQ transgender this was</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.529" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">extraordinary but as I started to fall</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.949" end="00:04:48.919" style="s2">apart and get rocking went started to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:51.499" style="s2">get left out as green became just</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.919" end="00:04:53.659" style="s2">extreme absolute istic and started</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.499" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">devolving into neol ism and narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.659" end="00:05:01.180" style="s2">or even regressed to absolutist</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:04.719" style="s2">ethnocentric the only people you had</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.180" end="00:05:08.090" style="s2">supporting these original liberal values</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.719" end="00:05:09.979" style="s2">which are absolutely crucial to any</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.090" end="00:05:12.169" style="s2">higher stage the whole point about these</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.979" end="00:05:14.810" style="s2">stage is the development is that each</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.169" end="00:05:18.379" style="s2">higher stage again transcends but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.810" end="00:05:20.680" style="s2">includes the previous stage and grand</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.379" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">and transcendence include orange</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.680" end="00:05:26.749" style="s2">transcended and repressed orange that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:30.349" style="s2">definition of pathology that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.749" end="00:05:33.620" style="s2">real problems with that so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.349" end="00:05:37.509" style="s2">an integral thinker and they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.620" end="00:05:40.310" style="s2">out there to see what is really missing</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.509" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">is that&#39;s what that&#39;s how and it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:44.689" style="s2">thinker thinks is wait there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:46.819" style="s2">bit of truth in all of this however we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.689" end="00:05:48.469" style="s2">including all of these things and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.819" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">thinking that way and you look out there</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.469" end="00:05:56.089" style="s2">and and if you are for example a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:58.069" style="s2">professor teaching at the university one</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.089" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">of the things you start to notice is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.069" end="00:06:03.529" style="s2">this extraordinary lack of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:06.770" style="s2">liberal values</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.529" end="00:06:10.490" style="s2">those aren&#39;t protective those you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.770" end="00:06:13.909" style="s2">some lip service to them but again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.490" end="00:06:16.610" style="s2">usually in terms of words like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.909" end="00:06:18.139" style="s2">quality and as we&#39;ve seen there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.610" end="00:06:19.939" style="s2">different definitions of equality</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.139" end="00:06:22.550" style="s2">there&#39;s orange their quality receives</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.939" end="00:06:25.789" style="s2">freedom and there&#39;s green equality which</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.550" end="00:06:29.750" style="s2">means equity equal outcome versus equal</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.789" end="00:06:33.349" style="s2">opportunity and so some of the right of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:37.330" style="s2">course for supporting that and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.349" end="00:06:40.289" style="s2">the people like Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.330" end="00:06:43.300" style="s2">head had set of challenges I&#39;m no longer</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.289" end="00:06:45.370" style="s2">leftist and what became real clear is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.300" end="00:06:49.300" style="s2">that left and liberal were no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.370" end="00:06:51.819" style="s2">same the old original leftists were</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.300" end="00:06:56.159" style="s2">liberals but the new leftists were</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.819" end="00:07:00.009" style="s2">illiberal x&#39; they&#39;re anti liberal and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.159" end="00:07:03.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a disaster you can&#39;t go forward</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.009" end="00:07:05.289" style="s2">with that kind of pathology and so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.460" end="00:07:07.419" style="s2">you&#39;re somebody like Jordan Peterson who</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.289" end="00:07:09.669" style="s2">is thinking integrally and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.419" end="00:07:12.280" style="s2">looking around and seeing what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.669" end="00:07:14.710" style="s2">is going on and you&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.280" end="00:07:16.419" style="s2">notice this and then the government</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.710" end="00:07:20.919" style="s2">comes along and says oh and by the way</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:54.129" style="s2">the net went viral and the main cause of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.460" end="00:07:58.990" style="s2">that in my opinion is that is these</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.129" end="00:08:01.529" style="s2">orange liberal values of equal</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:26.710" style="s2">disaster and that was the thing that at</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.500" end="00:08:31.509" style="s2">least put Jordan Peterson on the map and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.710" end="00:08:36.149" style="s2">he was arguing against Bill c16 because</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.509" end="00:08:39.190" style="s2">not only that it put into law a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.149" end="00:08:42.339" style="s2">constructivist view of human identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.190" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">that was his complaint it had nothing to</p>

<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:50.260" style="s2">attacked him for being anti transgender</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.100" end="00:08:52.960" style="s2">had absolutely nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.260" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">to do with that he&#39;s very clear about</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:09:04.120" style="s2">what it was was putting into actual law</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.390" end="00:09:20.020" style="s2">is an attack on free speech in the worst</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.020" end="00:09:23.950" style="s2">fascinating about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.910" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">watching especially the maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.950" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2">series is that he is also attempting a</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.270" end="00:09:44.650" style="s2">maps onto yours and what are the core</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.610" end="00:09:48.490" style="s2">differences there are a couple of</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.490" end="00:09:55.140" style="s2">theory that could come to play in here</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.610" end="00:10:00.130" style="s2">and and I want to make it as</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.140" end="00:10:07.480" style="s2">non-academic as as as as possible one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.130" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">the things that I have a really really</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.480" end="00:10:16.840" style="s2">deep appreciation of Jordan Peterson for</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">is the process that I call showing has</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.840" end="00:10:23.160" style="s2">to do with what we call four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:26.200" style="s2">and I can I can make that fairly simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.160" end="00:10:28.750" style="s2">by saying that the four quadrants for</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.200" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">example will shake down into things like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.750" end="00:10:34.420" style="s2">the good the true and the beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:39.550" style="s2">people are fairly aware of that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:41.470" style="s2">a very widely known widely accepted sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.550" end="00:10:43.630" style="s2">of Trinity of different types of</p>

<p begin="00:10:43.630" end="00:10:49.030" style="s2">different types of methods that we use</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.790" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">and they each have a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.030" end="00:10:55.930" style="s2">truth but those whose differ point about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">Jordan Pederson is that he has an</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.930" end="00:11:04.500" style="s2">enormous amount of respect for objective</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:04.500" style="s2">science and he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.630" end="00:11:10.730" style="s2">anchoring or at least correlating what</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.750" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">he&#39;s saying with some sort of neuro</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.730" end="00:11:15.710" style="s2">physiological research or</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:18.530" style="s2">anthropological research or at big five</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.710" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">factor analysis research or so on but</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.530" end="00:11:23.900" style="s2">what he realizes is that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:27.530" style="s2">other validity claims that aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.900" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">objective material exterior truth and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.530" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">these other things are damned important</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:36.890" style="s2">as a matter of fact they are important</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:40.850" style="s2">and one of the disasters of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.890" end="00:11:43.880" style="s2">alignment was that it ended up going</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.850" end="00:11:46.670" style="s2">from an understanding where what it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.880" end="00:11:48.980" style="s2">emphasizing critic Charles Taylor the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.670" end="00:11:50.660" style="s2">most dominant idea in the Western</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.980" end="00:11:51.590" style="s2">enlightenment was what the French</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.660" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">philosophers called</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.590" end="00:11:57.980" style="s2">the system de la nature the great whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.350" style="s2">interlocking system as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.980" end="00:12:04.070" style="s2">John Locke actually called it the great</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.070" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">common idea in the Western enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.470" end="00:12:11.780" style="s2">according to author Lovejoy where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:13.010" style="s2">great chain of being and we usually</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.780" end="00:12:14.660" style="s2">don&#39;t think of that with the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.010" end="00:12:19.250" style="s2">Enlightenment but the great chain of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.660" end="00:12:21.500" style="s2">being was a viewpoint of reality that as</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.250" end="00:12:24.080" style="s2">luxury demonstrates in his book called</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.500" end="00:12:27.170" style="s2">the great chain of being is the single</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.080" end="00:12:30.370" style="s2">most lively adopted overall philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.170" end="00:12:33.230" style="s2">that that the larger percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.370" end="00:12:35.870" style="s2">sensitive educated men and women have</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.230" end="00:12:39.170" style="s2">adopted throughout virtually all of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.870" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">civilizations up to and including the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.170" end="00:12:43.580" style="s2">Western enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:47.330" style="s2">so when lesser enlightenment started</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.580" end="00:12:49.790" style="s2">doing when when the Keppler was</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.330" end="00:12:52.520" style="s2">measuring planetary motion and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.790" end="00:12:54.470" style="s2">Galilee was measuring earthly motion and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.520" end="00:12:57.860" style="s2">Newton was measuring gravitation and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.470" end="00:13:00.110" style="s2">laws of motion none of them were worried</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.860" end="00:13:01.670" style="s2">about being reductionist it because they</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.110" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">all believed in the great interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.670" end="00:13:05.840" style="s2">order and they all believed in the great</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:08.300" style="s2">chain being so they weren&#39;t worried</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.840" end="00:13:09.650" style="s2">about anything happening to that but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.300" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">problem is they were continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.650" end="00:13:16.110" style="s2">basically measure all of this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:19.050" style="s2">you can&#39;t really measure these interior</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.110" end="00:13:22.620" style="s2">left hand subjective and inner</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.050" end="00:13:25.950" style="s2">subjective realities very well you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.620" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">measure exterior matter well and through</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.950" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">the more science kept going forward the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:34.769" style="s2">more the Enlightenment ended up almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:36.390" style="s2">accidentally with an official philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.769" end="00:13:40.529" style="s2">of what&#39;s often called scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.390" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">materialism and so yes we believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.529" end="00:13:44.730" style="s2">whole interlocking order of nature but</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:47.820" style="s2">only as far as you can see it in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.730" end="00:13:50.490" style="s2">objective materialistic way it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.820" end="00:13:54.060" style="s2">holistic and spheria interwoven this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.490" end="00:13:56.940" style="s2">all exterior objective truth so it has</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.060" end="00:13:57.930" style="s2">no interiors there&#39;s no beauty there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.940" end="00:14:01.200" style="s2">no morals</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.930" end="00:14:03.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no aesthetics there&#39;s no love</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.200" end="00:14:07.730" style="s2">there&#39;s none of that fits into a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.300" end="00:14:13.230" style="s2">standard Systems Theory doesn&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:16.860" style="s2">Peterson at the very least intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.230" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">knows that those quadrants are real</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.860" end="00:14:25.829" style="s2">those dimensions are real and not only</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:28.890" style="s2">that they govern how we interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.829" end="00:14:32.970" style="s2">world around us and again that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.890" end="00:14:36.180" style="s2">the minor true but partial aspects that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.970" end="00:14:39.149" style="s2">post-modernism came up with which is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.180" end="00:14:42.060" style="s2">world isn&#39;t just a perception it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.149" end="00:14:44.430" style="s2">conception it&#39;s an interpretation we</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.060" end="00:14:46.680" style="s2">have to interpret these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.430" end="00:14:49.260" style="s2">see that&#39;s an important partial truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.680" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">and nobody denies that including</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.260" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">Peterson which is why the things he</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:57.260" style="s2">attacks in post-modernism are all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:14:59.910" style="s2">extremest regressive you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.260" end="00:15:02.790" style="s2">outrageously idiotic aspects of it but</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.910" end="00:15:04.890" style="s2">he still uses some of its core ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.790" end="00:15:06.770" style="s2">because those are real in that there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.890" end="00:15:09.720" style="s2">he uses him and he knows it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.770" end="00:15:12.449" style="s2">but he&#39;s looking at these interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.720" end="00:15:16.699" style="s2">schemes and he&#39;s really attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.449" end="00:15:19.890" style="s2">find out what those are and one of his</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.699" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">closely allied issues to that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.890" end="00:15:25.709" style="s2">looking at totalitarian systems and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">saying why does that happen and became</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.709" end="00:15:29.930" style="s2">by his own account quite obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:34.520" style="s2">that for decades</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.930" end="00:15:41.400" style="s2">and I very much enjoy his conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.520" end="00:15:44.340" style="s2">but so he has these notion of maps of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.400" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">meaning and then he would frequently</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.340" end="00:15:54.450" style="s2">start referring to those as archetype oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:56.100" style="s2">and and that&#39;s the way he for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.450" end="00:15:58.890" style="s2">would start interpreting religion and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.100" end="00:16:01.290" style="s2">and he&#39;s given all these recent you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.890" end="00:16:03.420" style="s2">several hour-long talks about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.290" end="00:16:05.010" style="s2">every aspect of Genesis and he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.420" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">moving you know through the Bible and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.010" end="00:16:13.470" style="s2">doing that and all of that is it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:17.820" style="s2">important and I agree with a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.470" end="00:16:20.580" style="s2">of that that a lot of times when it</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.820" end="00:16:23.910" style="s2">comes to Jordan Peterson it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.580" end="00:16:26.730" style="s2">not that I&#39;ll disagree with much of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.910" end="00:16:28.770" style="s2">he says I agree with much of what he</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.730" end="00:16:33.390" style="s2">says it&#39;s some of the things that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.770" end="00:16:36.420" style="s2">leaves out and I find this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.390" end="00:16:37.410" style="s2">interesting because he&#39;s clearly an</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.420" end="00:16:45.930" style="s2">integral thinker</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.410" end="00:16:52.380" style="s2">and let me let me give one more example</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.930" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">of what second-tier means using a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.380" end="00:17:00.180" style="s2">well researched developmental model that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:02.870" style="s2">was developed by Michael Commons and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.180" end="00:17:08.930" style="s2">Richards and they just call it a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.870" end="00:17:13.290" style="s2">hierarchical model but we really have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.930" end="00:17:16.290" style="s2">emphasize the understanding that there</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.290" end="00:17:18.750" style="s2">are two types of hierarchies and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.290" end="00:17:20.870" style="s2">what Greene absolutely overlooks and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.750" end="00:17:23.699" style="s2">it&#39;s a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.870" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">there are Dominator hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.699" end="00:17:28.740" style="s2">there are growth hierarchies or</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.050" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">tyrannical their power structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.300" end="00:17:42.870" style="s2">they&#39;re oppressive they&#39;re the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.860" end="00:17:47.100" style="s2">almost every nightmare you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.870" end="00:17:51.360" style="s2">in human history and you want to do as</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.100" end="00:17:53.940" style="s2">much as you can to get rid of those as</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:56.789" style="s2">much as you possibly can but then there</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:17:59.580" style="s2">are growth hierarchies those are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.789" end="00:18:02.370" style="s2">opposite of done literally the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.580" end="00:18:03.870" style="s2">of Dominator hierarchies in a dominate</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.370" end="00:18:05.549" style="s2">are those the same thing as what</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.870" end="00:18:10.740" style="s2">Peterson would describe as hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.549" end="00:18:13.830" style="s2">of competence close to it the Dominator</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.740" end="00:18:15.480" style="s2">hierarchies the higher you go in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.830" end="00:18:17.100" style="s2">Dominator hierarchy the more people you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.480" end="00:18:20.850" style="s2">can oppress the more people you can hurt</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.100" end="00:18:23.429" style="s2">the more exclusive you are the higher</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.850" end="00:18:26.370" style="s2">you go in a growth hierarchy the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.429" end="00:18:29.340" style="s2">inclusive you are you actually are</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.370" end="00:18:30.899" style="s2">including more people we saw this simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.340" end="00:18:33.779" style="s2">developmental model that goes from just</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.899" end="00:18:37.230" style="s2">me to a group to all groups to all</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.779" end="00:18:43.159" style="s2">humans to integrating all of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.230" end="00:18:48.419" style="s2">that&#39;s a growth hierarchy and the was so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.159" end="00:18:51.299" style="s2">ironic and horrifying is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.419" end="00:18:55.500" style="s2">postmodernist in their streamer collapse</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.299" end="00:18:59.340" style="s2">these and so they don&#39;t see that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.500" end="00:19:02.250" style="s2">values that they represent to the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.340" end="00:19:06.299" style="s2">they represent value so egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.250" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">values for example or values of identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.299" end="00:19:14.039" style="s2">or diversity you&#39;re not born with those</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:17.399" style="s2">values and out of those sort of six to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.039" end="00:19:20.190" style="s2">eight stages of development there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.399" end="00:19:23.100" style="s2">one stage that has those values and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.190" end="00:19:27.270" style="s2">that&#39;s green but green is a result of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.100" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">about five stages of growth hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.270" end="00:19:32.610" style="s2">development and when you pull the rug</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:35.279" style="s2">out from under all hierarchies you pull</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.610" end="00:19:38.909" style="s2">the rug out you pull a ladder out from</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.279" end="00:19:41.700" style="s2">getting to your own values a suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.909" end="00:19:43.409" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely self-destructive and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.700" end="00:19:45.330" style="s2">in a sense you&#39;ve almost given up on</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.409" end="00:19:48.029" style="s2">that and that&#39;s why they end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.330" end="00:19:50.840" style="s2">just very absolute istic and just sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.029" end="00:19:53.789" style="s2">of yelling slogans and regressing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:56.370" style="s2">ethnocentric and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.789" end="00:20:01.020" style="s2">so these higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.370" end="00:20:03.299" style="s2">he&#39;s are clearly important and by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.020" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">way just that whole notion of a growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.299" end="00:20:10.380" style="s2">hierarchy Peterson rather famously</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:13.049" style="s2">traced it back to lobsters and he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.380" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">simply trying to demonstrate that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.049" end="00:20:20.549" style="s2">that some of these hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:22.440" style="s2">absolutely necessary we can&#39;t get around</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.549" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">them and they&#39;re certainly not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.440" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">product of Western capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">tyrannical patriarchy they backed like</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:33.230" style="s2">whatever&#39;s 350 million years or</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.429" style="s2">something like that to to the lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.230" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">but in fact those kinds of growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.429" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">hierarchies which are also author</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:45.659" style="s2">Kessler coined the term whole Larkin</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">because each of its stages is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.659" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">lung and a whole line is a whole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:53.580" style="s2">part of a larger whole and almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:56.820" style="s2">everything in the in the universe is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.580" end="00:20:59.399" style="s2">colon and so even if you go back into a</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.399" end="00:21:04.700" style="s2">sequence going all the way back to the</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.149" end="00:21:17.399" style="s2">each one of those is getting more</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.399" end="00:21:20.520" style="s2">inclusive and they transcend and include</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.399" end="00:21:22.820" style="s2">literally molecules go beyond atoms but</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.520" end="00:21:26.010" style="s2">they enfold them they include them</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.820" end="00:21:29.309" style="s2">molecules don&#39;t hate atoms they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:37.320" style="s2">they&#39;re actually hugging them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.590" end="00:21:39.390" style="s2">what growth hierarchies do and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.320" end="00:21:44.460" style="s2">really serious about values of inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.390" end="00:21:47.669" style="s2">and diversity and comprehensiveness you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.460" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">need a growth hole are key you need a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.669" end="00:21:55.230" style="s2">growth hierarchy and by the way the only</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.230" end="00:22:00.029" style="s2">are people at lower stages on growth</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.659" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">hierarchies and everybody on a higher</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.590" end="00:22:08.490" style="s2">to do it and that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.149" end="00:22:10.110" style="s2">postmodernist were criticizing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.490" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">because they were at this</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.110" end="00:22:15.510" style="s2">relatively high stage of development</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">even as they started to go extreme and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.510" end="00:22:26.760" style="s2">sort of mess it up so the one area where</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">I would like to see Peterson give more</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.760" end="00:22:36.380" style="s2">attention is that is the actual amount</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.490" style="s2">of research we have on growth</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.280" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">certain reason that that those tended to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:58.410" style="s2">drop out of academia and that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:23:02.340" style="s2">1960s as we said in 1959 the percent of</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.500" end="00:24:34.310" style="s2">managed to take over education in terms</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.650" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">conservative was about four to one today</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:55.650" style="s2">about 20 to 1 as peterson will say there</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.770" end="00:24:59.160" style="s2">just are no conservatives and human</p>

<p begin="00:25:05.190" end="00:25:15.870" style="s2">these things in the 60s as Green started</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.510" end="00:25:20.970" style="s2">to emerge and this is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.870" end="00:25:23.940" style="s2">that we don&#39;t see much of a discussion</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.730" end="00:25:40.730" style="s2">because they&#39;ve confused growth</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.710" end="00:25:46.710" style="s2">hierarchies and Dominator priorities and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.730" end="00:25:48.780" style="s2">so during the 40s and 50s and some a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.710" end="00:25:51.870" style="s2">earlier we had all of these really</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.090" end="00:26:06.060" style="s2">all of the sort of dozen or so multiple</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.409" end="00:26:40.919" style="s2">on just sort of one of these lines so PA</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.429" end="00:26:43.350" style="s2">tended to focus on cognitive development</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.919" end="00:26:44.999" style="s2">Kohlberg tended to focus on moral</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.429" end="00:26:58.049" style="s2">understanding of that at that time but</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.580" end="00:27:00.769" style="s2">the research they were doing was really</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.049" end="00:27:06.029" style="s2">good and the stages they came up with</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.769" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">again showed both the differences that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.029" end="00:27:10.379" style="s2">were actually there because they were</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:17.460" style="s2">the stages were essentially similar and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.090" end="00:27:22.740" style="s2">you could map those across all of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.460" end="00:27:25.320" style="s2">lines but in the 60s as Green starts to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.740" end="00:27:27.529" style="s2">emerge and come into the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.320" end="00:27:32.340" style="s2">particularly as it starts to take over</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.529" end="00:27:35.429" style="s2">academia what started to happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.340" end="00:27:39.559" style="s2">all systems that had anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.429" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">hierarchies were thrown out and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.559" end="00:27:45.269" style="s2">developmental psychology itself was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:47.340" style="s2">devastated by that I mean there were</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.269" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">entire departments of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.340" end="00:27:53.749" style="s2">psychology just closing down and so a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.059" end="00:27:55.590" style="s2">lot of the really really great</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.749" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">developmental is the really pioneering</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.590" end="00:28:01.350" style="s2">ones that we still look at today in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.490" end="00:28:04.100" style="s2">sense they all circled the wagons is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.350" end="00:28:07.019" style="s2">Harvard Graduate School of Education and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.100" end="00:28:10.379" style="s2">so you know interestingly they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.019" end="00:28:12.149" style="s2">in the psychology department</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.379" end="00:28:15.059" style="s2">the psychology had already gotten rid of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.149" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">all those nasty hierarchies but in</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.059" end="00:28:18.299" style="s2">education you actually had to produce</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:20.519" style="s2">results you had to actually educate</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.299" end="00:28:23.190" style="s2">people so you actually had to know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.519" end="00:28:24.929" style="s2">stages they went through so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.190" end="00:28:26.580" style="s2">developmentalist SAR over in the Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.929" end="00:28:30.029" style="s2">Graduate School of Education I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.580" end="00:28:32.220" style="s2">really the great ones um Lawrence</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.029" end="00:28:34.740" style="s2">Kohlberg was there Jane Levinger was</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.220" end="00:28:37.379" style="s2">there Fisher was there Howard Gardner</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.740" end="00:28:41.580" style="s2">was there Robert Keegan was there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.379" end="00:28:43.970" style="s2">it was outrageous and and they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.580" end="00:28:47.450" style="s2">over there basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.970" end="00:28:50.300" style="s2">doing that and at interval Institute we</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.450" end="00:28:52.940" style="s2">sent a lot of students out to distending</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.300" end="00:28:55.850" style="s2">with them these are some really really</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.940" end="00:29:04.690" style="s2">great people people like Robert Keegan</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.850" end="00:29:09.910" style="s2">and so but the whole even topic of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.690" end="00:29:13.100" style="s2">developmental studies was just</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.910" end="00:29:14.810" style="s2">immediately read as a wingman you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.100" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">saying this person is better than this</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.810" end="00:29:20.210" style="s2">person and in Renault and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:26.090" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.210" end="00:29:29.090" style="s2">I mean you mr. social activist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.090" end="00:29:32.300" style="s2">saying it&#39;s better not to be prejudiced</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.090" end="00:29:34.130" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s better to be to treat</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.130" end="00:29:40.250" style="s2">color sex or creed that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.550" end="00:29:42.740" style="s2">growth hierarchies are saying they said</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.250" end="00:29:45.890" style="s2">that those values are the result of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.740" end="00:29:47.780" style="s2">several stages of growth you&#39;re not at</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.890" end="00:29:49.490" style="s2">six months old you&#39;re not born with</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.780" end="00:29:54.440" style="s2">those values and you&#39;re running around</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.490" end="00:29:56.690" style="s2">the little you know sign protesting but</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.440" end="00:30:00.500" style="s2">it just sort of fell out of academia</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.690" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">discussion almost entirely and even</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.500" end="00:30:05.990" style="s2">smart people who know about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:07.070" style="s2">importance of hierarchies and the</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.070" end="00:30:14.620" style="s2">hierarchies and inequality hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.730" end="00:30:18.830" style="s2">it&#39;s just not a topic that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.620" end="00:30:21.320" style="s2">enter their awareness because mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.830" end="00:30:24.650" style="s2">any of the schooling they got it really</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.320" end="00:30:27.020" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a topic ever and services</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.650" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">something is kind of dropped off the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.020" end="00:30:32.630" style="s2">radar and it&#39;s one of the reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:36.020" style="s2">when we talk about an integral framework</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.630" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">those are one of the areas that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.020" end="00:30:40.580" style="s2">include because there is an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:44.050" style="s2">amount of evidence for them and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.580" end="00:30:47.540" style="s2">particular they have such a strong</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.050" end="00:30:51.380" style="s2">explanatory power they help us</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.540" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">understand what&#39;s happening and what and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.380" end="00:30:57.930" style="s2">and the sort of summary of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:31:00.300" style="s2">is that as we look at the culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.930" end="00:31:03.390" style="s2">what we find just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.300" end="00:31:06.840" style="s2">developmental studies is that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.390" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">this this whole first tier set of stages</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.840" end="00:31:12.360" style="s2">the highest three the three that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:14.820" style="s2">most recently occurred and are still</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.360" end="00:31:17.610" style="s2">present everybody is born in square one</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.820" end="00:31:19.730" style="s2">and has to move through these so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.610" end="00:31:22.440" style="s2">still have a fair number of people at</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.730" end="00:31:25.020" style="s2">ethnocentric fair enough people at</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.440" end="00:31:28.680" style="s2">orange world centric and fair another</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.680" end="00:31:34.650" style="s2">those upper three are at each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.250" end="00:31:35.160" style="s2">throats they really don&#39;t like each</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.160" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;ve increasingly come to hate each</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.650" end="00:31:42.570" style="s2">other in many ways and they&#39;re at each</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:44.910" style="s2">other&#39;s throats and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.570" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">because their offers tear they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.910" end="00:31:51.480" style="s2">solve that problem ever was by</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.960" end="00:31:54.630" style="s2">definition first here thinks that if</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.480" end="00:31:58.230" style="s2">dyes are the only correct ones but</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.630" end="00:32:01.650" style="s2">second tier that has the inherent</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.230" end="00:32:03.690" style="s2">capacity to see the importance of all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.650" end="00:32:06.450" style="s2">these and at least start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.690" end="00:32:09.060" style="s2">ways okay since everybody has to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.450" end="00:32:12.030" style="s2">through all of these then an enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.060" end="00:32:14.250" style="s2">society would include ways to help us do</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.030" end="00:32:18.990" style="s2">that and so that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.250" end="00:32:20.790" style="s2">that is a way out of the culture wars in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.990" end="00:32:22.620" style="s2">addition to whatever else we might need</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.790" end="00:32:25.950" style="s2">to do and there are plenty of other</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.620" end="00:32:27.630" style="s2">things but this is crucial because if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.950" end="00:32:31.230" style="s2">still have people that really are at</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.169" end="00:33:23.549" style="s2">actual developmental maps of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.620" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">happens at these stages if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.549" end="00:33:27.809" style="s2">Commons and Richards for example or if</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:31.650" style="s2">you look at Kurt Fisher if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.809" end="00:33:34.850" style="s2">any of the stages that are trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.650" end="00:33:37.140" style="s2">specifically ok this is what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.850" end="00:33:39.540" style="s2">mathematical reasoning or in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.140" end="00:33:41.250" style="s2">reasoning or in emotional awareness or</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.540" end="00:33:45.030" style="s2">in aesthetics or so on</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.250" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">and they lay them out as I said one or</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.030" end="00:33:50.370" style="s2">several of the things that tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:52.169" style="s2">laid out at the meta systemic level one</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:54.780" style="s2">is that it&#39;s just that it&#39;s meta</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.169" end="00:33:56.970" style="s2">systemic it introduces the fourth person</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.780" end="00:34:00.570" style="s2">perspective it just means it can reflect</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.970" end="00:34:03.690" style="s2">on the universal third-person</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.570" end="00:34:06.299" style="s2">perspectives that orange brought into</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.690" end="00:34:08.790" style="s2">existence and that we&#39;re so profound for</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.299" end="00:34:11.129" style="s2">the Western world but that fourth person</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.790" end="00:34:14.369" style="s2">perspective is a capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.129" end="00:34:16.740" style="s2">reflect on that and make sort of certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.369" end="00:34:19.950" style="s2">critical announcements about it it can</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.740" end="00:34:22.340" style="s2">appreciate it or it can disagree with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.950" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">but it can do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.340" end="00:34:29.899" style="s2">Peterson does that he&#39;s fully aware of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">doing that he&#39;s using that meta systemic</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.899" end="00:34:36.179" style="s2">capacity but he also has the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:38.580" style="s2">for paired ematic and and and cross pair</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.179" end="00:34:41.340" style="s2">demanded thinking so he doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.580" end="00:34:43.619" style="s2">reflect on those things he tries to tie</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.340" end="00:34:47.340" style="s2">them together I mean he he&#39;ll say one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.619" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">the things for example that Piaget was</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.340" end="00:34:51.419" style="s2">trying to do was to integrate science</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:57.450" style="s2">and religion and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.419" end="00:35:01.619" style="s2">things that he very much wants to do and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.450" end="00:35:05.030" style="s2">so he does he is making use of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.619" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">capacities although he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.030" end="00:35:17.430" style="s2">transcended and included so he&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">capacities that will encompass the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.430" end="00:35:23.859" style="s2">limitations of having just that stage</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:26.950" style="s2">this is just that stage</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.859" end="00:35:29.650" style="s2">gets lost in radical Galit arianism and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.950" end="00:35:33.940" style="s2">relativism and all of that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.650" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">really good stage to only have access to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.940" end="00:35:41.140" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t he has access to paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:50.349" style="s2">attic and cross very dramatic stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.140" end="00:35:53.589" style="s2">terms of anger this the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.349" end="00:35:55.390" style="s2">at an integral stage doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.589" end="00:35:57.339" style="s2">first of all it doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.390" end="00:35:59.559" style="s2">have you can have no shadow elements you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.339" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">do you&#39;re just repressing elements from</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.559" end="00:36:09.220" style="s2">the integral stages and that certainly</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:11.799" style="s2">can happen and so and he no shadow</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.220" end="00:36:15.849" style="s2">material very well and he&#39;s made a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.799" end="00:36:19.329" style="s2">enormous amount of giving an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.849" end="00:36:23.470" style="s2">amount of studying to it particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.329" end="00:36:26.589" style="s2">the line of young I said he knows his</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.470" end="00:36:29.829" style="s2">own shadow and and and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.589" end="00:36:36.549" style="s2">perfectly aware that he still has some</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.829" end="00:36:43.720" style="s2">of it I think that his anger is one that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.549" end="00:36:46.029" style="s2">is in a sense a type of it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.720" end="00:36:49.980" style="s2">kind of existential anger it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.029" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">kind of anger that looks at something</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.980" end="00:36:56.619" style="s2">that just from the most number of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:37:01.509" style="s2">perspectives seems just patently wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.619" end="00:37:03.460" style="s2">is patently mistaken now again I you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.509" end="00:37:05.049" style="s2">know I think every discipline has some</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.460" end="00:37:07.619" style="s2">degree of truth because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.049" end="00:37:11.259" style="s2">any disciplines capable just being 100%</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.619" end="00:37:14.589" style="s2">wrong there&#39;d be no reason it would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.259" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">adopted if it was just nothing but wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.589" end="00:37:24.869" style="s2">every time he tried it you would give it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:27.369" style="s2">up but they can do things that are so</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.869" end="00:37:29.529" style="s2">dysfunctional and they can be so broken</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.369" end="00:37:31.589" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.529" end="00:37:35.619" style="s2">happened to leading-edge Green it is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.589" end="00:37:37.540" style="s2">fundamentally broken green and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.619" end="00:37:40.540" style="s2">for example in</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.540" end="00:37:43.780" style="s2">I did this book on Trump in a post truth</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.540" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">world and tried to indicate how that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.780" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">broken green was a large part of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">political movement that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">today and that&#39;s the problem with green</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:57.070" style="s2">it&#39;s not a healthy leading-edge and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:59.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a real real problem because it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.070" end="00:38:02.110" style="s2">leading-edge what&#39;s starting to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.950" end="00:38:05.560" style="s2">over that leading edge is second tier</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.110" end="00:38:08.740" style="s2">because again we have about 5% 6% there</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.560" end="00:38:11.260" style="s2">when it gets closer to 10% then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.740" end="00:38:12.730" style="s2">officially going to be a leading edge</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.260" end="00:38:13.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.730" end="00:38:19.090" style="s2">tipping point we&#39;re going to see that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.960" end="00:38:22.900" style="s2">happening so in terms of any number of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.090" end="00:38:25.330" style="s2">individuals in the dark web who again</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.900" end="00:38:30.820" style="s2">most of them I think are operating with</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.330" end="00:38:36.070" style="s2">integral cognitive capacities doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.820" end="00:38:40.090" style="s2">stop any of them from having very</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.070" end="00:38:42.310" style="s2">specific existential anger issues and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.090" end="00:38:48.700" style="s2">things that they see and think that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.310" end="00:38:54.850" style="s2">wrong I think that if you sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.700" end="00:38:58.060" style="s2">actually look at the items that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.850" end="00:39:00.220" style="s2">included in each particular stage and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.060" end="00:39:02.290" style="s2">see how those fundamental items are</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.220" end="00:39:04.450" style="s2">taken up and included in the next stage</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.290" end="00:39:07.690" style="s2">and then those are taken up and included</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.450" end="00:39:10.510" style="s2">in the next stage I think people could</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.690" end="00:39:13.510" style="s2">see how somebody like Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.510" end="00:39:16.270" style="s2">making use of those fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.510" end="00:39:17.950" style="s2">intrinsic factors of that stage but a</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.270" end="00:39:19.750" style="s2">lot of people say he doesn&#39;t try and</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.950" end="00:39:24.130" style="s2">send don&#39;t include green you think he</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.750" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">does I I think he does and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.130" end="00:39:35.880" style="s2">part of green that he doesn&#39;t like is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:39.970" style="s2">the extremists identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.880" end="00:39:41.730" style="s2">neo-marxist aspects and my point is</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.970" end="00:39:44.170" style="s2">simply that if you look at virtually any</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.730" end="00:39:46.630" style="s2">developmental model of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.170" end="00:39:49.840" style="s2">development you will see a stage of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.630" end="00:39:50.820" style="s2">development that&#39;s variously recalled</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.840" end="00:39:53.460" style="s2">dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.820" end="00:39:56.580" style="s2">or relativistic or multicultural or</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.460" end="00:39:59.340" style="s2">whatever it is and it&#39;s just introducing</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.580" end="00:40:01.260" style="s2">a new perspective that can then reflect</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.340" end="00:40:03.150" style="s2">on the previous perspective and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.260" end="00:40:04.380" style="s2">perspective can reflect on the previous</p>

<p begin="00:40:04.380" end="00:40:10.850" style="s2">and those are real capacities real</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.470" end="00:40:19.140" style="s2">characteristics and those are included</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.850" end="00:40:22.050" style="s2">in almost every dark web intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.140" end="00:40:25.470" style="s2">that we have but then you&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.050" end="00:40:29.160" style="s2">get angry with various aspects of any of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.470" end="00:40:32.570" style="s2">these things and that anger might be</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.770" end="00:41:10.740" style="s2">theorists come in and initially they</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.800" end="00:41:12.810" style="s2">were making interesting points but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.740" end="00:41:14.910" style="s2">they got caught in relativism that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.810" end="00:41:16.830" style="s2">started to generate into Neil ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.910" end="00:41:17.700" style="s2">narcissism and I just went off the deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.830" end="00:41:21.210" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.700" end="00:41:23.490" style="s2">and we completely lost almost any of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.210" end="00:41:28.770" style="s2">value at that point and that was very</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.490" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">disturbing and very angry making for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.770" end="00:41:34.620" style="s2">it really was in Fury you share his</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:40.050" style="s2">anger it&#39;s right you share his anger oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.620" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">yeah very much and I see some of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.050" end="00:41:45.480" style="s2">positive factors that led it to become</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:47.970" style="s2">the postmodern movement I mean the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.480" end="00:41:49.350" style="s2">point about there&#39;s traditionalism than</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.970" end="00:41:52.310" style="s2">there was modernism then there was</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.350" end="00:41:55.110" style="s2">post-modernism those are very real</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.310" end="00:41:57.120" style="s2">developmental unfoldings because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.110" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">the point that many people would say you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.120" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">and he differ is that he doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.110" style="s2">see any positive value in post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.110" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">I believe it&#39;s because there&#39;s been this</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:14.760" style="s2">enormous downplay in academia of looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:20.330" style="s2">at almost any of the real developmental</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.760" end="00:42:23.820" style="s2">sequences so again if you look at Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.330" end="00:42:26.310" style="s2">and-and-and or even even call young</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.820" end="00:42:30.630" style="s2">I mean Peterson says that the single</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.310" end="00:42:33.450" style="s2">best book on Jungian psychology is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.630" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">Eric von neumann&#39;s I think origin</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.450" end="00:42:37.590" style="s2">history consciousness and I happen to</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:39.990" style="s2">agree I was absolutely blown away by</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.590" end="00:42:42.210" style="s2">that book I read it several times and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.990" end="00:42:45.870" style="s2">even outlined it two or three times but</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.210" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">the whole point about his book was these</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.870" end="00:42:50.610" style="s2">stages that consciousness went through</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:52.710" style="s2">any stage had a different cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.610" end="00:42:55.080" style="s2">capacity he stays saw the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.710" end="00:42:56.910" style="s2">completely differently there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.080" end="00:43:00.210" style="s2">different world views at all of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.910" end="00:43:02.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s was so profoundly stunning</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.210" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">about the developmental of your point</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.490" end="00:43:07.350" style="s2">and it certainly too appears a but that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:11.010" style="s2">never to Smashing</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.350" end="00:43:12.690" style="s2">with Jordan I&#39;ve never heard him say oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.010" end="00:43:14.460" style="s2">and there&#39;s a worldview down here that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.690" end="00:43:15.240" style="s2">looks like this and in the world here</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.460" end="00:43:17.730" style="s2">looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.240" end="00:43:21.540" style="s2">Peter said his stages even though he</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.730" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">loves Pichet that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.540" end="00:43:26.670" style="s2">developmental studies just got shoved</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:30.870" style="s2">off the burner</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.670" end="00:43:33.750" style="s2">and so if he were actually looking for</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.870" end="00:43:37.740" style="s2">example at the ingredients that each of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.750" end="00:43:39.300" style="s2">these stages add I don&#39;t think he would</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.740" end="00:43:43.230" style="s2">disagree with any of those ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.300" end="00:43:45.900" style="s2">and given the fact that we have a fair</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.230" end="00:43:49.740" style="s2">amount of evidence that these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.900" end="00:43:52.170" style="s2">have to emerge in stages because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.740" end="00:43:55.020" style="s2">whole of one stage actually becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.170" end="00:43:57.270" style="s2">ingredient of the whole of the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.020" end="00:43:59.250" style="s2">stage so they are whole ons the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.270" end="00:44:00.690" style="s2">one stage is part of the next stage the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.250" end="00:44:03.000" style="s2">whole of that stage is part of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.690" end="00:44:05.850" style="s2">stage so you can&#39;t actually get to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.000" end="00:44:08.310" style="s2">higher stage without including that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.850" end="00:44:11.430" style="s2">lower stage and so what are we including</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.310" end="00:44:14.220" style="s2">well pre-operational you&#39;re including</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.430" end="00:44:17.420" style="s2">the passage for images and then concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.220" end="00:44:19.490" style="s2">symbols and in concepts and then rules</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.420" end="00:44:22.070" style="s2">and form operational matter rules and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.490" end="00:44:25.100" style="s2">then systemic paradigms and in Kraus</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.070" end="00:44:27.230" style="s2">paradigms and these are first person</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.100" end="00:44:29.030" style="s2">second person third person fourth person</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.230" end="00:44:31.160" style="s2">fifth person perspectives all of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.030" end="00:44:33.320" style="s2">are added I don&#39;t think he disagrees of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.160" end="00:44:36.530" style="s2">any of those and particularly if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.320" end="00:44:38.270" style="s2">actually looked at okay here&#39;s the skill</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.530" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">that you add here here&#39;s the skill you</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.270" end="00:44:42.170" style="s2">had here and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">and it received these broad broad stages</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.170" end="00:44:45.790" style="s2">or that kind of development I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:49.580" style="s2">think he&#39;d have any trouble with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.790" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">and if he did then I would just say well</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.580" end="00:44:53.750" style="s2">I agree with these hundred developmental</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.640" style="s2">maps that do you see evidence in those</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.750" end="00:44:59.000" style="s2">and I understand that you don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.640" end="00:45:01.670" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but much more common</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.000" end="00:45:04.610" style="s2">nowadays are things like the big five</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.670" end="00:45:06.230" style="s2">factor analysis I totally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.610" end="00:45:08.750" style="s2">that it&#39;s part of what we call types</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.230" end="00:45:11.270" style="s2">actual ingredient or the internal</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.750" end="00:45:12.770" style="s2">framework we totally include that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.270" end="00:45:14.690" style="s2">again types you something that say</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.770" end="00:45:17.330" style="s2">essentially the same no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.690" end="00:45:20.090" style="s2">stage you&#39;re at you can start to shift a</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.330" end="00:45:24.680" style="s2">little bit but basically they stay the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.090" end="00:45:26.660" style="s2">same that&#39;s what a type is and so and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.680" end="00:45:30.790" style="s2">also goes for example and if you even</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.660" end="00:45:33.710" style="s2">talk about types of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.790" end="00:45:37.220" style="s2">interaction or interest the traits those</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.710" end="00:45:40.310" style="s2">stay essentially similar as you grow and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.220" end="00:45:42.740" style="s2">develop so you can look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.310" end="00:45:44.540" style="s2">things that all these stages have in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.740" end="00:45:47.600" style="s2">common and that&#39;s fine they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.540" end="00:45:48.850" style="s2">they&#39;re there but so are the stages I</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.600" end="00:45:51.260" style="s2">mean that&#39;s sort of the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.850" end="00:45:53.480" style="s2">because you have these dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.260" end="00:45:56.080" style="s2">different world views about how things</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.480" end="00:45:58.760" style="s2">look and act and what they mean and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.080" end="00:46:02.330" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re real and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.760" end="00:46:05.420" style="s2">an enormous explanatory power so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.330" end="00:46:09.860" style="s2">one of the areas that that we include in</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.420" end="00:46:12.860" style="s2">these 567 aspects of an integral in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.860" end="00:46:15.410" style="s2">remodel and you you just mentioned male</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.860" end="00:46:17.390" style="s2">and female and that&#39;s that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.410" end="00:46:21.890" style="s2">that Peterson has been criticized for</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:24.050" style="s2">quite a lot he for equating the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.890" end="00:46:28.130" style="s2">masculine with order and the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.050" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">with chaos this is a theological point</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.130" end="00:46:31.250" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s a simplified theological</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:33.550" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.250" end="00:46:39.050" style="s2">what what do you make of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.550" end="00:46:46.040" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s not my favorite aspect</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.050" end="00:46:48.829" style="s2">of what he does I can agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.040" end="00:46:50.540" style="s2">importance of order and chaos and even</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.829" end="00:46:55.099" style="s2">to some extent the way he connects it</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.540" end="00:46:56.420" style="s2">with left and right brain hemisphere and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.099" end="00:47:00.619" style="s2">that these are two of the very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.420" end="00:47:09.170" style="s2">fundamental dualisms that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.619" end="00:47:13.430" style="s2">manifested world is made of but but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.170" end="00:47:15.829" style="s2">direct connection of and he doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.430" end="00:47:16.550" style="s2">identify he doesn&#39;t say the female is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.829" end="00:47:19.880" style="s2">chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.550" end="00:47:25.300" style="s2">male disorder he says female is symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.880" end="00:47:29.630" style="s2">of it doesn&#39;t make it much better though</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.300" end="00:47:32.829" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t find that a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.630" end="00:47:37.579" style="s2">terribly compelling piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.829" end="00:47:40.970" style="s2">and and I find that it does that there</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.579" end="00:47:43.670" style="s2">are other ways to if you&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.970" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">to describe just general statistical</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.670" end="00:47:49.550" style="s2">differences between men and women that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.319" style="s2">one of them is symbolic of chaos and one</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.550" end="00:47:53.349" style="s2">of them is symbolic of order it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.319" end="00:47:59.329" style="s2">one of the ones that we find very useful</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.349" end="00:48:02.690" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think a whole lot of either</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.329" end="00:48:03.770" style="s2">men or women directly connect with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.690" end="00:48:08.470" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they find that very</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.770" end="00:48:13.130" style="s2">meaningful he also of course will</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.470" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">identify in general and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.130" end="00:48:17.540" style="s2">one of the problems not many people</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:22.369" style="s2">understand statistics and so if you say</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.540" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">60 percent of the most aggressive people</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.369" end="00:48:27.800" style="s2">are men and 40 percent are women people</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:30.859" style="s2">will think you&#39;re saying you know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.800" end="00:48:33.500" style="s2">it&#39;s just either/or and that&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.859" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">of the problems is that people that</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:41.060" style="s2">things are really misinterpreting what</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.089" end="00:48:43.220" style="s2">he&#39;s saying anyway I wanted to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.060" end="00:48:45.430" style="s2">something I&#39;ve heard David data say</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.220" end="00:48:48.529" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.430" end="00:48:50.839" style="s2">theologically you can identify the</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.309" end="00:49:07.900" style="s2">help expand this perspective well at</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.980" end="00:49:12.430" style="s2">this point what you are getting into is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.900" end="00:49:14.390" style="s2">a lot of different types of systems that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.430" end="00:49:16.430" style="s2">you know the fact that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.390" end="00:49:21.980" style="s2">have been on this planet for you know a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.430" end="00:49:25.039" style="s2">couple million years there have been at</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.980" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">least certain types of differences that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.039" end="00:49:31.999" style="s2">we&#39;ve noticed nothing else women give</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:35.749" style="s2">birth and lactate men on average have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.999" end="00:49:41.089" style="s2">slightly greater upper body strength so</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.749" end="00:49:44.440" style="s2">you can take a really brilliant feminist</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.089" end="00:49:49.970" style="s2">systems theorists like Janet chef is and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.440" end="00:49:51.910" style="s2">she&#39;ll say that what we have to do in</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.910" end="00:49:56.989" style="s2">the different roles that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.440" end="00:49:59.499" style="s2">have had is that we do have to start</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.989" end="00:50:03.619" style="s2">with at least a few biological</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.499" end="00:50:07.239" style="s2">universals and then look at how those</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.619" end="00:50:11.859" style="s2">play themselves out in different</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.239" end="00:50:14.509" style="s2">techno-economic modes for example and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.859" end="00:50:16.489" style="s2">that&#39;s an important type of addition</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.509" end="00:50:18.619" style="s2">it&#39;s part of what we call showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.489" end="00:50:21.579" style="s2">integral because we&#39;re looking at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.619" end="00:50:24.200" style="s2">four quadrants and the techno-economic</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.579" end="00:50:26.210" style="s2">mode is the lower right quadrant if</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.529" end="00:50:35.569" style="s2">the stages that are often used there for</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:37.489" style="s2">example are Gerhard Lenski who came up</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.569" end="00:50:40.269" style="s2">with the stages of foraging or hunting</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.489" end="00:50:44.150" style="s2">and gathering and then horticultural</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.269" end="00:50:46.789" style="s2">agrarian industrial and informational</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.150" end="00:50:49.309" style="s2">and janice athis took just those two</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.789" end="00:50:52.279" style="s2">biological differences ensured how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.309" end="00:50:54.380" style="s2">produce dramatically different roles for</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.279" end="00:50:56.300" style="s2">men and women at these different</p>

<p begin="00:50:56.300" end="00:50:59.780" style="s2">one of the reasons you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.830" end="00:51:02.780" style="s2">quadrants into account when you make</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.780" end="00:51:05.750" style="s2">these kinds of statements so even given</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.780" end="00:51:08.830" style="s2">those differences that are pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.750" end="00:51:12.080" style="s2">to deny at least in terms of biological</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.830" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">where we say upper right exterior of an</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.080" end="00:51:20.270" style="s2">individual viewpoint and foraging</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:23.120" style="s2">sexuals were just barely being</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.270" end="00:51:25.190" style="s2">differentiated anyway but the men tended</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.120" end="00:51:26.780" style="s2">to do those items that required upper</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.190" end="00:51:30.380" style="s2">body strength so they tended to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.780" end="00:51:33.620" style="s2">hunting and would tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.380" end="00:51:35.510" style="s2">warriors and then women tended to give</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.620" end="00:51:38.570" style="s2">birth and lactate and they just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.510" end="00:51:41.120" style="s2">played played that out when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.570" end="00:51:44.660" style="s2">horticultural you start to see a real</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.120" end="00:51:46.970" style="s2">shift where the cultural is the first</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.660" end="00:51:49.550" style="s2">form of farming and it&#39;s defined as</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.970" end="00:51:52.460" style="s2">farming that just uses a simple digging</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.550" end="00:51:56.810" style="s2">stick or hoe and the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.460" end="00:51:59.090" style="s2">about that is a pregnant woman can do</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.810" end="00:52:03.020" style="s2">that kind of farming without any real</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.090" end="00:52:07.010" style="s2">harm to her and chef has estimates that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.020" end="00:52:08.750" style="s2">in horticultural societies about 80% of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.010" end="00:52:12.890" style="s2">the fruit stuff were produced by women</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.750" end="00:52:16.340" style="s2">and so they clearly are having an</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.890" end="00:52:19.270" style="s2">enormous impact in the public productive</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.340" end="00:52:22.280" style="s2">sphere they&#39;re not just in the private</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.270" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">reproductive sphere and as a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.280" end="00:52:27.620" style="s2">fact in horticultural societies one</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:31.160" style="s2">study showed that approximately one</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.620" end="00:52:35.030" style="s2">third of horticultural societies had</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.160" end="00:52:37.460" style="s2">female only deities and these are all</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.030" end="00:52:40.550" style="s2">the great mothers societies and when</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.460" end="00:52:43.010" style="s2">these matriarchy societies were first</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.550" end="00:52:45.140" style="s2">discovered under the patio erekle</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.010" end="00:52:47.960" style="s2">society here&#39;s a massive discovery is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.140" end="00:52:49.640" style="s2">like wow and of course the feminists</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.960" end="00:52:51.530" style="s2">jumped all over is like you know women</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.640" end="00:52:54.470" style="s2">were first and then men took it away and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.530" end="00:52:57.070" style="s2">all adapt it was a huge discovery and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.470" end="00:53:00.530" style="s2">was discovering just this horticultural</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.070" end="00:53:03.710" style="s2">base and the way that took differences</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.530" end="00:53:06.140" style="s2">in human biology but still played them</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.710" end="00:53:08.330" style="s2">out very differently in terms of roles</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.140" end="00:53:09.480" style="s2">men were still kind of trying to go off</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.330" end="00:53:12.119" style="s2">into hunting and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.480" end="00:53:14.070" style="s2">but women were producing 80% of the food</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.119" end="00:53:17.150" style="s2">because that was coming from farming and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.070" end="00:53:19.589" style="s2">so they had a role in the public</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.150" end="00:53:22.410" style="s2">productive sphere and again about a</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.589" end="00:53:24.780" style="s2">third of those of those deities are</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.410" end="00:53:26.550" style="s2">female only and that&#39;s almost the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.780" end="00:53:29.040" style="s2">place you find that whenever you find a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.550" end="00:53:33.570" style="s2">great mother society it tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.040" end="00:53:36.300" style="s2">quite a cultural well then agrarian came</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.570" end="00:53:40.290" style="s2">into being that was farming done with an</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.300" end="00:53:42.599" style="s2">extremely heavy animal-drawn plow now</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:44.880" style="s2">greatest chef is women that did that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.599" end="00:53:47.550" style="s2">suffered an extremely high rate of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.880" end="00:53:51.900" style="s2">miscarriage and it was to their</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.550" end="00:53:54.210" style="s2">Darwinian advantage not to do that plus</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.900" end="00:53:58.380" style="s2">the just the heaviness of the damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.210" end="00:54:01.170" style="s2">tended to select for men in their upper</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.380" end="00:54:04.020" style="s2">body strength and so there was a big</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.170" end="00:54:08.520" style="s2">change and one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.020" end="00:54:10.500" style="s2">find there were other causes but looking</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.520" end="00:54:17.790" style="s2">at this omelet this is an almost Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.500" end="00:54:22.020" style="s2">orientation but the deities and agrarian</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.790" end="00:54:23.700" style="s2">cultures are oat 95% are male only and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.020" end="00:54:28.770" style="s2">if you want to start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.700" end="00:54:31.560" style="s2">something like a patriarchy that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.770" end="00:54:35.270" style="s2">you could really start to point at that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.560" end="00:54:38.430" style="s2">and say that&#39;s really patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.270" end="00:54:41.130" style="s2">Chavez&#39;s point is that but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.430" end="00:54:45.150" style="s2">just say it&#39;s oppression women were</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.130" end="00:54:48.230" style="s2">choosing not to do that and there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.150" end="00:54:51.210" style="s2">actually some studies of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.230" end="00:54:53.790" style="s2">patriarchal cultures history quality of</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.210" end="00:54:57.810" style="s2">life was much less for men than it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.790" end="00:55:00.480" style="s2">for women nevertheless women did tend to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.810" end="00:55:03.060" style="s2">then be in the private reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:06.030" style="s2">sphere men in the public productive</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.060" end="00:55:08.359" style="s2">sphere and that tended to start to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.030" end="00:55:11.490" style="s2">that kind of patriarchal orientation</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.359" end="00:55:13.410" style="s2">again you had to be very careful about</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.490" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">saying that was just men oppressing</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.410" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">women that&#39;s something that really</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:22.760" style="s2">drives Peterson crazy and I share some</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:25.580" style="s2">of that because</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.760" end="00:55:27.910" style="s2">takes away the agency of women and and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.580" end="00:55:30.770" style="s2">found that one of the most disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.910" end="00:55:33.820" style="s2">factors of the feminists theories that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.770" end="00:55:36.680" style="s2">tried to do that and try to blame all</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.820" end="00:55:38.780" style="s2">female conditions to oppression because</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.680" end="00:55:40.970" style="s2">it takes away their agency as if they</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.780" end="00:55:43.820" style="s2">actually had nothing to say or do about</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.970" end="00:55:45.980" style="s2">these societies but as they really were</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.820" end="00:55:50.119" style="s2">contributing in at least some important</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.980" end="00:55:51.710" style="s2">ways to how these were done I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.119" end="00:55:54.200" style="s2">what women</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.710" end="00:55:56.840" style="s2">there&#39;s feminists know that think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.200" end="00:55:59.210" style="s2">women were just acquiesce like sheep to</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.840" end="00:56:01.100" style="s2">everything that the man did to control</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.210" end="00:56:02.630" style="s2">them but these aren&#39;t the women I know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.100" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">died there I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.630" end="00:56:09.109" style="s2">finding these women but apparently that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:13.640" style="s2">happened then when you start to get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.109" end="00:56:17.930" style="s2">industrial cultures now you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.640" end="00:56:21.590" style="s2">a real shift because now machines are</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.930" end="00:56:24.980" style="s2">doing the work on nature that human</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.590" end="00:56:27.800" style="s2">bodies used to have to do and that takes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.980" end="00:56:30.080" style="s2">that pressure out so now there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.800" end="00:56:33.140" style="s2">longer as strong a selection for male</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.080" end="00:56:36.380" style="s2">body upper strength and female birth and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.140" end="00:56:41.330" style="s2">lactation and so here we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.380" end="00:56:43.130" style="s2">again universal modes of morality we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.330" end="00:56:45.800" style="s2">start to see the rise of the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.130" end="00:56:50.590" style="s2">movement we start to see the freeing of</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.800" end="00:56:54.590" style="s2">slaves and abolition and all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.590" end="00:56:57.410" style="s2">going against the traditional roles that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.590" end="00:57:00.109" style="s2">were laid down during agrarian which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.410" end="00:57:02.390" style="s2">men do all the public making decisions</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.109" end="00:57:05.300" style="s2">women&#39;s stay home and run the household</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.390" end="00:57:07.520" style="s2">in the family and those were rules that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.300" end="00:57:09.650" style="s2">both of them were stuck with it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.520" end="00:57:12.740" style="s2">like one of those was a whole lot of fun</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.650" end="00:57:15.230" style="s2">and the other was miserable I mean men</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.740" end="00:57:18.770" style="s2">died a year sooner they had to fight in</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.230" end="00:57:24.500" style="s2">war that virtually all of the death</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.770" end="00:57:28.460" style="s2">inducing jobs they had the state could</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.500" end="00:57:30.980" style="s2">force them to give their lives weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.460" end="00:57:34.760" style="s2">feral call them the disposable sexes</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.980" end="00:57:36.140" style="s2">I mean just it wasn&#39;t that the they just</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.760" end="00:57:38.480" style="s2">had it all bad</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.140" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t have it all good it</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.480" end="00:57:42.410" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like they arranged the society</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:43.870" style="s2">that gave them the best of everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.410" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">and women the worst of everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.870" end="00:57:50.750" style="s2">because if they did that they did a</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:53.630" style="s2">shitty job so I just think that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.750" end="00:57:54.770" style="s2">an idealistic version for men it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.630" end="00:57:58.390" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.770" end="00:58:01.820" style="s2">so then as we move into informational</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.390" end="00:58:03.950" style="s2">then there&#39;s even less drive for</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.820" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">physical force and what we&#39;re facing now</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.950" end="00:58:11.000" style="s2">is this possibility that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:13.730" style="s2">just have different interests and now</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.000" end="00:58:16.280" style="s2">they&#39;re more free to express them and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.730" end="00:58:18.680" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s point about that is that in</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.280" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">countries like Scandinavia where you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.680" end="00:58:23.390" style="s2">have the most freedom for men and women</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:26.120" style="s2">they actually show the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.390" end="00:58:28.100" style="s2">differences in terms of preferences and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.120" end="00:58:31.880" style="s2">so what&#39;s that all about</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.100" end="00:58:34.970" style="s2">well it&#39;s not just oppression it could</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.880" end="00:58:39.470" style="s2">be some but the oppression also remember</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.970" end="00:58:41.840" style="s2">is basically modernity gets blamed for</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.470" end="00:58:44.990" style="s2">all of these horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.840" end="00:58:47.240" style="s2">rules but modernity was halfway through</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.990" end="00:58:51.470" style="s2">the Cure they were starting to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.240" end="00:58:54.260" style="s2">of these agrarian roles which were very</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.470" end="00:58:56.060" style="s2">patriarchal again not necessarily just</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.260" end="00:58:57.860" style="s2">the oppression but just through the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.060" end="00:59:01.100" style="s2">differentiation of what the sessions did</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.860" end="00:59:04.280" style="s2">and the absolute brutality of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.100" end="00:59:08.390" style="s2">what we had to do just to stay alive and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.280" end="00:59:09.740" style="s2">that didn&#39;t include men having councils</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.390" end="00:59:10.580" style="s2">all the time trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.740" end="00:59:12.830" style="s2">oppress women</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.580" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">it was mostly men and women thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.830" end="00:59:19.400" style="s2">together what are we going to do to</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:22.520" style="s2">manage to stay alive and yes there was</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.400" end="00:59:24.740" style="s2">oppression and that was during an</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.520" end="00:59:28.670" style="s2">ethnocentric era so of course there was</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.740" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">racism and slavery and one tribe against</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.670" end="00:59:37.010" style="s2">other tribes and all of that those roles</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:39.800" style="s2">are what the modern rational industrial</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.010" end="00:59:42.050" style="s2">societies started to overcome and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.800" end="00:59:44.060" style="s2">they become even more so in information</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.050" end="00:59:48.070" style="s2">and what we&#39;re trying to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.060" end="00:59:49.700" style="s2">because we have this leading-edge green</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.070" end="00:59:53.600" style="s2">which is bro</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.700" end="00:59:56.390" style="s2">again mostly not allowing us to even</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.600" end="00:59:59.360" style="s2">discuss these issues because everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.390" end="01:00:01.700" style="s2">simply has to be equal outcome and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.360" end="01:00:04.610" style="s2">it&#39;s not there&#39;s discrimination there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.700" end="01:00:07.760" style="s2">sexism there&#39;s racism there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.610" end="01:00:09.380" style="s2">going on and again the difficulties that</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.760" end="01:00:13.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not that those aren&#39;t occurring</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.380" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just those are only occurring there</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.910" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">are other reasons that it&#39;s occurring</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">and those aren&#39;t necessarily bad those</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:23.300" style="s2">have to be allowed or else are going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:24.560" style="s2">start erasing those as well and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.300" end="01:00:26.330" style="s2">going to end up doing what you did with</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.560" end="01:00:27.920" style="s2">hierarchies you&#39;re going to try to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.330" end="01:00:29.270" style="s2">rid of all the Dominator hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.920" end="01:00:31.250" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get rid of all the growth</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.270" end="01:00:33.980" style="s2">hierarchies and then you can have to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.250" end="01:00:36.800" style="s2">no way to even grow to the values that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.980" end="01:00:39.830" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get established you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.800" end="01:00:42.380" style="s2">lost the path to it so all you can do is</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.830" end="01:00:43.760" style="s2">protest and yell and scream and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.380" end="01:00:46.850" style="s2">do any good at all</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.760" end="01:00:48.530" style="s2">so there&#39;s a theological point like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.850" end="01:00:51.050" style="s2">lot of people are critical of Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.530" end="01:00:53.120" style="s2">Peterson because on some level he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.050" end="01:00:56.060" style="s2">doing a really important role of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.120" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">restoring the role of the father in some</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.060" end="01:01:00.470" style="s2">sense but there is a sense that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:03.250" style="s2">looking back to like he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.470" end="01:01:07.100" style="s2">restore Christian values and very</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.250" end="01:01:09.020" style="s2">masculine religious values could it be</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.100" end="01:01:11.570" style="s2">that actually we&#39;re seeing a theological</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.020" end="01:01:14.120" style="s2">shift so the kind of theology that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.570" end="01:01:16.370" style="s2">moving into is more of a balance between</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.120" end="01:01:18.740" style="s2">masculine and feminine because as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.370" end="01:01:21.140" style="s2">said that the role of of men and women</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.740" end="01:01:23.750" style="s2">is changing so actually what we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.140" end="01:01:26.090" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily need a restoration of</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.750" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">the sort of God the Father maybe what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.090" end="01:01:32.950" style="s2">need is a different theological</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:37.550" style="s2">synthesis well I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.950" end="01:01:40.190" style="s2">the difficulties that come and they they</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.550" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">come in part because we leave out that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.190" end="01:01:45.830" style="s2">developmental component so we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:48.620" style="s2">talking a bit earlier about just the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.830" end="01:01:51.590" style="s2">sort of Janet chef has few which which I</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.620" end="01:01:54.920" style="s2">find there there&#39;s some genuine truth to</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.590" end="01:01:57.550" style="s2">that as part of a overall integral</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.920" end="01:01:57.550" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.880" end="01:02:04.970" style="s2">but you can see how there were shifts</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.310" end="01:02:08.780" style="s2">from more mature focal societies to more</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.970" end="01:02:11.660" style="s2">Patra focal societies and then two</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.780" end="01:02:16.610" style="s2">societies start to try to overcome those</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.660" end="01:02:18.140" style="s2">and those new stages of development</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.610" end="01:02:20.810" style="s2">certainly industrialization and</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.140" end="01:02:24.070" style="s2">information to the extent that those had</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.810" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">in effect on our culture and they did</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.070" end="01:02:28.610" style="s2">they&#39;re not something you found in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:31.880" style="s2">Bible there&#39;s not something you found in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.610" end="01:02:33.770" style="s2">early civilization now Jordan my sake</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.880" end="01:02:36.890" style="s2">yeah but we had the seeds for all that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.770" end="01:02:39.170" style="s2">there and go right but notice that still</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.890" end="01:02:41.960" style="s2">took a while to unfold and many of those</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.170" end="01:02:45.530" style="s2">early stages didn&#39;t have that and many</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.960" end="01:02:47.870" style="s2">of these existential or even</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.530" end="01:02:51.890" style="s2">transcendental important Givens that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.870" end="01:02:55.970" style="s2">were being embedded in religion those</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.890" end="01:03:00.430" style="s2">also tended to unfold even though we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.970" end="01:03:04.490" style="s2">find in the judeo-christian tradition</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.430" end="01:03:08.030" style="s2">this tendency that would eventually lead</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.490" end="01:03:12.380" style="s2">to individual rights even if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.030" end="01:03:15.890" style="s2">that often expressed in a full extent in</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.380" end="01:03:18.860" style="s2">the original orientation and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.890" end="01:03:22.630" style="s2">particularly since most of the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.860" end="01:03:25.420" style="s2">great religions did arise during</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.630" end="01:03:30.730" style="s2">appearance like the great axial period</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.420" end="01:03:34.040" style="s2">roughly a millennia or so BCE</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.730" end="01:03:38.390" style="s2">those really were the error GE Epps&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.040" end="01:03:46.760" style="s2">error of just the modern mythic era and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.390" end="01:03:49.490" style="s2">and for a lot of the religions created</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.760" end="01:03:53.000" style="s2">at that time there were again these two</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.490" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">different aspects there was a very small</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.000" end="01:03:58.390" style="s2">number they were involved in waking up</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:04:01.670" style="s2">actually having this transformative</p>

<p begin="01:04:09.970" end="01:04:14.590" style="s2">history of my people or something like</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.010" end="01:04:18.790" style="s2">that when it says Moses parted the Red</p>

<p begin="01:04:21.400" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">the Red Sea they didn&#39;t have some deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.980" end="01:04:30.730" style="s2">symbolic meaning to that it didn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:32.920" style="s2">oh the Israelites had to overcome a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.730" end="01:04:36.340" style="s2">of problems and we look to our leader</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.920" end="01:04:39.820" style="s2">Moses and he could he could help do away</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.340" end="01:04:42.040" style="s2">with with blockades like moving a Red</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.820" end="01:04:44.440" style="s2">Sea and that was all symbolic and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.040" end="01:04:46.869" style="s2">we moved out and found our own promise</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.440" end="01:04:49.810" style="s2">that&#39;s not what the person meant when</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.869" end="01:04:52.510" style="s2">they wrote Moses parted the Red Sea they</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.810" end="01:04:54.880" style="s2">meant this guy named Moses stood next to</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.510" end="01:04:57.490" style="s2">the Red Sea and he went back and the sea</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.880" end="01:05:00.310" style="s2">parted and they walked across that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.490" end="01:05:03.430" style="s2">what he meant and so again when James</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.310" end="01:05:07.540" style="s2">Fowler was actually measuring these</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.430" end="01:05:10.930" style="s2">developmental stages of religious belief</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.540" end="01:05:13.420" style="s2">systems and again like most about mental</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.930" end="01:05:15.910" style="s2">models he found six to eight major</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.420" end="01:05:19.050" style="s2">stages of development and they were</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.910" end="01:05:22.599" style="s2">versions of archaic to magic to mythic</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.050" end="01:05:23.859" style="s2">rational pluralistic and integral most</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.599" end="01:05:26.710" style="s2">of these weren&#39;t he actually called</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.859" end="01:05:27.820" style="s2">mythic literal because the myths were</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.710" end="01:05:33.040" style="s2">meant literally</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.820" end="01:05:36.760" style="s2">and so you&#39;ll notice when Peterson tells</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.040" end="01:05:39.339" style="s2">us the meaning of Genesis or the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.760" end="01:05:42.430" style="s2">of exes or those kinds of things he</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.339" end="01:05:45.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t agree with the literal meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.430" end="01:05:48.790" style="s2">and the literal meaning is what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.730" end="01:05:52.180" style="s2">original writers meant that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.790" end="01:05:56.230" style="s2">were saying but he&#39;s trying to read</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.180" end="01:05:58.330" style="s2">something deeper into that and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.230" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">might be there and in to some extent of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.330" end="01:06:03.970" style="s2">course it is simply because societies</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:06.359" style="s2">have not only their explicit conscious</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.970" end="01:06:09.150" style="s2">understandings for those sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.359" end="01:06:11.109" style="s2">infrastructure interactions and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.150" end="01:06:12.550" style="s2">mechanical systems that are occurring</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.109" end="01:06:14.680" style="s2">that we know nothing about or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.550" end="01:06:19.390" style="s2">really understand so all that&#39;s fine and</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.680" end="01:06:23.710" style="s2">we do have this whole left hand first</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.390" end="01:06:25.420" style="s2">and second person implicit rules</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.710" end="01:06:28.240" style="s2">and patterns of behavior that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.420" end="01:06:31.450" style="s2">really not that much aware of so he it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:33.369" style="s2">okay for him looking for those but one</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.450" end="01:06:37.089" style="s2">of the reasons I hate he won&#39;t himself</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.369" end="01:06:39.670" style="s2">just say yeah I believe that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.089" end="01:06:42.460" style="s2">believe Moses really parted the Red Sea</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.670" end="01:06:45.819" style="s2">not literally so that&#39;s not what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.460" end="01:06:49.319" style="s2">talking about and and this is a little</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.819" end="01:06:52.510" style="s2">bit where the problem comes in because</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.319" end="01:06:55.450" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to do that and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.510" end="01:06:59.859" style="s2">going to look for these underlying rules</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.450" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">and patterns really best evidence is</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.859" end="01:07:07.510" style="s2">that those unfold those develop those</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:12.339" style="s2">have changed we don&#39;t look at human</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.510" end="01:07:14.650" style="s2">sacrifice the way we did 4,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.339" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">there are different implicit rules for</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.650" end="01:07:20.470" style="s2">that we did do that it archaic to magic</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:22.630" style="s2">periods but then we crew out of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.470" end="01:07:25.569" style="s2">and there are different grammars</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.630" end="01:07:28.900" style="s2">different rules at each of these stages</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.569" end="01:07:32.740" style="s2">and the same goes for how men and women</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.900" end="01:07:35.619" style="s2">have interacted even if we agree with</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.740" end="01:07:39.819" style="s2">let&#39;s say a big five statistical</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.619" end="01:07:42.760" style="s2">analysis that men have more</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.819" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">industriousness and women have more</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.760" end="01:07:47.609" style="s2">agreeableness and negative emotions say</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:50.319" style="s2">okay that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.609" end="01:07:53.650" style="s2">but just as we saw with you Janet chef</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.319" end="01:07:57.160" style="s2">is analysis of the male and female roles</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.650" end="01:08:00.520" style="s2">at different tech North anomic eras even</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.160" end="01:08:02.920" style="s2">though it&#39;s the same biology there can</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.520" end="01:08:05.890" style="s2">be these differences in terms of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.920" end="01:08:11.549" style="s2">masculine and what&#39;s feminine and so if</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.890" end="01:08:16.049" style="s2">we want to choose some of those things</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.549" end="01:08:18.699" style="s2">that have some sort of truth today and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.049" end="01:08:21.219" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to track them all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.699" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">way back you know to three thousand</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.219" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">years ago we have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">about how we do that and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">things that I think will help Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:39.429" style="s2">explanation of religion</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:43.299" style="s2">if he does look at these different</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.429" end="01:08:47.049" style="s2">stages of religion the actual beliefs as</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.299" end="01:08:48.819" style="s2">they unfolded and not simply sort of put</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.049" end="01:08:51.130" style="s2">them all together as a single narrative</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.819" end="01:08:54.730" style="s2">and then try to read the existential</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.130" end="01:08:58.960" style="s2">underlying rules for all of them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.730" end="01:09:01.870" style="s2">that that&#39;s a little bit dicey if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.960" end="01:09:05.080" style="s2">really are looking at different ways</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.870" end="01:09:07.449" style="s2">that human beings develop through their</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.080" end="01:09:09.900" style="s2">spiritual understandings and again I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.449" end="01:09:12.609" style="s2">just mention James Fowler very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.900" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">he was one of the pioneers that was</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.609" end="01:09:17.409" style="s2">looking at these different capacities</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:20.230" style="s2">that humans have in this case he looked</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.409" end="01:09:22.089" style="s2">at something that we recall spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.230" end="01:09:23.799" style="s2">intelligence so like cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.089" end="01:09:26.290" style="s2">intelligence emotional intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.799" end="01:09:28.330" style="s2">moral intelligence there&#39;s a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.290" end="01:09:31.449" style="s2">intelligence that&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.330" end="01:09:33.730" style="s2">direct spiritual experience direct</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.449" end="01:09:35.350" style="s2">spiritual experience that&#39;s waking up</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.730" end="01:09:37.420" style="s2">again we can talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.350" end="01:09:40.929" style="s2">that because Petersen is perfectly aware</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.420" end="01:09:44.730" style="s2">of waking up and he absolutely aware of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.929" end="01:09:47.909" style="s2">it but he doesn&#39;t really talk about that</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.730" end="01:09:50.770" style="s2">so he talks about more than growing up</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.909" end="01:09:52.900" style="s2">components and how that happened but he</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.770" end="01:09:55.659" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take a look at some of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.900" end="01:09:58.239" style="s2">different stages like capsules archaic</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.659" end="01:10:00.900" style="s2">magic mythic into rational with the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.239" end="01:10:04.440" style="s2">Western culture and then into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.900" end="01:10:10.360" style="s2">multicultural pluralistic post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.440" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">valor found that and he defined God the</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.360" end="01:10:17.860" style="s2">way Tillich did as concern as an</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:20.469" style="s2">ultimate concern so whatever your</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.860" end="01:10:22.929" style="s2">ultimate concern is if you make a list</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.469" end="01:10:24.610" style="s2">of the most important of the most</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.929" end="01:10:26.620" style="s2">important of the most important things</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.610" end="01:10:29.020" style="s2">in your life whatever the top of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.620" end="01:10:32.230" style="s2">list is is your ultimate important thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.020" end="01:10:34.449" style="s2">that&#39;s your God what ever it is it could</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.230" end="01:10:36.670" style="s2">be atheism and you&#39;re still using</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.449" end="01:10:38.280" style="s2">spiritual intelligence because whenever</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.670" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">you think about ultimate realities</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.280" end="01:10:43.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re engaged and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:46.719" style="s2">the intelligence that you activate when</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.780" end="01:10:49.179" style="s2">you think like that and the faller found</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.719" end="01:10:52.989" style="s2">that it really did go through these</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.179" end="01:10:57.820" style="s2">distinct identifiable stages and then we</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.989" end="01:11:00.909" style="s2">can combine that with people attend</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.820" end="01:11:03.219" style="s2">historical work like jean gebser you see</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.909" end="01:11:07.480" style="s2">some real similarities and in those</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.219" end="01:11:10.900" style="s2">things and they are profoundly different</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.480" end="01:11:16.780" style="s2">I mean you really can have a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.900" end="01:11:19.530" style="s2">worldview that&#39;s magic voodoo tends to</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.780" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">be an example of magic magic is the idea</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.530" end="01:11:28.690" style="s2">and it tends to occur and developmental</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:30.460" style="s2">sequences fairly early because the human</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.690" end="01:11:33.909" style="s2">organism is learning to differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.460" end="01:11:36.429" style="s2">itself from the environment and in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.909" end="01:11:39.190" style="s2">process was learning to do that it</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.429" end="01:11:41.770" style="s2">hasn&#39;t quite succeeded and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.190" end="01:11:44.590" style="s2">mental image of a thing isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.770" end="01:11:46.750" style="s2">real differentiated from the thing so it</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.590" end="01:11:48.659" style="s2">thinks that to manipulate its mental</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.750" end="01:11:52.540" style="s2">idea of the thing is to actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.659" end="01:11:55.750" style="s2">magically change the thing so if I make</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.540" end="01:11:58.570" style="s2">a doll that represents you and I stick a</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.750" end="01:12:01.719" style="s2">pin in the doll I&#39;ve actually hurt you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.570" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">that&#39;s magic and we all have magic we</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.719" end="01:12:05.230" style="s2">love superstition but that tends to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:07.630" style="s2">when the earliest stages of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.230" end="01:12:12.010" style="s2">development where the earliest stages of</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.630" end="01:12:15.760" style="s2">spiritual intelligence and so on and it</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.010" end="01:12:19.780" style="s2">is magic as it starts to move towards</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:22.140" style="s2">mythic you get a stage that Spile</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.780" end="01:12:24.820" style="s2">dynamics for example calls power gods</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.140" end="01:12:26.980" style="s2">because you realize there&#39;s still magic</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.820" end="01:12:32.230" style="s2">or you think there&#39;s still magic in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.980" end="01:12:34.210" style="s2">world but it&#39;s you don&#39;t have it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.230" end="01:12:36.580" style="s2">you keep trying it really doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.210" end="01:12:39.640" style="s2">so you sort of give up but others have</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.580" end="01:12:43.570" style="s2">it so mommy for example could change the</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.640" end="01:12:47.260" style="s2">yucky spinach into candy if she wanted</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.570" end="01:12:49.570" style="s2">because she&#39;s a power God and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.260" end="01:12:51.429" style="s2">want to be on the good side of your</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.570" end="01:12:52.659" style="s2">power God you have to know how to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.429" end="01:12:55.090" style="s2">nice to it you have to know what it</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.659" end="01:12:57.940" style="s2">wants to say and develop these whole</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.090" end="01:13:02.770" style="s2">rituals or types of prayers and so on</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.940" end="01:13:05.530" style="s2">and eventually that magic retreat</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.770" end="01:13:08.470" style="s2">Senta just supernatural beings series</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.530" end="01:13:10.540" style="s2">sir Apollo Yahweh God that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.470" end="01:13:12.880" style="s2">and then you get the magic stage and</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.540" end="01:13:15.130" style="s2">that occurs on up until you get the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.880" end="01:13:17.200" style="s2">emergence of rational which has the</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.130" end="01:13:20.620" style="s2">third-person perspective reflects on</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.200" end="01:13:22.390" style="s2">that goes those are really real if I</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.620" end="01:13:24.760" style="s2">want something I&#39;m gonna have to do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.390" end="01:13:29.560" style="s2">myself through scientific experiment and</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.760" end="01:13:33.460" style="s2">and research so so you&#39;re seeing those</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.560" end="01:13:41.340" style="s2">kinds of development occur in religion</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.460" end="01:13:44.530" style="s2">and and what Peterson does is he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.340" end="01:13:47.500" style="s2">himself profess belief in any of what</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.530" end="01:13:49.420" style="s2">those stages actually say and he said he</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.500" end="01:13:51.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really believe that Moses</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.420" end="01:13:54.220" style="s2">actually parted the Red Sea he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.790" end="01:13:58.030" style="s2">really believe that Lot&#39;s wife was</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.220" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">turned into a pillar of salt but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.030" end="01:14:01.660" style="s2">what the people that had that belief</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:03.850" style="s2">that&#39;s what they believed</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.660" end="01:14:06.880" style="s2">now how much they are also being</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.850" end="01:14:09.580" style="s2">influenced by these hidden factors that</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.880" end="01:14:12.280" style="s2">he sees what was really happening that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.580" end="01:14:14.680" style="s2">a little bit more open to debate I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.280" end="01:14:18.870" style="s2">they are there but I think you do you</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.680" end="01:14:21.300" style="s2">see shifts as development undergoes</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.870" end="01:14:24.910" style="s2">because they just aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.300" end="01:14:27.280" style="s2">fundamental rules at those different</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.910" end="01:14:31.390" style="s2">kinds of viewpoints and you had to take</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.280" end="01:14:35.890" style="s2">those into account and so that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.390" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">the concerns with that now his argument</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.890" end="01:14:42.640" style="s2">Sam Harris is Harris focus is exactly on</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:46.150" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying and that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.640" end="01:14:50.200" style="s2">says and that&#39;s wrong and so he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.150" end="01:14:53.110" style="s2">actually criticize Moses really parting</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.200" end="01:14:57.030" style="s2">the Red Sea and he&#39;ll say that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.110" end="01:15:01.540" style="s2">false we don&#39;t need it get rid of it and</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.030" end="01:15:06.250" style="s2">then Peterson is again and Sam is doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.540" end="01:15:08.860" style="s2">it because he he&#39;s not an eliminative</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.250" end="01:15:10.270" style="s2">materialism but he does still tend to</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.860" end="01:15:14.230" style="s2">kind of reduce everything to third</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.270" end="01:15:16.469" style="s2">person determined causality and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.230" end="01:15:20.989" style="s2">no room for freedom in</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.469" end="01:15:24.150" style="s2">and in that at all and so he&#39;ll he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.989" end="01:15:27.389" style="s2">take all of those actual literal</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.150" end="01:15:29.429" style="s2">statements of religion leading up to</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.389" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">science and you&#39;ll say all of that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.429" end="01:15:34.469" style="s2">just flat-out bloody wrong it has no</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:36.630" style="s2">business being there it was a stupid</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.469" end="01:15:38.550" style="s2">mistake we made from the beginning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.630" end="01:15:40.800" style="s2">still around we&#39;ve got to get rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.550" end="01:15:43.439" style="s2">nothing good and he&#39;s altering from that</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.800" end="01:15:46.079" style="s2">third-person deterministic scientific</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.439" end="01:15:47.010" style="s2">stance and Peterson is always going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.079" end="01:15:49.130" style="s2">know wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.010" end="01:15:51.030" style="s2">there are these interior left-hand</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.130" end="01:15:53.249" style="s2">subjective and inner subjective</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.030" end="01:15:55.829" style="s2">realities and yeah okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.249" end="01:15:59.639" style="s2">actually Moses parting the Red Sea but</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.829" end="01:16:01.829" style="s2">it is these really existential means</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.639" end="01:16:04.079" style="s2">that help us develop value systems in</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.829" end="01:16:06.900" style="s2">the first place including a value for</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.079" end="01:16:09.719" style="s2">third person science that you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.900" end="01:16:13.380" style="s2">get that out of midair that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.719" end="01:16:16.289" style="s2">this implicit belief system that you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.380" end="01:16:17.760" style="s2">see in these religions but this is where</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.289" end="01:16:20.820" style="s2">they really are at cross-purposes</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.760" end="01:16:24.030" style="s2">because they&#39;re not really arguing the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.820" end="01:16:26.659" style="s2">same thing at all and both of them are</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.030" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">leaving out these developmental stages</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.659" end="01:16:35.219" style="s2">so what Sam really doesn&#39;t like is magic</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:38.189" style="s2">and mythic viewers of ultimate concern</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.219" end="01:16:41.249" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t like them in Islam he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.189" end="01:16:46.199" style="s2">like them in Christianity he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.249" end="01:16:49.320" style="s2">like them wherever he sees them and at</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.199" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">the time that they existed it was in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.320" end="01:16:55.919" style="s2">sense the best we could do but today yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:59.360" style="s2">you can do better in terms of the types</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.919" end="01:17:03.479" style="s2">of truth that might be attempting</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.360" end="01:17:05.939" style="s2">attempting to be disclosed there you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.479" end="01:17:08.939" style="s2">do better in many cases using a type of</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.939" end="01:17:11.150" style="s2">scientific third-person approach but</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.939" end="01:17:13.800" style="s2">there still are all these interiors and</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.150" end="01:17:16.110" style="s2">they still have various rules and</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.800" end="01:17:18.840" style="s2">patterns to govern them and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.110" end="01:17:21.449" style="s2">get those just through an objective view</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.840" end="01:17:24.659" style="s2">of science and that&#39;s where Sam is</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.449" end="01:17:27.209" style="s2">always holding out the last thing I want</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.659" end="01:17:30.150" style="s2">to say just very quickly is that both of</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.209" end="01:17:33.900" style="s2">them are fully aware of waking</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.150" end="01:17:37.679" style="s2">up and neither of them include that in</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.900" end="01:17:42.210" style="s2">their argument and it&#39;s weird because</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.679" end="01:17:46.440" style="s2">the actual super core of a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.210" end="01:17:48.719" style="s2">system is the system of waking up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.440" end="01:17:50.909" style="s2">not developing a series of beliefs that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.719" end="01:17:52.830" style="s2">okay I believe Moses really did that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.909" end="01:17:55.290" style="s2">yes I believe Christ really was born</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.830" end="01:17:56.699" style="s2">from a biological version and if I agree</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.290" end="01:18:00.179" style="s2">to everything it says in the apostle</p>
