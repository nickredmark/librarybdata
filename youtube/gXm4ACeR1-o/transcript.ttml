<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">symptomology of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">where we look at various symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">expressions of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">um and one is a phenomena that other</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">people have been articulating called the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">virtual exodus</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">uh this is the fact that people are now</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">showing a preference for the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">world virtual games for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">uh like video games um</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">and uh and one of the things about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">ask yourself what is it that people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">finding in this virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">that they find so extremely lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">uh reality itself in actual reality um</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">and then one of the things i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">explore because you said something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">sort of piqued my interest</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">and i think it was i think was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">humorous on on your part</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">but you described um the science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">these literatures as escapists</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">but i&#39;m wondering if right i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">if if we could compare science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">to the virtual exodus because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">problem with the virtual exodus is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">largely maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">it seems to be associated with video</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">game addiction all kinds of other</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">deleterious effects</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">extended uh participation in social</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">media is very bad for mental health</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">etc etc and whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t see science fiction necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">these deleterious effects on people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if by comparison</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">we might be able to draw out a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">about um kind of a triangulation</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">approach uh compare these different</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">things and see what they might tell us</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">maybe a bit more about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">in the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">but also how science fiction may play a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">role in helping people</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">perhaps adaptively respond to it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s something we could explore</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">yeah absolutely i mean i i have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">kind of questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">prepared for you but i had the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">that if i ask the questions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">probably less interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">than just seeing what emerges from us</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">talking together</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">so right that idea of escapism</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">is kind of at the center of all my</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">questions though right</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">one way or another right because i see</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">this as</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">very much like a continuum of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">the the overall term that gets given to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">it is often nerd culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">or geek right yeah yeah these are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">things that like share this escapist</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">they&#39;re usually fantastica in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">in their their like the symbols that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">and giving out to the world and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">that people have this sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">can escape into them and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">like a world</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">yeah very much they can enter into uh so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge part of science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">so the focus of the course is on like</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">creating these stories</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">and and how do we do that um</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh usually talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">terms of world building</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">so the idea that using this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">language on the page we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">build a world that we can enter into</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">could be an alien world and this really</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">got picked up</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">by video games yes very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">and all the early games that i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">back to you know things like the hobbit</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">these text adventures and they were so</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">basic when you think about them but</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">there was this since</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">we were inside them somehow and and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">genre of role-playing games which are</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">are taking on sort of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">uh significance uh there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">scandinavian form that is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">interesting to me called jeep form</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">in which people are doing live role</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">and the dungeon master is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">director the dungeon master will come</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">and assign like roles to you and say</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">okay you&#39;re a husband and wife</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re now right uh you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">discovered that your wife has betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">and now act out the scene and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">give you things and say this is a gun</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">and you have to treat it as props and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">they&#39;ll suddenly cut and say okay now</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">switch roles</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">and they&#39;ll do all this stuff because</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">and notice how this goes the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">way of escape</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">which is why i brought it up they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">looking for a phenomena called bleed</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">what they want is they want the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">difference between what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">in the game and their life to bleed</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">so that the distinction between them</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">and the reason is that allows right it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">allows the game to be a place</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">where they can taste they can try on</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">different identities</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">and ways of looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">and then right get them into a form that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">is transferable back</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">to their everyday life and is in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">sense facilitary</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">for them solving problems that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">finding very difficult to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">that also lines up with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">by my friend and colleague igor grossman</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">another work showing if you give people</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">ask people about their problems and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell you their problem blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah blah and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">almost inevitably tell it from a first</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:58.640" style="s2">then you then you do this to them you</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">say redescribe that same problem from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.640" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">third person perspective or how your</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">friend john</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">sees that problem and then they describe</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">it from that alternative perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">and then they get insight on how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">solve the problem it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">solomon effect</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">and so this idea of going out and coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">back in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">which bleed is really trying uh to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">like deliberately create i find that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">very intriguing because that speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">you that speaks to me something more</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">like tolkien&#39;s recovery theory of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">rather than a notion of you know just</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">escape</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">and if i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll say one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">no no you carry on because</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">when when you&#39;re doing that move when</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">see when you&#39;re doing this move where</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">you&#39;re going out to another perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">in order to come back and correct this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">you&#39;re in uh and you know and tolkien</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">called that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">the recovery theory right and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">transformation of your seeing and being</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">in this world that strikes me as very</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">very similar</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">to a lot of the i&#39;m going to put these</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">in quotes because they&#39;re contentious</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">a lot of the religious and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">practices you see within wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:07.959" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">whereby people do some act of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.959" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">through some you know other world or</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">deeper dimension of this world</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">or and and that is really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">because that seems to be reliably</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:23.839" style="s2">correlated</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">i would i would argue at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.839" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">historically with people</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">being able to cultivate wisdom and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">i would argue based on the work that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">the primary job wisdom has two jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">they&#39;re interrelated they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">interdependent jobs</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">it&#39;s to help you comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">overcome self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">and to help in increase your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">and so this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">right this these kinds of uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">fantastica let&#39;s call them that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">use that as a neutral term maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">right as being right i&#39;m proposing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">there&#39;s the continuum</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">that you see so yeah there&#39;s a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">this way with</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">virtual games but there&#39;s a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">this way if you&#39;ll allow me a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">with very traditional uh religious and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">spiritual practices of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">whereby people get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">where they can overcome an egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">that ameliorates self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:24.959" style="s2">enhances the sense of connectedness they</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">have to something</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.959" end="00:13:28.780" style="s2">larger than themselves but also more</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">real than themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.780" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">so i said i would stop and give you a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">chance to disrupt there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">so recovery</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">uh and the sense of stepping out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">ourselves in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">the spectrum from like video games</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">yeah to true uh like spiritual religious</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">ecstatic experiences yes yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">yeah um like i thinking of uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it was a documentary about uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">live role-playing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">and the people who got into live</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">role-playing and the different</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">characters involved and what one was</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">like a young man</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">very very low self-esteem and he ended</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">up as the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">the general in the live role-playing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">and like two years later he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">uh hugely confident he had a family um</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">and he was running his own business and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">it was like the experiences within the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">role-playing game</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">that had produced this recovery for him</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">yeah well well think about the think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">about these largely</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">and this is the right word fictional</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">worlds we take for granted when you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">into therapy</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">you&#39;re stepping into a fictional world</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">in which you&#39;re gonna the therapist is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">take on your being your mother or your</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">or some even some aspect of your own</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">personality and you&#39;re going to interact</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">there&#39;s all this enacted symbolism that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">affords</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">these self-transcendence people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">seeking in therapy or think about my</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">domain education we just we just forget</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">how how how weird and fictional</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">education is you go into this room and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">you spin</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">well not right now but right but you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">spin all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">possible worlds and i and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">and the whole point of that is to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">people to induce to draw from them</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">a new way of seeing them the world a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">way of understanding themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">and a new way of seeing connections</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">between the world and themselves i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">they were originally called the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">arts they&#39;re supposed to liberate us</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">in some important fashion they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">aspirational projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">you know and and i don&#39;t and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">insulting either way but like the deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">overlap between</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">you know religious philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">and you know things like science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">and the person that really</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">i mean my favorite author as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">growing up was raj zelazny</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">because his work was exactly exploring</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">that connection right yeah i think of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">like what you know what i consider</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">his masterpiece lord of light lord of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">light is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">about what i&#39;m talking about here right</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">and the whole point about the book and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">the way it&#39;s structured</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">is i think at least this is my</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">interpretation of what zelazny was</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">he was trying to create bleed he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">trying like and it woke me up</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">i was locked in a fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">christian worldview i&#39;d been brought up</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:33.279" style="s2">and i read that book and it shattered</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">that for me</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.279" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">and not because he not like sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">you know some new atheists come in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">gave me all these are also</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">it was like boom i did that thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">talking about where</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">he took me out of this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">opened me to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">a world and i recovered this world from</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">it and i just realized</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:56.480" style="s2">i can be other than i&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">and i can see other than i&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:01.440" style="s2">and i experienced profound recovery i</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what and so that book has</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.440" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">always just been</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">i mean i think there are other books you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">might call you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">i mean it won the hugo award was</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.039" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">nominated for nebula so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">slightly amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">piece yeah i think and so i mean for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m not i&#39;m not claiming all</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">science fiction does this but what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">there&#39;s authors that i&#39;m attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">that are i think explicitly and directly</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">uh doing exactly what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">they&#39;re affording</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">this this kind of i don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">calls i don&#39;t want to call it suitable</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s this para religious phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">where people are doing something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">what they used to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">you know with christianity had the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">narrative of the passion</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">of the christ right and you identify</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">with jesus and that takes you out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">and so i i what&#39;s interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">is that that that profound potential and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if everything on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">continuum that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">satisfies certain hungers for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">but some of them do it in a maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">sort of junk food version and then some</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">of them might be moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">an adaptive version of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">so go ahead go ahead this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">that uh like</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">that fascinates me and worries me at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">um yeah so like uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">one of the the talks in the courses is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">about star wars</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">and like being like seven years old i</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">and seeing star wars on a vhs uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">cassette video machine at the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">and like i was so fascinated by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">movie that i we had to borrow the video</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">machine from the family who owned it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">so i could watch it like five times in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">row</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">um but the comparison i make is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.280" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">that was probably this about the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">time as i ate my first</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">like cheeseburger as well and i was</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">really hooked by the cheeseburger in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.640" style="s2">same way</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">and uh so like the history of star wars</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.640" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware like the heroes</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">journey that&#39;s embedded in there</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">and where that came from and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">like distilled from</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">all of our great religious myths</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">uh and then placed into star wars so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">could make the argument that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">this sacred story and it must have</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">intense meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">but i also worry that it might just be</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">like an addictive substance like uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">that has all the appearance of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t actually mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">and i can&#39;t find an answer to that for</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">myself well well</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">well let&#39;s try it together let&#39;s try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">work on it together right here</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">i mean not that not that i&#39;m proposing</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">that we&#39;ll be able to solve it and why</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">you know but like but d logos getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">into deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">dialogue um is is very important to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">so let&#39;s look let&#39;s look at what chris</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">and i argued about the video games like</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">what is it they&#39;re supplying and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">alluding to campbell and to young and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">star wars right but i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">uh a broader analysis that we can uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">bring in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">that incorporates those insights but</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">extends them from cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">so look what&#39;s in look what&#39;s in um</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">a video game so first of all there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">narrative order</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">there there&#39;s a story that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">participate in into which you make a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">diff</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">which you make a difference and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">story relates your current self to your</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">future self</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">in a clear way so there is right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">it&#39;s so there and so human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">they need places where they can play</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">with non-logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">persons are weird things we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">identical the way to you know a coin is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">identical through time by</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">maintaining all of its properties or</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">even the way two coins are identical to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">each other by sharing all their</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t have any of the properties i had</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">when i was seven years old i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">have an atom in my body</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">that i had when i was seven years old</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">right i didn&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">cognitive science when i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">seven-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">i i was a virgin and i&#39;m not a very like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">right so the identity it&#39;s not a logical</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">or a categorical identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">and narrative is a way of practicing</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">non-logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">so that we can right relate to our</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">future self so narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">is there what else is there in the video</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">world well</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">well there&#39;s rules that world makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">sense to me like it makes sense to me i</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">understand it&#39;s it&#39;s ordered structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">so i call that a normal normal logical</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">that means the the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">principles by which the world is made</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:32.080" style="s2">intelligible to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">and you understand them and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">a normative order you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">and this goes back to what i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">a few minutes ago you can self-transcend</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">you literally level up right you level</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">up and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">and as you level up you connect to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">better future self and you connect to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">more important</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">you know deeper versions of the game</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">bigger scope you&#39;re ultimately going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">meet the boss</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">all that kind of stuff right now this</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">those are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">three things that religions</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">traditionally provided for people</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">religious worldview</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">right they gave you like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">here&#39;s the story here&#39;s the story and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">here&#39;s how you belong to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">this is that they gave you a world view</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">that made sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">and then they told you they gave you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">and communities of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">whereby you could self-transcend</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">so the video games now why is that why</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">do we why well</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">think about what what what we really</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">want what are the things that contribute</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">to meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">okay self transcendence this is a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">thing people</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">matter this is called mattering people</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">need to believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">with good reason i would argue that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">are connected to something larger to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">than themselves that they matter to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">that has a value beyond their ego sent</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">to predict</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s very predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">having enhanced meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">right they need right they need things</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">to make so</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">sense they need a sense of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">and and then finally they need a sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">of something it&#39;s called purpose or</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">they need that narrative orientation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">so those three orders address</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">three of the most primary and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">life is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t have meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">that&#39;s predictive of suicide depression</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">anxiety so uh you know uh social</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">malfunction social media like</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">the opposite is the case and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">this is so coincidental for video games</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">because video games have a fourth</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">feature video games</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">are flow induction machines</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">right they put you into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">right really really reliably</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">mm-hmm and and the thing about the flow</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">state it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">really predictive also of enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">meaning in life i</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">if you would if i if you had to ask me</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">you get to ask damian one</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">question and from that determine</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">how much meaning in life he has this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">the question i would ask damian</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">how often do you enter the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">not as often as i want to yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a good answer that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">good answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">so thinking about this what why what</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">does flow what&#39;s flow all about</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:18.400" style="s2">well flow&#39;s all about that terrific</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">sense of being deeply connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.400" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">to the world of the world of having</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">ongoing insight</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">of getting a good not</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">not just theoretical but an an</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">enacted sense of being coupled to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">deeper patterns of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">really great what&#39;s called implicit</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">learning so it&#39;s this connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">and sense-making and insight that give</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">people a tremendous sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">right now all of those are going on in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">the video game</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:51.679" style="s2">and they&#39;re all maladaptive because they</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">don&#39;t they&#39;re not set up to transfer</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">back to the real world</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">so within it&#39;s it&#39;s this weird almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">ironic paradox within the video game</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">you&#39;re getting everything that you want</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">but you&#39;re getting it in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">that is not designed to transfer</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like the situation of bleed</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not like when people go to church</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">people go to church</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">and they go in to a huge sim simulation</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">a huge if you&#39;re this is not meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">insulting a huge video game</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">in which they&#39;re doing all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">but the idea is that&#39;s supposed to bleed</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s set up it&#39;s designed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">to transfer out and so the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">and sorry this is a long preamble but</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">i think this has allowed me to formulate</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">a question is because i&#39;ve seen work on</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">is you know is the jedi religion that</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">came out of star wars a real religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">right and and chris and i took this up</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">and some of the work we&#39;ve been doing is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">we want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s really odd about this because</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;ll you&#39;ll meet a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">people and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re from that demographic uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">category the nuns</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">n-o-n-e-s they have no are you religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">no no no and then they&#39;ll go to these</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">conventions and they&#39;re dressed up as</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">and they enact things and like wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">you&#39;re very religious you just don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">just don&#39;t recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">so the question i want to ask it&#39;s a and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">i hope this doesn&#39;t sound too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">how much bleed is there how much</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">transform how much</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">does this participation in the star wars</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">genuinely enhance their capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">wisdom in their lives is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:38.240" style="s2">transformative of their sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">their sense of world and does it afford</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">measurable</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">increase so for example if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">doing a lot of star wars stuff and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">transferred such</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">that they were getting into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">state more often in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">or they were more capable of stepping</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">back and looking at their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">transforming it that i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">i would say it&#39;s actually providing</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">something like recovery</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">sorry that was a long argument but i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">i wanted to answer your question well</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">no that&#39;s fantastic uh so what leaps out</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">of it for me is that well</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of like an allen watts idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:16.640" style="s2">about about catholicism that catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">started failing people when it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">translated into english</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">because at the point that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">understand it you could essentially make</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">what you wanted to and you could write</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">things in there</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">so i have an idea maybe that if the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">audience could work with</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">with almost anything if if they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">were wired up to take bleed from it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">they could i mean i think there&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">i think there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">hmm i i i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">there are like essential features that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">have to be in existence in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">in order for it to be one in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">people can exercise cognitive agency</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">experience insight solve their problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">and you could you can see this by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">kinds of ways in which you can modify</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">environments and people will have very</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">aversive uh reactions to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">so um like i wonder about that like</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">let me be clear um i i&#39;m a pluralist in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">and that i think there are multiple ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">of setting these up so</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">it will work and i i think i in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">would argue stronger i think it has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">be that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">uh because people are in different uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">historical</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">cultural and environmental contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">making sense of that is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:40.000" style="s2">variation but let me give you an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">of how i&#39;m thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;ll be helpful because this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">is a question that really concerns me as</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">because if there aren&#39;t universals i</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">can&#39;t study it as a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">right um because that&#39;s true that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what you have to have right</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">and there are universals about float so</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">flow&#39;s a good example of a universal</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:00.760" style="s2">all of those differences i&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">cultural linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.760" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">socioeconomic gender right</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">historical background occupation</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">uh personality right people when they</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">people in all of those situations can</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">and they describe it in detail with</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">using almost the exact same words</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">so there&#39;s some so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">universal which means there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">okay so let me try and use an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">so the the thing i study as a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">and because it really links personality</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">and consciousness together is a process</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:41.760" style="s2">i call relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s this amazing ability you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.760" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">have here&#39;s there&#39;s an overwhelming like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">like people don&#39;t realize it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">astronomic number</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">there&#39;s an overwhelming amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">information available to you at any</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">an overwhelming amount of information in</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">your long-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s an overwhelming number of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">ways you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:01.840" style="s2">put sequences of behaviors together and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">generate patterns of action</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">and yet and so you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">search all of those you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">search most of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">you do this really weird thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">sounds like a zen cohen</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">somehow you intelligently ignore most of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">that information</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">and zero in on the relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">not not</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">perfectly but really really well so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">you often do the appropriate thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">in a situation and you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">appropriate information from your</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">long-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">and you right and what&#39;s and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">this has a lot to do with that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">because here&#39;s the analogy i wanna one i</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">wanna make</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">think about the way in which evolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:47.039" style="s2">is a universal process</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">in which you have two things at work you</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:49.840" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">something that&#39;s generating variation</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.840" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">like the number the variation within a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">and then you have a selective process</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">that&#39;s cutting it down</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">limiting it natural selection right</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">competition for scarce resources and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">what you get you have is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a feedback loop reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">within it there&#39;s variation</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">and then there&#39;s selection and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">variation and selection and the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">loop is constantly revolving with change</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">well your brain is doing something</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">analogous to that all the time you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">a sensory motor loop</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">you&#39;re taking in information and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">you&#39;re generating behavior even moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">your eyes around</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">right and so there&#39;s this constant</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">sensory motor loop</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">and notice how your brain like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">pressure on you right now to vary</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a pressure to be distracted and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">think about other things and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">oh but there&#39;s also another</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">countervailing one no no focus</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">stay connected and you&#39;re going you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">doing this all the time and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">constantly evolving what&#39;s the relative</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">that&#39;s happening right here right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">and so you&#39;re constantly doing that now</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">if that analogy holds then i can go up</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">my the point i want to make evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:03.760" style="s2">a universal process but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">produce the same products</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.760" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">everything is evolving but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">mean a shark</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">and a baboon are any are the same animal</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">they&#39;re very very different creatures</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">and so i think the stories we generate</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">can have terrific variety to them</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">arbitrarily created</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">in the same way yep right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">because because we&#39;re always engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">right right we&#39;re always having to fit</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:40.640" style="s2">it can&#39;t be arbitrary but it can be vast</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">right that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">with a real pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">yeah so you know all of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">the really popular uh science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">stories they all have all fantastica</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.279" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">the these archetypal characters</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">and they just repeat again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">again across the stories</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">uh and you know one way that you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.840" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">interpret that perhaps slightly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">cynically is maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">like some copying maybe people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">seeking originality in the stories</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">or maybe there&#39;s something else here</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">which is like this evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">process of storytelling uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">throw up these archetypes again and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">again and again for people</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">yeah exactly i mean so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that jung is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">wrong and we might there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">predispositions biologically</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">but it also might be something very</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">analogous to convergent evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">like you look at the ixia thor which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">a reptile and you look at the dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">which is a mammal and they look</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">the same because they&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">environment and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same ecological niche and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">you get convergent evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">or you get you know different species</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">like radically different</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">you know converging on the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">different kinds of eyes but</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">eyes keep showing up right across many</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">different species</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">right so i think it&#39;s very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">that there will be these archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about them then</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">is they</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">they we should we should pay very</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">careful attention to them i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">dismissing</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">the possibility that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">laziness and formulaic thinking involved</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">but let&#39;s say that when that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">case there&#39;s the real possibility here</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">that you know these archetypal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">in story making</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">are not escapist because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">actually pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">universal affordances of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">recover the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">by being more deeply connected to it by</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">seeing real possibilities in who we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">and what we can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s like the the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">of fantasy or science fiction is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">somebody that we we could become exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">some some potential we could draw out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">yes yes but but but but</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">that to me strikes again it&#39;s on an</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">adaptive continuum with</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">what would it be like you know do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">sing a revival of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">i i&#39;m involved in that well stoicism is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">i mean sorry don&#39;t take this</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">this sounds overly simplistic and it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a very complex phenomenon there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">lots going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">but if you&#39;ll allow me a bit of a slogan</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">just for the purposes of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">slogan stoicism is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">religion of internalizing socrates</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">right learning to see and be the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">socrates would be in situations</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s a long practice and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">a lot of imaginative exercises</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">if you do things like the view from</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">above where you practice imaginatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">rising above the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">so alter your sense of what&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">and important you have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">practice redescribing things</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">there&#39;s all these fictional imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">practices you engage in</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">in order to internalize socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">or you know the christians who who you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">know who are internalizing christ</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">saint paul it&#39;s not i who live but</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">christ who lives within me</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">or the buddhists seeking to you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">realize the buddha nature within the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">like that&#39;s it&#39;s the same i&#39;m sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">i i see it as</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">like i say i see this on a continuum i</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">you know when i when i encounter certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">figures in</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">you know in what is what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">deep difference because many people</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">admit</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">that the picture we have of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">from plato and xenophon</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:39.520" style="s2">is probably a mixture of fiction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.520" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">historical accuracy right so is there</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">that much of a difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">between internalizing socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">internalizing gandalf</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">in order to become wiser right</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a lot more there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">more philosophy developed around</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">socrates there&#39;s a lot more traditions</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">there&#39;s stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">and of course christianity has built up</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">around and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">there isn&#39;t something analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">gamble but i don&#39;t see why there</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be right i don&#39;t see why there</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be um</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">and and uh so</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">i mean the it keep for me keeps coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">back again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">yes these stories don&#39;t give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">knowledge the way science and history</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">give us knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">because they&#39;re not trying to give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">knowledge they&#39;re not trying to give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to afford transformation</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">they&#39;re giving us wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">and if they are really giving us wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to think of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">them as addictive or escapist</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">at all so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">raises the question for</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">for a fan you know for someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">like living a lot of their life</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">um to to to assess like the value of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">what they&#39;re engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">and maybe what i&#39;m more interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">like the responsibility of a creator</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">right right right to tell these stories</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">you know maybe you&#39;re like a storyteller</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">in the video games industry and you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:16.839" style="s2">like some kind of intuition</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">that these things are important but</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">maladaptive how would we start to think</p>

<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">and so again</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">given i mean actuality is excellent</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">proof of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.240" style="s2">right the fact that you know uh people</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">are i know somebody who&#39;s specifically</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">trying to do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">and i i know people on the other end uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">where you know they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">trying to create practices that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">involve this kind of serious play</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">well i do know sorry that i gotta</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">retract that because i realized what i</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">was about to say was just false</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">um if we could make a priority</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">because there&#39;s no there&#39;s no technical</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">psychological reason why we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">make these things</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">be bleed worthy and be be</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">set up explicitly as partake in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">and then here&#39;s also bridging practices</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">here&#39;s how you play the game</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">and then here&#39;s the practices that help</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">bridge you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">between the game and the real world</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">here&#39;s an analogy i&#39;m a martial artist</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">you do you do the form but you also you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">know you do things like sparring and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">other things you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">yeah what how do you transfer it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">to a self-defense situation or more</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">importantly</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">like when you&#39;re doing something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">tai chi chuan you really read deeply the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">dao te</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">chen because that&#39;s the bridging manual</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s how do i take what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">when i&#39;m training in this very weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">ritual thing i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">and make it make it bleed into my life</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">in fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">that happened to me one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">profound experiences i had i was doing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">combination of tai chi chuan</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">the pasta and meta and i was doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:48.480" style="s2">graduate school and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">i&#39;m just trundling along because i was</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.480" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">really interested in cultivating wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">way back when</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">um and and i was pursuing it very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">and i wasn&#39;t really from first person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">perspective noticing that much</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">but i was trying to do exactly this i</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">was trying to get it</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">to be i was reading the lyric like i was</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">trying like i was</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">at least setting up the context of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">making it transferable</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">and people started coming to me and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">saying what&#39;s what are you what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">on with you</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">and at first i thought oh no because in</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">graduate school you&#39;re afraid you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">offending other people all the time</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">right and i said what what is it what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">it and they said</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">you&#39;re different you write differently</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">you talk differently</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">you argue differently you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">balanced you&#39;re more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">you&#39;re more responsive so what have</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">happened is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">this very weird thing i was doing in tai</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">chi chuan</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">was bleeding out into my life there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">reason why we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">set these things up right what if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">read a great science fiction story and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">put around it like how does this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">transfer</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">how does this transfer to your life not</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">just idea transfer</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">like is there analogous things you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">do in order to try</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">and transfer it into your life i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">talking with somebody right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">is becoming you know a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">nick winkelmann</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">he wrote a book called the language of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">coaching and he his</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s really really good he talks</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">about when he&#39;s trying to coach somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">finding the analogy for them that helps</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">right transform into it&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">you need to run and you&#39;re sprinting but</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing it right i need you to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">sprint as if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">were an airplane taking off you&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">or then and then at some point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">now running up a hill how would you move</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">your leg</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">and imagine yourself in that and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">imagine that and then they recover or at</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">re like draw out the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">supposed to move</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">and see and they could do that we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">domains in which we&#39;re practicing how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">bridge</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">how to bridge how to transfer and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">have histories of doing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.560" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">this is what the religious histories and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">the religious philosophies we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">about we have the resources</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">we could bring them to bear there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">reason why we couldn&#39;t build this around</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">like these stories right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.440" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">this makes me think of two things</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">uh one is like the it because i find</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">in the science fiction world there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">like a conflicted attitude to criticism</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">stories because they&#39;re things that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">love so like a critical attitude to them</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">it seems offensive to some people um but</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">there&#39;s also a love of doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">about the stories and drawing meaning</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">out to them and this seems like</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">like the basis of a bridging activity</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">the the critical</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">yeah i think i think that for me the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">so this this is something i do work on</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">about what kind of things actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">affords the bridging</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">so let me let me sorry give me five</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">minutes and this will sound</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">like a digression but it involves</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:02.400" style="s2">stories and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">allowed me to make a point yeah okay so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.400" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:07.839" style="s2">called the dunker radiation problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">a classic insight problem the person has</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">you know a tumor at the center of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">skull</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">uh if you try and open the skull you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">expose them to too much infection</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll die</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">right but you can beam an x-ray beam and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">it won&#39;t kill them</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">but it will kill all the intervening</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:23.920" style="s2">tissue when it kills the tumor</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">so what do you do by the way this is no</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.920" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">longer fiction we now do this with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">thing called the gamma knife</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">we lean in right okay um so it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">and so many people like well how do i</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">solve this and the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">what you do is you break it up into a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">lot of low intensity beams</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">that only intersect at with a at a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">lethal level of intensity where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">tumor is</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">right so instead of one beam of lethal</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">intensity</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">you have multiple beams of sub lethal</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">intensity</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">that right that intersect just at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">point and like i said</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">they now literally do this with a thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">called the gamma knife when they need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">take out a small</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen somebody cured of lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">tremors where they found a little patch</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">of the neurons that they needed to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">rid of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">and they did the gamma knife on them to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">get to kill them so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">okay so you get the problem that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">radiation problem yeah okay so now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">say i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna put people in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:19.280" style="s2">and what i&#39;m gonna do is i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">give them a story to read</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.280" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">the story goes like this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">general who wants to attack a fortress</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">and the and the fortress is like at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">are like four causeways right that lead</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">to the fortress</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">and if the general marches his army down</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">any one</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">one of these pathways there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">garrison in the fortress and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">they&#39;re like the 300 they will come out</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">and like fight to the death and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">right and and the general will be too</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.079" style="s2">long fighting the battle he&#39;ll go out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">supply</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">so what does he do well he breaks his</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">army up into four equal components</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:53.119" style="s2">and has them converge simultaneously on</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">the fortress</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">because as the garrison comes out to</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">meet any one of the four the other three</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">can attack the undefended fortress</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">and take it okay so you give people this</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">about attacking the fortress then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.920" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">give them some intervening tasks you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">they&#39;re doing something and then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">unexpectedly give them the dunker</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">radiation problem right</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">that then they read this story</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">and they get no facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">they&#39;re no better than people who did</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">not read the story that&#39;s solving the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">radiation problem and you say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">why not well here&#39;s the problem the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">at the level of the ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">propositions the two stories</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">are the same but that&#39;s not the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">transfer your brain is looking for</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">because think about the task the tasks</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">are very different</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">when i&#39;m when i&#39;m doing the generals my</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">task is to comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">an existing solution and story</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">but when i face the dunker radiation</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">problem i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">solve an unsolved problem which is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">very different task</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">so although propositionally the stories</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">are very similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:10.240" style="s2">procedurally they&#39;re very very different</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.119" style="s2">now there&#39;s a bunch of research showing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.240" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.119" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">if i make two things procedurally</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll get transfer i&#39;ll get powerful</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">transfer</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">and so these bridging practices they</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">can&#39;t be practices about just like</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">taking ideas from that world and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">transferring them they have to do they</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">have to be deeper</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">they have to be about like that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">keep saying ways of seeing and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">that what&#39;s right and that&#39;s what will</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">transfer</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s how it&#39;s how it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">really astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">how powerful um that that level</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">is in how much it affects transfer</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">the other thing that came out was uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">so so many of these stories are now like</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">these huge</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">uh corporate projects yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">like they they cost like hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">millions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">and uh like i went to see the avengers</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">movie in in</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">bali when it came out and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">island came to a halt</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">for it so everyone in the world is now</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">like watching the same stories</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">but then we also think i think everyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">sees the value in like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">independent creators small creators</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">and there&#39;s some level that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">actually engage with like</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">people who are making the stories</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">for us yeah that goes exactly to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">point i was making</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">mm-hmm right if all people are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">consuming</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">that&#39;s at the propositional level yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">but if they don&#39;t practice the creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">and the living within it and creating it</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">so other people could come to live</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">within it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">right then they&#39;re not going to get that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:51.680" style="s2">kind of transfer and bleed</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why live action role playing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.680" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">so important you&#39;re not just consuming</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">you&#39;re also producing it especially in</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">situations where there&#39;s a high degree</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">of improvisation required</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">like so people people have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">i mean i think what you said is is very</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">astute</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">people have to get into a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s it&#39;s it sounds hubristic but</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">like to do to create these worlds what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">it like to move</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">in them what&#39;s it like to critically</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">assess them because when you&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">and creating</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">you have to engage in self-correction if</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">all they&#39;re ever doing is consuming the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">finished product</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">and the idea they&#39;re like the people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">are just reading</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">the story of the fortress and they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">be able to solve the</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">across it but if they have if you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">them to generate a solution</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s analogous then when they come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">the then they solve it</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">then they solve it that&#39;s what i was</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">trying to point to but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">you put it better than i did right the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">idea is people have to have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:54.800" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">relationship they have to be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.800" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">of making it and appreciating it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">correcting it and refining it</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">if they&#39;re going to be afforded the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">transfer from the world of science</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:08.880" style="s2">fiction to their everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">well at least that&#39;s what i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.880" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what i would argue i i</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">and i absolutely see it happening so</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">the science fiction fan community and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">calls itself fandom</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">and that kind of puts everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">in a position of being a fan i guess but</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">when i look at that community</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">especially as it&#39;s formed around the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">internet it&#39;s become tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">creative it&#39;s like yes a vast creative</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">with all different kind of levels of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">engagement of how people are making</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">you know it might be participating in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">role-playing games</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">and then trying to write your own novel</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">that this is all a process it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">some creators and consumers there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">whole process</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">of uh bridging from the stories</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">so it wouldn&#39;t take that much of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">tweaking because</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">that i mean that&#39;s what i see i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t write fiction but i i write and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">of course i appreciate this in people</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">who are fiction writers</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">i mean what let&#39;s go back to lord of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">light so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">you could read that book is oh wow this</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">is just what&#39;s it like to be a god and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">you know the blurring between science</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">fiction and fantasy and blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">or you can think and and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">the lasne ends the book is he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">almost hits the reader over a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">head with a hammer and thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">point of this the point of this is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">transfer it to your life right he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">writing he</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:42.559" style="s2">at the end of the book so writers</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">when they&#39;re creating the world they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.559" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">not i at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">i would say good writers aren&#39;t creating</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">it to be this self-enclosed escape</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">they&#39;re creating it to to educate and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">mean that in a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">people for their lives</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">right and so if if the fans aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">i want to just make this cool story but</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:04.880" style="s2">if they tried to emulate</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">you know the procedures of the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.880" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">really good writers of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">i want to make a story that&#39;s right will</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">it will</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;ll be like it&#39;ll be like a great like</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.240" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">a great symbolic act</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;ll it&#39;ll be really attractive and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">draw people in</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.119" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">but it won&#39;t be escaped because once</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">they&#39;re in there they&#39;ll be changed and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">transformed though</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">and and they&#39;ll and and it&#39;ll make them</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">their their lives i mean it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">take that much to bring that into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:31.839" style="s2">fandom</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">like in creating these things create</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.839" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">so that they afford recovery they afford</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">before transformation i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">like a really adjacent possible thing uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">people could be doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">sure would that uh become</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">like in your discussions with uh jordan</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">hall</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:56.800" style="s2">about the the religion that is not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.800" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">yeah yeah why not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:04.319" style="s2">yeah it could be i mean and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">daniel&#39;s trying to do with that with</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.319" end="00:53:08.400" style="s2">that live-action role-playing game</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to create a structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">whereby</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">people can engage in the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:15.200" style="s2">not a religion because</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">like like i&#39;ve argued earlier and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.200" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">not proselytizing for any religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">but these religions are store houses and</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">we should treat them with reverence</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">because they have been preserved and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">not like not as dead museums but as</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">living things</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">right they are storehouses for</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:35.040" style="s2">you know how to overcome self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">and how to afford enhanced meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.040" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">life that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:39.359" style="s2">those connections and those like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">that that deeper connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.359" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about throughout</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">there they they and so why not</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">learn as much as we can but the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">interesting thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">is we can play in a world where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">not committing to any crazy whacky</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:53:57.920" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">in order to in order to cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:03.119" style="s2">um in fact i was just thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:08.240" style="s2">so if there&#39;s a similar process uh to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">like the formation of like christianity</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.240" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">or something you know they had</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">the people that had so much less access</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">to information</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">this kind of one story emerges and</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">everyone has to hop on board with this</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:23.839" style="s2">and now we&#39;re in like this information</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">overload</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.839" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">so as a group of people doing something</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">like all creating their own story and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">everyone has like a meta awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">these are just stories</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">but we can exchange them with each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:39.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">they they achieve some kind of growth</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.440" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly it and and if the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">evolutionary analogy i gave you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">earlier works in some sense correct</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:55.040" style="s2">these stories</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">while being you know you know particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.040" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">that group are not again they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">disconnected from other stories because</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">there are shared processes</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">across the stories so you you could have</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">something much more</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:13.200" style="s2">you know like a co-op where</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">there are different groups doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.200" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">different things but they they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">they can talk to each other they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">facilitate each other and this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">already happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">at least it&#39;s happening in relevantly</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">similar domains in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">like i get i get involved with all these</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">communities uh you know there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">emerging communities around movement and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">mindfulness and self-transformation</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">and they&#39;re all and like and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">emerging and i would argue and many of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">them agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">in response to the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">and you have the same kind of pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">there&#39;s real universals between them so</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:49.920" style="s2">they can deeply talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">but there&#39;s no there&#39;s no wow but this</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.920" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">is the right set of practices</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">there&#39;s what it is is there&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:57.119" style="s2">call an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">but just like this could be an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.119" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">of practices there can be an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">in fact there should be an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:05.520" style="s2">stories enmeshed within</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">an ecology of practices that affords the</p>

<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:12.640" style="s2">to a person&#39;s life and context</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">this seems to give like a whole new</p>

<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">sometimes get get dismissed and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">been guilty of like being dismissive</p>

<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:23.230" style="s2">as well at times like fan fiction like</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">the whole process of creating</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">them become really ironic and rich and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">deep and</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:39.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something there well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the project</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.119" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">uh of internalizing harry potter the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">people internalize uh socrates</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because um</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">this was part of the the gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">tradition narcissism wasn&#39;t a religion</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">it&#39;s more like fundamentalism it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">and april the connect made that really</p>

<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">in the gnostic new age and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">of the things that really pissed off the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">emerging orthodox church</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:15.599" style="s2">is this kind of fan fiction was part of</p>

<p begin="00:57:15.599" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">you were expected to generate your own</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">gospels like like the the i like the</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">because it has the word life in the</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">everybody like there&#39;s this constant</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">proliferation of gospels and stories and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">myths</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">and practices and you know a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">they saw it as just crazy chaos</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">but again you you see you you see that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">um and for um and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">so i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">it&#39;s i mean i can understand why the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">church wanted to clamp it down because</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">it was trying to provide</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">you know a glue for the empire and blah</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">blah blah there&#39;s all these historical</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">but that wasn&#39;t an enormously powerful</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">powerful time and it it it shows that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to have a vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">in which you have an ecology of stories</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.880" style="s2">of practices and you have something</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:27.839" style="s2">deeply analogous to fan fiction</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.880" end="00:58:27.839" style="s2">constantly going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:33.359" style="s2">i&#39;m feeling a bit mind blown because i</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">really love the idea of this that</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:41.119" style="s2">something that could be drawn out of of</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:41.839" style="s2">sci-fi fandom uh or that it&#39;s all going</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.119" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">on there like</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.839" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">implicitly and there might of course be</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">a tremendous healing involved with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:49.760" style="s2">as well well it&#39;s the same thing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.760" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">very analogously to all these</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:54.319" style="s2">communities i&#39;m talking about i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">trying to be the founder of a religion</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.319" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s really deeply ridiculous what i</p>

<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">you know and i&#39;m trying to exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">with you is i&#39;d like to provide people</p>

<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">you know ecologies of practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:14.799" style="s2">really well vetted in terms of our</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">possibility that&#39;s what excites me</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">because we need i mean uh now i&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">a little bit more i don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">say i&#39;ve been serious throughout but</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">maybe a little bit more dour</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">we need to address the meaning crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">really do</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:47.920" style="s2">and i mean first of all the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">suffering it&#39;s causing is tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:52.240" style="s2">um and it&#39;s been exacerbated very</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">significantly i would argue by covid</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.240" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">um and the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">is really really weakening us</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">almost like an illness at a profound</p>

<p begin="01:00:06.000" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">that we can&#39;t deal with the other</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">pressing issues that are are really</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">threatening us with you know you know</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:22.319" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of stuff that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.319" end="01:00:25.920" style="s2">interesting thing is as you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">science fiction often addresses these</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.920" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">these concerns</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:30.880" style="s2">very very deeply very profoundly uh and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.880" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">i think if we have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">and this is why you know and this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">part of the discussions i have with</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">because his main argument is this meta</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">everything we can as massively and as</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">parallel</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">and as dynamically as we can right now i</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:01.839" style="s2">would argue and</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">you know i do think there&#39;s a potential</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.839" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">in what we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:06.799" style="s2">and if we could actualize that and</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">direct it towards</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">um stealing the culture um</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">i think that would be fantastic i i</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">would do everything</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">i could in my power to try and help</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">bring that about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something in jordan hall&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:24.240" style="s2">acceleration upon acceleration that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:27.520" style="s2">quite science fictional in itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.240" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.520" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">very much i&#39;m thinking very much yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.599" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">and we had to be able to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.040" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">with stories</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">you like a singularity kind of demands</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:45.359" style="s2">constantly remaking the story</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.400" end="01:01:46.960" style="s2">that is making sense yes because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.359" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">exactly fine</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.960" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s exactly that and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">jordan and i have talked about how that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">brings with it</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:57.039" style="s2">like there&#39;s a faith in these stories</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:01:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.039" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">uh well it&#39;s in i would say it&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.119" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">of the older meanings of faith</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">faith is just has become this assertion</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">of things you shouldn&#39;t believe sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.359" style="s2">asserting things that don&#39;t have good</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">evidence or reason behind them um</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.359" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">um but there&#39;s a there&#39;s an older</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">meaning and it&#39;s still present in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">word faithfulness</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:21.520" style="s2">like me being faithful to my partner</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that i believe</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.520" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">crazy things about her it means that</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:29.119" style="s2">i couple myself so that i&#39;m constantly</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">renewing</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.119" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">what i can be and how i can see her so</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:36.400" style="s2">she can constantly grow</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:38.400" style="s2">in how she can be and we are committed</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:40.240" style="s2">to that we are faithful to each other</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.400" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to maintain a continuity of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.240" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">contact not give</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">some final version of anything we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">trying to give a final</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:50.319" style="s2">solution ominous words there or a final</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">story about anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.319" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not what being faithful means at</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">all and so jordan and i talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:57.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">right this on go again similar to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.839" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">gnostics right this process of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:05.119" style="s2">ongoing re re-inventio</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">the the latin word invention inventio</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.119" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">it means simultaneously to create and to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:13.119" style="s2">discover so i&#39;d like to use that term</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:14.079" style="s2">you know the constant inventio of new</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.119" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.079" end="01:03:18.160" style="s2">that keep us faithful to a reality that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:20.319" style="s2">is itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.160" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">undergoing significant change the way i</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.319" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">am faithful</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">to this very complex being</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">called my my my lover right she is</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">right she&#39;s incredibly complex as any</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">person is</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s and alicia yoraro talks about</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:38.240" style="s2">you know what stories are really good</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">for uh she&#39;s one of the people that did</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">a lot of important work on the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">stories get you formatting your your</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">so that you are in the right form of</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">information processing</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:53.599" style="s2">for tracking dynamical systems and so if</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">the world is</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.599" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">right this massively complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">self-organizing dynamical mess</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">which it is we need stories that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">themselves recursively changing</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:08.799" style="s2">so that we can track that in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:09.440" style="s2">a week we can maintain a continuity of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">contact</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.440" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">we can be faithful to that ever-changing</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:16.559" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">and so again i think science fiction and</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.559" end="01:04:20.000" style="s2">fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">point the way uh for doing that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.000" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking for a little bit over</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.039" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">over an hour i don&#39;t want to take up too</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.559" end="01:04:30.400" style="s2">much of your time</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">uh well i mean i i can talk for another</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.400" end="01:04:33.440" style="s2">10 15 minutes or so</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">but yeah but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.440" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">always i also don&#39;t want to be imposing</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">so no no that&#39;s fine because i i there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:40.400" style="s2">another question i&#39;d like to ask and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:42.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.400" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">we&#39;re also like just on the edge of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.799" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">something really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:51.039" style="s2">which uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:52.400" style="s2">kind of this recursive nature of stories</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.039" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">so that seems to be in</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.400" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">science fiction absolutely science</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:57.440" style="s2">fiction writers are looking really</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:04:59.440" style="s2">closely at</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.440" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">the the point of the world where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.440" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:05.920" style="s2">yeah like stitch new metaphors around it</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:07.520" style="s2">and then those stories are like being</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.920" end="01:05:09.599" style="s2">brought back into a community</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.520" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">who are either accepting them or</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.599" end="01:05:14.799" style="s2">rejecting them</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">and then putting them into the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.799" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">and i think that relates to the question</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">i wanted to ask because</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">um you know i i&#39;ve like spoken to like</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">quite well-known physicists</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">you know and they secretly tell me about</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">their interest in science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">yes uh like uh and you know you yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">you said you&#39;re a big science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">fan and i assume</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">like you would be so it&#39;s kind of there</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.400" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">in our intellectual life</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">but we also feel like we can&#39;t like talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">about it or put it at the center</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:46.240" style="s2">of of things that we&#39;re doing quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.559" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">often i&#39;m interested in why</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.240" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">that is sometimes maybe you have some</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">experience of why</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:53.599" style="s2">i do and i i want to explore that with</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:54.240" style="s2">you because i think that&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.599" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.240" end="01:05:57.039" style="s2">because i want to do what i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">before i want to set it into a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.039" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">family of where people do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:02.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s other things that people</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">won&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.400" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">but have a profound impact even on how</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">they do their science you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">like 40</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">of the population have mystical</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:14.720" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:15.920" style="s2">yeah right or right or these profound</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.720" end="01:06:18.480" style="s2">experiences of awe</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.920" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">and transformative experiences and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.480" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">you like</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">if you get if you take somebody out and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.119" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">have a dinner with a scientist and</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:26.319" style="s2">you know give them perhaps a little bit</p>

<p begin="01:06:26.319" end="01:06:29.440" style="s2">why did you get into this first i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">give you the career answer the one that</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.440" end="01:06:33.760" style="s2">they have to put on this cv</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">right blah blah blah but wait and go and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.760" end="01:06:38.079" style="s2">then you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.720" end="01:06:40.319" style="s2">no no they&#39;re actually they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.079" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">wrestling with problems of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.319" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">right and making sense and they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:45.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">there&#39;s been often something that really</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.680" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">they had a moment where they had a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.319" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">and you know both in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:53.680" style="s2">they&#39;re aware and and also the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">being connected to what&#39;s more real and</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.680" end="01:06:57.760" style="s2">that really</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:07:02.720" style="s2">uh drives them um and yet</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.760" end="01:07:02.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t talk about these experiences</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.039" end="01:07:09.920" style="s2">because they&#39;re not part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:12.400" style="s2">the sort of i don&#39;t know what to call it</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.920" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">the enlightenment model of how the mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.400" end="01:07:16.559" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:17.599" style="s2">which is right this model that the mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:20.720" style="s2">is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.599" end="01:07:23.440" style="s2">uh monolithic monological thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.720" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">that right works best on its own and</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.440" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:27.599" style="s2">self-sufficient and this is all [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:31.440" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s really not true about how we</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:34.799" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.440" end="01:07:37.920" style="s2">um and uh so</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.799" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">we that doesn&#39;t have to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.920" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">if you go back far enough like even just</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:42.799" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.559" style="s2">in the renaissance you can see it but</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.799" end="01:07:46.640" style="s2">farther back you can also see it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.559" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">uh when you had like a neoplatonic world</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.640" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">view people thought it was</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">very vitally important that their</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:53.039" style="s2">spirituality and their scientific</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:55.359" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.039" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">were deeply interwoven mutually</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.359" end="01:08:00.079" style="s2">explicated and mutually afforded</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:01.599" style="s2">but for various historical reasons that</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.079" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">i go over in the series</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:05.520" style="s2">right awakening for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve now got a place where those are</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.520" end="01:08:08.640" style="s2">oppositional to each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">and the thing about it here&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.640" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">good the thing about it i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:13.119" style="s2">propose to you damian</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">is science fiction has enough and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.119" end="01:08:14.720" style="s2">been talking about it all throughout</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.720" end="01:08:19.199" style="s2">it has it&#39;s it&#39;s close enough maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">at the ideal level but really at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.199" end="01:08:24.440" style="s2">procedural and existential level</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">it&#39;s close enough to a and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.440" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:29.520" style="s2">and all of this stuff it&#39;s right even</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">trying to induce ah</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.520" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">right and you know and god-like beings</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">can show up in it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:37.359" style="s2">and people can undergo radical</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:40.799" style="s2">transformation like</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.359" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">all of that that&#39;s just too close</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.799" end="01:08:45.920" style="s2">to spirituality and religion and</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:48.799" style="s2">mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.920" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">and all that kind of stuff and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.799" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">take that</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:53.120" style="s2">seriously right you don&#39;t take that</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:56.480" style="s2">seriously because</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.120" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">even though it&#39;s not true we think</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.480" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">that you know scientists are these like</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">so and i i want to make another point</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:06.239" style="s2">because it has to do with current work</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:08.319" style="s2">i&#39;m doing about scientists</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.239" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">and exactly this kind of thing and this</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.319" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">is work i&#39;m doing with dan shapi</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:14.159" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got the nasa scientists</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">literal rocket scientists in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.159" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">who are moving around the rovers on mars</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:19.199" style="s2">like your spirit</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">and opportunity right they&#39;re moving the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">rovers around now because of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:25.120" style="s2">of the of the delay there&#39;s no joystick</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:26.640" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:28.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no joystick control so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.640" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">like a video game at all what they do is</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.640" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">they get</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">batches of black and white pictures</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.359" end="01:09:34.159" style="s2">right that they</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.400" end="01:09:35.440" style="s2">pour over and then they send back</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.159" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">batches of command</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.440" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s all this delay so you that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:44.080" style="s2">sounds all very abstract and cold</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">but what do they look for they</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.080" end="01:09:47.440" style="s2">what what are they looking for when they</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:48.400" style="s2">try to hire somebody into the group this</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.440" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">goes to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.400" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">ethnography done by for testing another</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">they look for people who can generate</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">experience they feel like they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">mars</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:09:59.600" style="s2">a sense of being on mars they can</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">somehow right which is exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.600" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">people want in the video game right that</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:04.719" style="s2">sense of presence</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.239" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">the sense it&#39;s real because i&#39;m i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.719" end="01:10:08.640" style="s2">it i&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:11.120" style="s2">i am in the video world it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.640" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">to do with how real the video world is</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.120" end="01:10:15.199" style="s2">because people can get the uh that sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">of presence in things like tetris</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.199" end="01:10:18.320" style="s2">so how are these scientists getting this</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:20.880" style="s2">sense of being</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">on mars and why is that so important</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.880" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">well they do this</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">really weird stuff they do this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">first of all they identify with the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.520" end="01:10:33.199" style="s2">rover they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:35.600" style="s2">i need to go here or we need to go there</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.199" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">or i can&#39;t move my wheel right now</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.600" end="01:10:38.960" style="s2">and and so they don&#39;t say the rover they</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">first of all they so they</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.960" end="01:10:43.120" style="s2">anthropomorphize the rover</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">but they also technomorphize themselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.120" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">so they do stuff like this they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">okay uh they&#39;ll put the phone put the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:49.520" style="s2">phone in front of them and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">oh wait there&#39;s a rock and they&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.520" end="01:10:52.239" style="s2">their hands up like this and say and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">they&#39;re on a swivel chair</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.239" end="01:10:56.159" style="s2">i need to like in these and they do and</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">they what they do is they they enact</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.159" end="01:10:59.520" style="s2">remember symbolically enacted they enact</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">being the rover</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:04.480" style="s2">they unhacked it right they enact it</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:07.600" style="s2">right they technomorphize themselves</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.480" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">and this gets so weird right they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.600" end="01:11:12.480" style="s2">and i wish i had it up but this is like</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve got talks online if people want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">see it where i actually read the literal</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">quotes</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:18.159" style="s2">so i&#39;m not you know i&#39;m not ex i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">exaggerating here</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.159" end="01:11:21.760" style="s2">they&#39;ll say stuff like this you know i</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.920" end="01:11:25.120" style="s2">was working in the garden</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.760" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">and my my my right wrist kept hurting me</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.120" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">and went and then i got to the lab and</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">rover&#39;s right wheel wasn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:35.679" style="s2">and you know i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s magic</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.000" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">but there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.679" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">except they do this weird stuff</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">now they don&#39;t put any of that in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:45.840" style="s2">articles they publish</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">yeah of course not but all of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.840" end="01:11:50.239" style="s2">enacted</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:52.800" style="s2">symbolism all of that bleed</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.239" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">is what they&#39;re looking for because that</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.800" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">actually gives people knowing what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">like to be on mars</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">and that enables them to do the field</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.840" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">do the science but we don&#39;t report it</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:08.400" style="s2">any of that because no no no</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">and and but but but that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.400" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">actually doing in order to do the</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">so with the line there between them</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.320" end="01:12:20.719" style="s2">doing the science</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:22.960" style="s2">and something paul anderson like wrote</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.719" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">a really classic science fiction story</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.960" end="01:12:26.640" style="s2">call me joe</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:29.120" style="s2">right where he&#39;s sort of like he&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.640" end="01:12:30.960" style="s2">of connecting to some biological avatar</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.120" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">on a planet to do exploration</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:36.400" style="s2">and eventually the identity between him</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.120" end="01:12:38.480" style="s2">and that biological avatar breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.400" end="01:12:39.600" style="s2">and he right it&#39;s the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.480" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">the scientists</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.600" end="01:12:44.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing with the scientists</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">and the rover yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.320" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">well there&#39;s something like really</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">interesting in science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:52.400" style="s2">just in like the two words for science</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:55.600" style="s2">and fiction it is this meeting</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.400" end="01:13:00.159" style="s2">of yeah exactly the these things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.600" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">are shouldn&#39;t be mixed yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.159" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">spectrum of people who are into science</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:05.920" style="s2">fiction</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:07.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s a solid group of</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.920" end="01:13:09.360" style="s2">people who are like the hard science</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:11.520" style="s2">fiction fans</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.360" end="01:13:12.640" style="s2">and they consciously they just want the</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.520" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">book to just</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:18.400" style="s2">expand on ideas from science and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">like an annoyance or an anger if it does</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">something fantastical around that</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:24.640" style="s2">and i can see a really good reason for</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">that because you want to look just at</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.640" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:28.719" style="s2">of what&#39;s changing in the world so</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a relative reason</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.719" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">and i can also see that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.440" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:35.920" style="s2">within yourself that you&#39;re trying not</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:39.679" style="s2">to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.920" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">in that yeah exactly as well</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.679" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">but i love what you just said i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:46.640" style="s2">thought about it that</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.239" end="01:13:48.320" style="s2">that way but that&#39;s brilliant symbol on</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.640" end="01:13:50.880" style="s2">means to join together</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">the greek word symbol and you the word</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.880" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">like science fiction is joy</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:56.000" style="s2">you said we&#39;re joining together the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">things that shouldn&#39;t be joined together</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.000" end="01:13:59.199" style="s2">but of course that&#39;s what all symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:01.920" style="s2">behavior does</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.199" end="01:14:03.199" style="s2">um i hadn&#39;t thought about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">really good</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.199" end="01:14:07.600" style="s2">that&#39;s really good so i guess maybe one</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">way of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:10.880" style="s2">encapsulating what i&#39;ve been saying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:11.840" style="s2">you is we should be joining them</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:15.840" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.840" end="01:14:18.719" style="s2">we should we should and um</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.840" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">i understand why people like uh hard</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.719" end="01:14:23.199" style="s2">science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:24.320" style="s2">i get that but the problem with hard</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.199" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.320" end="01:14:28.960" style="s2">uh is well not not not problem because</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.960" end="01:14:34.239" style="s2">problematic about it one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:36.239" style="s2">what that i would find problematic is</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.239" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">people being imperial about it saying</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.239" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">only this counts or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.840" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:46.719" style="s2">when i look at the hard science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:49.840" style="s2">from the 1950s it seems so stupid</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.719" end="01:14:51.679" style="s2">now because the science right the</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.840" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">science that they thought</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.679" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">was going to be the unchallenged science</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">has been massively</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:15:02.239" style="s2">challenged and overturned um and</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:05.199" style="s2">and the fact that there&#39;s also now</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.239" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like some of our sciences like</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.199" end="01:15:09.360" style="s2">biology and cognitive science</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:10.080" style="s2">are going through almost all almost</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.360" end="01:15:12.080" style="s2">revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.080" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">changes um in there and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.080" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:20.000" style="s2">and so people should perhaps be</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:21.199" style="s2">a little bit looser about the commitment</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.000" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">to the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.199" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">uh within a scientific world view</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">now i under like i&#39;m not i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">espousing irrationalism or anything</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:32.080" style="s2">ridiculous like this</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:32.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.920" end="01:15:36.880" style="s2">what&#39;s the worry with uh with science</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.920" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">fiction that&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.880" end="01:15:42.000" style="s2">speculative</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:43.920" style="s2">is it that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.000" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">and you alluded to this what&#39;s it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.920" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">like what&#39;s the what&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.600" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">it like</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">uh because it&#39;s not real that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:51.360" style="s2">the answer because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">all of its scientific like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.360" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">concern maybe i should ask you instead</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">making it a rhetorical question what do</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:15:57.679" style="s2">you think like you you have more</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:16:00.480" style="s2">familiarity with this</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.679" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">with this group than i do like i said i</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.480" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">i cut my teeth on new wave</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">and new wave was the critical response</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.360" end="01:16:10.000" style="s2">to hard sci-fi</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:12.400" style="s2">right right right so i&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.000" end="01:16:14.159" style="s2">i i i maybe i should be i mean i&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:14.880" style="s2">some of the hard sci-fi like highland</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.159" end="01:16:16.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:18.000" style="s2">other people earlier people like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.239" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">but actually when you when you go</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.000" end="01:16:21.120" style="s2">looking for it it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:23.360" style="s2">really find</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.120" end="01:16:24.640" style="s2">hard science yeah because science</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.360" end="01:16:28.239" style="s2">fiction will ins</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.640" end="01:16:30.960" style="s2">just insist on becoming fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.239" end="01:16:33.360" style="s2">in some way it just yeah and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.960" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">however much you try to limit yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.360" end="01:16:38.000" style="s2">to just like a purely materialist idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.840" end="01:16:41.679" style="s2">of the world your imagination is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.000" end="01:16:45.199" style="s2">like escape around it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.679" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">i think what&#39;s happening is that uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.199" end="01:16:51.679" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of of personal fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">that really appeal to people who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.679" end="01:16:55.360" style="s2">uh just to that that hard science</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:57.280" style="s2">fiction mindset</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.360" end="01:16:59.760" style="s2">so actually what&#39;s going on inside the</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.280" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">story is like the fulfillment of lots of</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.760" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">personal fantasies right</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:06.320" style="s2">not actually being a robot that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:06.880" style="s2">somebody&#39;s fantasy but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.320" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.880" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">that yeah right expresses that</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:14.880" style="s2">so you it&#39;s a way of saying that like my</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:17.360" style="s2">fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.880" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">is very real and important and other</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.360" end="01:17:22.560" style="s2">people&#39;s fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:23.840" style="s2">aren&#39;t oh so it&#39;s just narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.560" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">well i think there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.840" end="01:17:28.880" style="s2">that in there a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:31.280" style="s2">but it it&#39;s probably very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:33.320" style="s2">escape because</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.280" end="01:17:35.280" style="s2">you know you&#39;re you you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.320" end="01:17:37.920" style="s2">reinforced</p>

<p begin="01:17:37.920" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">culture that your world view is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:43.199" style="s2">completely correct</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">right right already and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">difficult to get out of that</p>

<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:18:00.080" style="s2">i mean philosophical in the way we</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">currently use it meaning this you know</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.199" end="01:18:27.440" style="s2">and and and right it if you aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.440" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">and at least in a symbolic world</p>

<p begin="01:19:18.480" end="01:19:25.199" style="s2">is not the knowledge i</p>

<p begin="01:19:48.880" end="01:19:52.080" style="s2">and we think there&#39;s something really</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:56.320" style="s2">you&#39;re only using it for this one</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.320" end="01:20:00.719" style="s2">framework this this one in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.199" end="01:20:04.000" style="s2">we can open it to many many</p>

<p begin="01:20:24.159" end="01:20:27.840" style="s2">right right and there&#39;s been like a huge</p>

<p begin="01:20:27.840" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">significantly before it manifested like</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:38.320" style="s2">across the culture oh nice period</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.120" end="01:20:41.199" style="s2">uh and it was really you know the</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.320" end="01:20:42.320" style="s2">uh about diversity that was the word</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.199" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">that you&#39;d give it</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.320" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">in the awards but it really was about</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2">intellectual diversity you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:53.520" style="s2">what are we actually talking about uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.840" end="01:20:54.480" style="s2">in science fiction uh and that was like</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.520" end="01:20:56.480" style="s2">a huge</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.480" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">a huge fight online i was writing about</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.480" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">it for the guardian at the time</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">so it was uh it was very interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.840" end="01:21:05.440" style="s2">lipro and i could see it</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">kind of mirroring out into the broader</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.440" end="01:21:09.120" style="s2">culture right right</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:10.480" style="s2">wow that&#39;s really pressing it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.120" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.480" end="01:21:16.560" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool i remember</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:18.000" style="s2">hitting like i don&#39;t read as much as i</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.560" end="01:21:21.360" style="s2">used to because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.000" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">so busy um</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:27.440" style="s2">but i i remember i guess</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">i i i see it retrospectively now like i</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.440" end="01:21:30.320" style="s2">was bumping up against something when i</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:33.280" style="s2">read ancillary justice</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.320" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">and i was getting that in from that that</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.280" end="01:21:35.920" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:37.679" style="s2">uh even the way she&#39;s using pronouns in</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.920" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">that book oh that was like</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.679" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">the book that defines</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:44.880" style="s2">that that latest kind of shift in</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:47.760" style="s2">science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.880" end="01:21:48.639" style="s2">right right done a lot cyberpunk had</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.760" end="01:21:49.920" style="s2">done a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.639" end="01:21:52.000" style="s2">but it was still kind of very</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.920" end="01:21:54.840" style="s2">monocultural</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.000" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">ancillary justice was like the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.840" end="01:21:59.040" style="s2">breakthrough of a lot of women writers</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.400" style="s2">and writers of color all happened around</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.040" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">that time</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.400" end="01:22:04.480" style="s2">right right and science fiction is much</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:06.480" style="s2">more interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.480" end="01:22:07.520" style="s2">for it like it&#39;s truly fascinating at</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.480" end="01:22:09.760" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">what&#39;s being made science fiction fields</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.760" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible to keep track of as well</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:13.840" style="s2">because there&#39;s just far too much</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:17.920" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.840" end="01:22:20.639" style="s2">uh well yeah we have the proliferation</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.920" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">of pluralism uh but again that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.639" end="01:22:23.440" style="s2">mean that</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">it has to that doesn&#39;t connote or have</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.440" end="01:22:27.679" style="s2">to connect or even denote</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:29.040" style="s2">chaos i mean there&#39;s a possibility like</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.679" end="01:22:31.199" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.040" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">about it about of there being</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.199" end="01:22:34.960" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:37.679" style="s2">uh coordination uh between all of these</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.960" end="01:22:37.679" style="s2">different aspects</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.760" end="01:22:44.719" style="s2">have you ever been to uh a world con</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.760" end="01:22:44.960" style="s2">science fiction community i i i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.719" end="01:22:46.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.960" end="01:22:47.600" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t i haven&#39;t been to a science</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.480" end="01:22:48.400" style="s2">fiction world and i&#39;ve been to like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.600" end="01:22:51.679" style="s2">comic-con</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.400" end="01:22:52.400" style="s2">and okay like that uh very similar in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.679" end="01:22:55.600" style="s2">lot of ways</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.400" end="01:22:57.760" style="s2">yeah uh and and i was just i remember</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.600" end="01:22:59.199" style="s2">that went into the the book chapter that</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.760" end="01:23:00.480" style="s2">chris and philip and i wrote because i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:02.159" style="s2">come away from one of those</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.480" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">and i went and i said i&#39;ve just been in</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.159" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">this like i was just</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.760" end="01:23:07.199" style="s2">like overwhelmed by how religious and i</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.000" end="01:23:11.120" style="s2">think that&#39;s the right word</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:13.760" style="s2">this event was and it was like wow</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.120" end="01:23:15.040" style="s2">wow i mean if if if if christianity</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.760" end="01:23:18.239" style="s2">could tap into this</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.040" end="01:23:20.639" style="s2">the churches would be packed right uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.239" end="01:23:21.600" style="s2">and it was like so yeah i have been and</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.639" end="01:23:24.960" style="s2">i like it</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.600" end="01:23:25.600" style="s2">it had this um just a huge impression on</p>
