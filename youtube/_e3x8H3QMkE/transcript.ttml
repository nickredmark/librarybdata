<p begin="00:00:15.380" end="00:00:18.590" style="s2">out to be the fall of Gaddafi&#39;s regime</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.670" end="00:00:21.770" style="s2">the rebels were coming into Tripoli</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.590" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">there was gunfire in the air we got into</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.660" end="00:00:32.689" style="s2">life where I felt like I&#39;m in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.220" end="00:00:35.360" style="s2">of history this feels like an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.689" end="00:00:37.130" style="s2">place and I got my phone out and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.360" end="00:00:39.079" style="s2">called my parents I was like I just want</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.130" end="00:00:40.610" style="s2">to hit get them to hear about all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.079" end="00:00:43.010" style="s2">guns going off this kind of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.610" end="00:00:45.020" style="s2">moment and I got my mom on the phone and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">I spoke to her and I was like listen to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.020" end="00:00:54.140" style="s2">this this is amazing and then literally</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:57.350" style="s2">surrounded by kind of yeah this this</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.140" end="00:01:00.170" style="s2">incredible moment and she started crying</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.350" end="00:01:03.770" style="s2">and I was like what&#39;s the matter and she</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.170" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">said I&#39;m at the hospital your dad&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.770" end="00:01:12.229" style="s2">been diagnosed with cancer we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:15.260" style="s2">too much but we know it&#39;s bad and he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.229" end="00:01:17.299" style="s2">63 years old he was fit he was though</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.260" end="00:01:19.580" style="s2">literally just been on a cycling holiday</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.299" end="00:01:22.700" style="s2">that the week before when he felt ill</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.580" end="00:01:24.140" style="s2">and had gone in and we knew at stomach</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.700" end="00:01:25.700" style="s2">cancer we knew that the prognosis for</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.140" end="00:01:31.130" style="s2">stomach cancer wasn&#39;t really wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.700" end="00:01:35.320" style="s2">good and I then broke down in tears as</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.130" end="00:01:35.320" style="s2">well and got home as quickly as I could</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.850" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">well I should fill you in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.810" end="00:01:45.500" style="s2">of the backstory before I won in the air</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:47.150" style="s2">flying from Libya back to the UK I never</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.500" end="00:01:52.549" style="s2">got on well with my father we always</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.150" end="00:01:54.200" style="s2">fought and yeah throughout my one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.549" end="00:01:56.509" style="s2">the primal memories that I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.200" end="00:01:59.240" style="s2">shared with a few of you today is that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.509" end="00:02:00.920" style="s2">remember the thing that the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.240" end="00:02:01.460" style="s2">realized later when I did a lot of men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.920" end="00:02:03.049" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.460" end="00:02:04.729" style="s2">that annoyed me I knew I fought with him</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.049" end="00:02:06.710" style="s2">I didn&#39;t really know why until it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.729" end="00:02:10.189" style="s2">later on it can set I contextualise that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.710" end="00:02:14.059" style="s2">I understood it and it was because he</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.189" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">was a sort of 1780s new man he really</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.059" end="00:02:16.909" style="s2">wanted to be different from the father</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:19.159" style="s2">figures of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.909" end="00:02:21.530" style="s2">we really wanted to be someone different</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.159" end="00:02:24.349" style="s2">which is why I felt it was so tragic</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.530" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">that when we used to play football he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.349" end="00:02:27.049" style="s2">be like why did why do you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">a goal why can&#39;t just pass it to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.049" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">other that&#39;s kind of and I never</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">realized at the time but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.329" style="s2">this denial of the male competition the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:38.269" style="s2">male drive the male kind of like mmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.329" end="00:02:39.859" style="s2">that feeling and I remember fighting</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.269" end="00:02:41.870" style="s2">with him and I remember fighting them to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.859" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">the point where he grabbed me by my</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.870" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">throat and held me up against the wall</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:49.639" style="s2">once and I can remember the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.040" end="00:02:53.389" style="s2">euphoria in me when he did that because</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.639" end="00:02:55.159" style="s2">it was like yes and I know again I never</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.389" end="00:02:56.269" style="s2">contextualized it until later but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.159" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">was what I was doing is looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.269" end="00:02:59.930" style="s2">boundary I was looking for that point I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.639" style="s2">was looking for that place in him and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.930" end="00:03:03.470" style="s2">found it and I know from my mum later</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.639" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">that really traumatized him like he</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.470" end="00:03:07.939" style="s2">really he really struggled with that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.730" style="s2">fact that I pushed into that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.939" end="00:03:13.250" style="s2">that he realized he had that in him and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.730" end="00:03:18.470" style="s2">it he really struggle with it for a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.250" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">time afterwards and it was only sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.470" end="00:03:23.720" style="s2">through men&#39;s work later on that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">realized that really owning that pardon</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.720" end="00:03:27.290" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:29.239" style="s2">was was a really essential thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.290" end="00:03:33.349" style="s2">that dark side that that killer that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.239" end="00:03:35.090" style="s2">that kind of yeah that part that we all</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.349" end="00:03:39.349" style="s2">have that in a totalitarian that in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.090" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">kind of Dominator that&#39;s when I realized</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.349" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">later I felt safe and that&#39;s why I felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:48.530" style="s2">safe when I saw that part of him a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:52.459" style="s2">of context so now I&#39;ve landed in London</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.530" end="00:03:58.970" style="s2">and going to Southampton I arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.459" end="00:04:04.449" style="s2">the hospital and I see my father and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.970" end="00:04:09.229" style="s2">go up to him and I just embrace him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.449" end="00:04:11.329" style="s2">I keep embracing him and my friend who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.229" end="00:04:13.579" style="s2">brought me to the hospital realizes</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.329" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">after about five minutes of this hug</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.579" end="00:04:18.349" style="s2">that he&#39;s in the presence of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:21.289" style="s2">really special and he takes a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.349" end="00:04:23.960" style="s2">it which is now on my wall at home like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.289" end="00:04:26.389" style="s2">this amazing picture and I&#39;ve had lots</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.960" end="00:04:27.529" style="s2">of people reflect that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.389" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">like lots of people have said how</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.529" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">powerful that picture is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.280" style="s2">something about the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">holding him and the way he&#39;s collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.280" end="00:04:36.750" style="s2">into me that feels like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">transfer or of there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:43.500" style="s2">something shifts at this moment and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:45.420" style="s2">after that I realized I thought he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.500" end="00:04:46.950" style="s2">going to be gone in he was given three</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.420" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">months to live basically after that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.950" end="00:04:50.580" style="s2">went back into the hospital they did</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:53.790" style="s2">tests he said yeah you&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.580" end="00:04:57.660" style="s2">months to live and so I sent him a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.790" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">letter saying look I&#39;ve done all of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">in a work I&#39;ve done all of this men&#39;s</p>
