<p begin="00:00:01.040" end="00:00:07.529" style="s2">anyways so you&#39;re always in in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.220" end="00:00:09.240" style="s2">situation and then this is occurs across</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.529" end="00:00:10.860" style="s2">multiple levels of analysis because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.240" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">could say well winner you in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.860" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">and one answer could be well when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">in a beautiful house or in a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">hotel or in a well-functioning</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">institution or in a city that&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.850" end="00:00:23.090" style="s2">but I can also say you&#39;re in a garden</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">when you&#39;re conception of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.090" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">sufficient that when you enact it it</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:30.330" style="s2">allows the world to be fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:32.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a garden too right because so</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">your internal psychological structure</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">the conceptions that you use first of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">all there are obviously analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">culture but they&#39;re also analogous to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">garden in that way and light culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">they can be disrupted so you know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like people they say this all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">time I wish that hadn&#39;t happened and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">what they mean by that is geez I was in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">a pretty good place before that event</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:00:59.879" style="s2">occurred you know and a big moral error</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">can really do that to you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.879" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">do something that you really think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:07.130" style="s2">stupid and you know you you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">shattered really</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.130" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">sometimes shattered enough to develop</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">can&#39;t get rid of the snakes that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">first idea in the story well then the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">issue is well what do you do with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:27.689" style="s2">stakes well God basically told even Adam</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">not well he didn&#39;t really tell them not</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.689" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">to interact with the snakes and he put a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.670" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">snake in there I think it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">because in a sense it&#39;s not possible to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">create a garden without having a snake</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">in it because you can&#39;t keep everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">out it&#39;s not possible okay so the snake</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">comes along and it says well if you do</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">this thing that god forbade a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">wonderful things will happen well this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:55.670" style="s2">is where it gets exhibited gets</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:55.670" style="s2">extraordinarily complicated you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.630" end="00:02:02.900" style="s2">let me finish that this part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.180" end="00:02:04.340" style="s2">story and then we&#39;ll go back the serpent</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.900" end="00:02:06.170" style="s2">said unto the woman ye shall not surely</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.340" end="00:02:07.670" style="s2">die for God knows that in the day you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.170" end="00:02:09.500" style="s2">eat thereof then your eyes will be</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.670" end="00:02:11.000" style="s2">opened and you will be as God&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.500" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">good and evil okay so what can we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.000" end="00:02:16.390" style="s2">conclude from that well the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:19.970" style="s2">is is that their eyes were closed</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.390" end="00:02:22.520" style="s2">because if they weren&#39;t closed and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.970" end="00:02:23.810" style="s2">could they be opened and the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.520" end="00:02:26.270" style="s2">thing is they didn&#39;t know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:29.000" style="s2">between good and evil okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.270" end="00:02:30.920" style="s2">explains the whole ashame naked and not</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.000" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">ashamed issue because if your eyes are</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.920" end="00:02:34.370" style="s2">closed well that&#39;s irrelevant and if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:37.550" style="s2">know if there&#39;s no moral knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.370" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously no shame so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.550" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">happening here is that there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:50.030" style="s2">profound distinction being made between</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">the before fruit eating state of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.030" end="00:02:55.100" style="s2">in the after fruit eating state of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">or the before fruit eating and snake</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.100" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">interacting mode of being and the after</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:03:00.920" style="s2">fruit eating and snake interacting mode</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:02.799" style="s2">of being and I think it&#39;s reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.920" end="00:03:07.790" style="s2">think of that on a historical timeline</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.799" end="00:03:09.890" style="s2">you know that that is one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.790" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">those are two of the major forces that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:12.950" style="s2">shaped our evolutionary history and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.690" end="00:03:14.510" style="s2">idea that things were different before</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.950" end="00:03:17.209" style="s2">that and after that is a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.510" end="00:03:19.160" style="s2">reasonable presupposition something put</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.209" end="00:03:21.620" style="s2">us on the path to very very rapid</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.160" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">cortical development vision is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.620" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">one of those factors so and the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:28.670" style="s2">eating element well that&#39;s where we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:30.880" style="s2">color vision so it isn&#39;t obvious exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.670" end="00:03:34.700" style="s2">what that did but it did a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.880" end="00:03:36.200" style="s2">so and then the next thing is well</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.700" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">there&#39;s no moral knowledge now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.200" end="00:03:40.250" style="s2">interesting because it implies that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:41.930" style="s2">there&#39;s some tight link between having</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.250" end="00:03:44.510" style="s2">your eyes closed and not having moral</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.930" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">knowledge so to have your eyes closed is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.510" end="00:03:48.790" style="s2">to not to be able to see so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">kind of unconsciousness about it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.790" end="00:03:52.700" style="s2">when the woman saw that the tree was</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:55.640" style="s2">good for food and that was pleasant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:03:58.010" style="s2">the eyes and a tree to be desired to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.640" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">make one wise she took of the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.010" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">thereof and did eat and gave also unto</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">her husband with her and he did eat</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.520" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">and the eyes of both of them were opened</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.070" end="00:04:10.520" style="s2">and they knew they were naked and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:13.070" style="s2">sewed fig leaves together and made</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.520" end="00:04:15.080" style="s2">themselves aprons okay so that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.070" end="00:04:16.580" style="s2">an interesting sequence of events so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.080" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">they&#39;re tempted by this thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.580" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">subtle and dangerous and the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:23.690" style="s2">of the temptation is the ingestion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:26.030" style="s2">something the incorporation of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.690" end="00:04:28.490" style="s2">with transformative properties and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.030" end="00:04:31.670" style="s2">transformation is profound what happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.490" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">is they open their eyes well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.670" end="00:04:36.380" style="s2">coming to consciousness that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">what that is now when a kitten opens its</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.380" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">eyes it finally enters the world you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">know so people had their eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">before this event well so they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:52.850" style="s2">they weren&#39;t conscious in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:56.170" style="s2">and that would account for the unity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.850" end="00:04:58.700" style="s2">experience they&#39;re not separated from</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.170" end="00:05:00.410" style="s2">they&#39;re not separate beings on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.700" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">ground of existence that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.410" end="00:05:02.930" style="s2">thinking but they have the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:06.770" style="s2">life as animals do you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.930" end="00:05:09.650" style="s2">they&#39;re just unconscious or at least non</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.770" end="00:05:11.090" style="s2">self conscious entities of nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.650" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">there&#39;s no nakedness there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.090" end="00:05:15.080" style="s2">knowledge of good and evil I mean do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:16.940" style="s2">you don&#39;t blame a lion for eating it for</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.080" end="00:05:18.770" style="s2">reading a sheep well they did this thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.940" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">yeah they used to eat sheep in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.770" end="00:05:23.270" style="s2">Middle East right you don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:23.870" style="s2">an evil they don&#39;t think of the lion as</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.270" end="00:05:25.640" style="s2">evil</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.870" end="00:05:27.590" style="s2">you just think that that&#39;s what Lions do</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.640" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">now someone comes along and steals your</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.590" end="00:05:30.230" style="s2">sheep well that&#39;s a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">issue all of a sudden there&#39;s a moral</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.230" end="00:05:33.470" style="s2">issue that&#39;s overlaid upon that and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">say well you might say well why is all</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.470" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">of a sudden there a moral issue and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.560" style="s2">the answer to that would be well the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:41.690" style="s2">person either does know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.560" end="00:05:44.210" style="s2">between good and bad or should know it</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.690" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">you know and if he says well I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.210" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">acting like a lion that&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">not going to no one&#39;s going to accept</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:51.020" style="s2">that as an excuse and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:52.220" style="s2">that is there&#39;s a basic assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.020" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">there&#39;s something that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.220" end="00:05:55.850" style="s2">lions don&#39;t and that why well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.310" style="s2">because your eyes are open in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.850" end="00:06:00.350" style="s2">different way okay well that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.310" end="00:06:03.260" style="s2">reasonable so they open their eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.350" end="00:06:05.630" style="s2">bang they know they&#39;re naked now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.260" end="00:06:08.330" style="s2">an interesting juxtaposition okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.630" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">let&#39;s say you develop a higher form of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.330" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">consciousness and that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">self-conscious so there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:15.560" style="s2">happening here there&#39;s an elevation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:16.760" style="s2">consciousness but out of that spraying</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:18.290" style="s2">self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.760" end="00:06:20.830" style="s2">and then you got to think what a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.290" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">self-consciousness mean exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.830" end="00:06:25.370" style="s2">well because you&#39;re not fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">self-conscious and the reason you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.370" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">fully self-consciousness because you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know everything about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:32.540" style="s2">right so you&#39;re you&#39;re ignorant of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.680" end="00:06:33.800" style="s2">of your own being but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.540" end="00:06:35.960" style="s2">you&#39;re being you&#39;re not ignorant about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.800" end="00:06:38.810" style="s2">well eh you can identify yourself as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.960" end="00:06:40.460" style="s2">individual so you&#39;ve got the identify</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.810" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">yourself in the mirror trick down which</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.460" end="00:06:43.700" style="s2">is kind of a standard trick for animal</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:45.410" style="s2">self-consciousness but that&#39;s only the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.700" end="00:06:49.070" style="s2">beginning it&#39;s the bare beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.410" end="00:06:50.450" style="s2">self-consciousness if you&#39;re so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.070" end="00:06:52.250" style="s2">you&#39;re self-conscious you know where</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.450" end="00:06:53.660" style="s2">your boundaries are because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.250" end="00:06:55.760" style="s2">inside the boundary is you and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.660" end="00:06:57.710" style="s2">outside isn&#39;t you but then there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.760" end="00:07:00.530" style="s2">boundaries that you have there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.710" end="00:07:01.760" style="s2">temporal boundary there&#39;s there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.530" end="00:07:03.920" style="s2">time when you weren&#39;t and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.760" end="00:07:05.690" style="s2">time when you won&#39;t be and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.920" end="00:07:07.640" style="s2">boundary in space but there&#39;s about a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.690" end="00:07:09.050" style="s2">boundary in time and that means that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.640" end="00:07:11.690" style="s2">soon as you become self conscious you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.050" end="00:07:13.700" style="s2">know that you&#39;re going to die and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.690" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">that&#39;s the tight link between the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.700" end="00:07:17.780" style="s2">of the tree of knowledge of good and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:20.810" style="s2">evil and the and death in the Old</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.780" end="00:07:22.100" style="s2">Testament or in the Genesis story so and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.810" end="00:07:26.870" style="s2">you might say while you were going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.100" end="00:07:28.550" style="s2">die before and fair enough but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.870" end="00:07:30.590" style="s2">big difference between the death the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.550" end="00:07:33.950" style="s2">death of a self conscious entity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.590" end="00:07:36.650" style="s2">death in the one case it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.950" end="00:07:38.210" style="s2">process that know that that&#39;s natural</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.650" end="00:07:41.660" style="s2">death let&#39;s say and the other one except</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.210" end="00:07:43.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a catastrophe of being for the self</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.660" end="00:07:45.290" style="s2">conscious individual you know and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.970" end="00:07:47.150" style="s2">other thing that happens is in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.290" end="00:07:49.820" style="s2">Genesis story that that discovery is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.150" end="00:07:51.650" style="s2">portrayed as a permanent rift in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.820" end="00:07:53.600" style="s2">structure of being that&#39;s why it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:07:55.370" style="s2">a deep sin it&#39;s like all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.600" end="00:07:57.230" style="s2">everything is different and it will</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.370" end="00:07:59.720" style="s2">never be the same again no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.230" end="00:08:01.700" style="s2">happens you know when you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.720" end="00:08:03.710" style="s2">obviously God was an enemy of higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.700" end="00:08:05.420" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s like well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.710" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">lots of interpretations of Genesis that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.420" end="00:08:08.840" style="s2">took exactly that stat said well God was</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">an enemy of higher self higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.840" end="00:08:13.370" style="s2">consciousness he wanted things to remain</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:16.820" style="s2">in an unconscious paradise and that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.370" end="00:08:19.100" style="s2">was human unwillingness to behave and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.820" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">curiosity that God has sent to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.100" end="00:08:23.270" style="s2">problem that were in and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">actually a catastrophe you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.270" end="00:08:28.130" style="s2">other people who were sort of hired that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:29.690" style="s2">had more say admiration for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.130" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">illumination and self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.690" end="00:08:34.190" style="s2">element said that the thing that tempted</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.930" style="s2">human beings was a greater God than the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.190" end="00:08:38.810" style="s2">God that originally did the creation</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.930" end="00:08:42.280" style="s2">that was a Gnostic idea you know so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.810" end="00:08:44.960" style="s2">serpent there becomes a an agent of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.280" end="00:08:46.670" style="s2">Revelation in a sense you know but</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.960" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">anyways this they&#39;ve laid out the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.670" end="00:08:50.030" style="s2">problem this is the problems all of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:51.830" style="s2">sudden people woke up and when they woke</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.030" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">up they noticed who they were and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.830" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">weren&#39;t happy about it so what do they</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:08:59.210" style="s2">notice they&#39;re naked okay well so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:00.860" style="s2">well you know you see so what instantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.210" end="00:09:05.510" style="s2">because the first thing they do is make</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:06.950" style="s2">fig leaves they make a you know clothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">out of fig leaves and cover themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.950" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">up well you know that&#39;s that&#39;s culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">and you think well what&#39;s good what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:17.960" style="s2">the utility of culture well that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:20.090" style="s2">culture is the barrier between us and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.960" end="00:09:22.010" style="s2">and our own nakedness it&#39;s the barrier</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.090" end="00:09:23.990" style="s2">between our nakedness and the natural</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.010" end="00:09:26.030" style="s2">world it&#39;s like why do you put on</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.990" end="00:09:27.740" style="s2">clothes so you don&#39;t freeze to death you</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.030" end="00:09:30.230" style="s2">know so that you&#39;re not as easily</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.740" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">attacked it&#39;s like as soon as you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.230" end="00:09:33.290" style="s2">you&#39;re naked and vulnerable and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:35.720" style="s2">self-conscious you extend yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.290" end="00:09:37.250" style="s2">across time you&#39;ve discovered time you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.720" end="00:09:38.930" style="s2">know that not only are you vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.250" end="00:09:40.430" style="s2">now but you&#39;re going to be vulnerable in</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.930" end="00:09:42.110" style="s2">the future it&#39;s or your children and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.430" end="00:09:44.150" style="s2">their children it&#39;s like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.110" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">nature of being it&#39;s like you&#39;ve added a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.150" end="00:09:48.650" style="s2">dimension to the nature of being you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:50.089" style="s2">added time to it and it&#39;s a radical</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.650" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">transformation you might say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.089" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">good because lions don&#39;t eat you as</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:56.450" style="s2">often it&#39;s like yeah the zebras don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.660" style="s2">seem that upset on plains of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.450" end="00:10:01.100" style="s2">Serengeti when the Lions are around</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.660" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">one&#39;s going to pick one off now and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:05.290" style="s2">but the lion the zebras aren&#39;t running</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">around you know with anxiety disorders</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.290" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">popping valium all the time because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">Lions are there but would that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">case with human beings we see a line and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">we think oh yeah some at some point that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:18.530" style="s2">line is going to want to eat one of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:20.210" style="s2">and so and lions in general will do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.530" end="00:10:22.190" style="s2">so not only do we have to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.210" end="00:10:24.230" style="s2">problem of that lion right now we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.190" end="00:10:26.510" style="s2">to solve the problem of all lions for</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.230" end="00:10:28.100" style="s2">all time which we actually seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.510" end="00:10:30.530" style="s2">doing a very good job of know as soon</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.100" end="00:10:32.030" style="s2">there won&#39;t be any of them but you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.530" end="00:10:35.740" style="s2">so that sort of thing can get out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.030" end="00:10:38.390" style="s2">hand but but you get the point so ok so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.740" end="00:10:38.940" style="s2">they they sewed fig leaves together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.390" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">they made the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:47.460" style="s2">selves aprons so you know the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:49.620" style="s2">element of it too is I think also that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.460" end="00:10:53.520" style="s2">the reason sexuality is tied in this so</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.620" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">tightly is because the most sexual parts</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.520" end="00:10:57.720" style="s2">of a human being are also the parts that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">are the most vulnerable so though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.720" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">not only you know vulnerability to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.430" end="00:11:04.380" style="s2">judgment and vulnerability to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">exploitation which is a huge deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.380" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">especially in the case of women but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.680" style="s2">also the fact that just from a purely</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:12.450" style="s2">physical perspective those are the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.680" end="00:11:14.310" style="s2">delicate tissues and so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.450" end="00:11:18.330" style="s2">they&#39;re fully exposed is really a big</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.310" end="00:11:20.460" style="s2">problem so okay so now they&#39;re naked</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.330" end="00:11:23.580" style="s2">they got aprons on it&#39;s like an you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.460" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">you they&#39;re not in unconscious paradise</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.580" end="00:11:27.330" style="s2">anymore so then what happens and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.010" style="s2">heard the voice of the Lord God walking</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.330" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">in the garden in the cool of the day and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.010" end="00:11:32.400" style="s2">Adam and his wife hid themselves from</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:36.300" style="s2">the presence of the Lord God amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.400" end="00:11:38.400" style="s2">trees of the garden I can&#39;t imagine how</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.300" end="00:11:40.440" style="s2">you could possibly pack more meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.400" end="00:11:41.820" style="s2">into two sentences you know it&#39;s you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.440" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">tell people have been at this for like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.820" end="00:11:46.680" style="s2">twenty five thousand years because see</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">what happens here is that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.680" end="00:11:50.010" style="s2">idea to begin with that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:50.670" style="s2">complete unity between God and his</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.010" end="00:11:52.380" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.670" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">let&#39;s say so that there&#39;s the natural</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.380" end="00:11:57.570" style="s2">order is undisturbed and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:12:00.690" style="s2">that&#39;s fractured and so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.570" end="00:12:03.810" style="s2">that human beings are divorced from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.690" end="00:12:07.140" style="s2">divinity and it&#39;s and not only are they</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.810" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">divorced from it they&#39;re unwilling to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.140" end="00:12:13.710" style="s2">expose themselves to it so so think</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:17.690" style="s2">about think about this I will take a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.710" end="00:12:17.690" style="s2">take a sidestep for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.390" end="00:12:32.210" style="s2">you might say well imagine that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.220" end="00:12:35.450" style="s2">could exist in a manner that was Nile</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.210" end="00:12:39.140" style="s2">and perfect the question might be well</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.450" end="00:12:40.760" style="s2">what would stop you from doing it well</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.140" end="00:12:42.710" style="s2">one thing might be that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.760" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">envision something as useless as you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.710" end="00:12:48.110" style="s2">actually managing that you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.470" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">know if you think about that what stands</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.110" end="00:12:54.290" style="s2">in the road of people as obstacles to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:56.090" style="s2">their full self-realization the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.290" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">way to encapsulate that is that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.090" end="00:13:00.140" style="s2">view themselves as inadequate now</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:01.700" style="s2">there&#39;s other things as well they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.140" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">want to take the responsibility and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.700" end="00:13:07.940" style="s2">forth but you know it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:09.700" style="s2">to heed a divine call let&#39;s say when</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.940" end="00:13:12.620" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck in this little ratty</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.700" end="00:13:15.410" style="s2">contraption that is prone to disease and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.620" end="00:13:17.450" style="s2">and prone to shame and prone to age and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.410" end="00:13:19.460" style="s2">prone to death and it&#39;s like how can you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.450" end="00:13:20.780" style="s2">continue in some divine manner when</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.460" end="00:13:22.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve come to the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.780" end="00:13:25.070" style="s2">there you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.280" end="00:13:27.020" style="s2">you know and people certainly people</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.070" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">derive the conclusion fairly frequently</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.020" end="00:13:31.490" style="s2">that they&#39;re so appalling that it would</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:34.040" style="s2">be better if they were obliterated along</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.490" end="00:13:35.780" style="s2">with everyone else it&#39;s not as if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.040" end="00:13:38.060" style="s2">realization of the nature of our own</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.780" end="00:13:41.390" style="s2">physical belly being was something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.060" end="00:13:42.980" style="s2">freed people up to be courageous you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.390" end="00:13:44.660" style="s2">know it was quite the reverse although I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.980" end="00:13:46.370" style="s2">think people can still be courageous in</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.660" end="00:13:49.250" style="s2">front of it in spite of it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.370" end="00:13:51.710" style="s2">definitely in spite of it you know all</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.250" end="00:13:53.540" style="s2">the classic definitions of true courage</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.710" end="00:13:55.670" style="s2">aren&#39;t that you&#39;re not afraid it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.540" end="00:13:58.340" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid but you do it anyways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.670" end="00:14:00.110" style="s2">like well you that fear is its and shame</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.340" end="00:14:02.210" style="s2">is an integral part of you as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.110" end="00:14:04.460" style="s2">you realize that you&#39;re vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.210" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">social evaluation and natural</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.460" end="00:14:08.660" style="s2">degeneration you&#39;re stuck with it and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">then bang you&#39;re divorced from your</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.660" end="00:14:12.350" style="s2">divine mode of being will say partly at</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.270" end="00:14:14.270" style="s2">least because you&#39;re just afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.350" end="00:14:15.910" style="s2">manifest it so anyways that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.270" end="00:14:17.660" style="s2">happens so Adam and Eve hide from God</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.910" end="00:14:19.160" style="s2">now that seems to be really</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.660" end="00:14:20.900" style="s2">counterproductive because you might</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.160" end="00:14:22.490" style="s2">think that if they didn&#39;t hide from God</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.900" end="00:14:24.140" style="s2">then there wouldn&#39;t be a problem they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.490" end="00:14:27.080" style="s2">could be naked and no problem but that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.140" end="00:14:29.030" style="s2">isn&#39;t what happens and the Lord God</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.080" end="00:14:32.180" style="s2">calls unto adamant says unto Him where</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.030" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">art where are you and Adam says I heard</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.180" end="00:14:36.440" style="s2">your voice in the garden so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:38.210" style="s2">call there and I was afraid because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.440" end="00:14:39.570" style="s2">was naked well that pretty much explains</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.210" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">it and I hid</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.570" end="00:14:45.480" style="s2">so okay and God said who told you that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:47.070" style="s2">you were naked have you eaten of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.480" end="00:14:49.529" style="s2">tree whereof I commanded thee that thou</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.070" end="00:14:51.690" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t sure does not eat who told</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.529" end="00:14:53.850" style="s2">thee that thou was naked I believe women</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.690" end="00:14:55.649" style="s2">told men that I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.850" end="00:14:58.170" style="s2">accurate summation of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.649" end="00:14:59.639" style="s2">between men and women well we develop</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.170" end="00:15:01.380" style="s2">consciousness across the span of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.639" end="00:15:02.870" style="s2">evolutionary history and I believe it</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.380" end="00:15:06.209" style="s2">for a couple of reasons number one</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.870" end="00:15:09.060" style="s2">sexual selection is a huge factor in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.209" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">what created human beings and women</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.060" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">primarily do the selection they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">bottleneck and they&#39;re the bottleneck</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:17.550" style="s2">because women can&#39;t have that many</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:19.110" style="s2">offspring they can only have a few so</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.550" end="00:15:22.290" style="s2">that makes them the bottleneck by</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.110" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">definition and women are so choosy about</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.290" end="00:15:27.810" style="s2">men that twice as many women have</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:30.600" style="s2">children as men okay so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.810" end="00:15:32.940" style="s2">is on average means that I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.600" end="00:15:35.209" style="s2">kind of hard to understand but imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.940" end="00:15:37.980" style="s2">every single woman has one child and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.209" end="00:15:41.160" style="s2">then imagine half the men have zero and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.980" end="00:15:45.449" style="s2">half of them have two okay that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.160" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">case so statistically speaking half man</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.449" end="00:15:48.990" style="s2">half of all men were right offs now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:51.540" style="s2">actually worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.990" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">because some men have so many offspring</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.540" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">that is not even funny you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">cuts it you know it cuts the number of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:03.089" style="s2">successful men down by many so women are</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:06.540" style="s2">a bottleneck and they do judge men and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.089" end="00:16:08.550" style="s2">rightly so and they judge them according</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.540" end="00:16:11.010" style="s2">to their insufficiency and that is what</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.550" end="00:16:12.149" style="s2">makes men self-conscious obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.010" end="00:16:14.279" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that makes them more</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.149" end="00:16:16.829" style="s2">self-conscious than anything else now to</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.279" end="00:16:19.529" style="s2">men&#39;s credit let me tell you about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.829" end="00:16:21.350" style="s2">bowerbirds okay so bowerbirds they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.529" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">very cool they live on the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.350" end="00:16:26.339" style="s2">the male&#39;s make these incredibly first</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.649" style="s2">of all they leave a nest that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.339" end="00:16:30.630" style="s2">like a hammock it&#39;s real soft and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.649" end="00:16:31.980" style="s2">hang that into tree and then they sweep</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.630" end="00:16:33.870" style="s2">out their front yard and then they</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.980" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">decorate it with bits of like the blue</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.870" end="00:16:36.269" style="s2">leaves are over here and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:38.310" style="s2">some red leaves here there&#39;s a nice</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.269" end="00:16:39.689" style="s2">display of green here maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.310" end="00:16:42.360" style="s2">glass there it&#39;s like this little</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.689" end="00:16:44.730" style="s2">artwork you know and the bower birds</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.360" end="00:16:46.199" style="s2">have these more or less in a row say in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.730" end="00:16:47.610" style="s2">the same territory and then the females</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.199" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">come hopping along and they take a look</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.610" end="00:16:51.939" style="s2">at this thing and if they like it well</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:53.619" style="s2">then they&#39;re willing to become a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.939" end="00:16:56.470" style="s2">friendly with that particular bowerbird</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.619" end="00:16:58.569" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t they fly away well so</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.470" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">if the male bowerbird has three female</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.569" end="00:17:02.319" style="s2">visitors and nothing pans out then he</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">you know he has a little fit and erases</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.319" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">his old creation then he has to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:07.720" style="s2">another one</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:09.370" style="s2">and so like he just have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:12.039" style="s2">that for 15 minutes and it pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.370" end="00:17:14.709" style="s2">explains human beings it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.039" end="00:17:16.899" style="s2">men one response that man could have had</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.709" end="00:17:18.759" style="s2">was just to go hide in a shell and some</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.899" end="00:17:20.500" style="s2">of them do that that is absolutely a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.759" end="00:17:21.909" style="s2">common response and to never come out</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.500" end="00:17:23.799" style="s2">and spend the rest of the lives playing</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.909" end="00:17:26.169" style="s2">video games in the basement and eating</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.799" end="00:17:28.299" style="s2">Cheetos you know but then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.169" end="00:17:30.039" style="s2">other response is well I better</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.299" end="00:17:32.710" style="s2">transform myself into something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.039" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to produce that response and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.710" end="00:17:37.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a central part of that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:40.450" style="s2">central part of male motivation it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.570" end="00:17:42.309" style="s2">central element of male motivation so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.450" end="00:17:44.289" style="s2">you&#39;re ever wondering why men are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.309" end="00:17:45.850" style="s2">way they are that real answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.289" end="00:17:48.639" style="s2">because that&#39;s how they evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.850" end="00:17:50.019" style="s2">impress women so because obviously if</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.639" end="00:17:51.940" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t have happened given that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.019" end="00:17:54.429" style="s2">sexual selection is such a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.940" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">selecting force among human beings well</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.429" end="00:17:59.409" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t have worked out so men women</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.799" end="00:18:01.419" style="s2">did make men self-conscious you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.409" end="00:18:02.649" style="s2">when it&#39;s more than that - because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.419" end="00:18:05.740" style="s2">could see a positive feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.649" end="00:18:07.870" style="s2">emerging as we got more cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.740" end="00:18:09.129" style="s2">sophisticated you know and you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.870" end="00:18:11.710" style="s2">think of that maybe that was an arms</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.129" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">race between men women and snakes</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.710" end="00:18:17.259" style="s2">something like that you know as we got</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:18.759" style="s2">more cognitively sophisticated one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.259" end="00:18:20.740" style="s2">the prices we paid for that was that our</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.759" end="00:18:22.870" style="s2">head expanded and one of the prices</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.740" end="00:18:25.330" style="s2">women paid for that was that childbirth</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.870" end="00:18:27.250" style="s2">became increasingly difficult and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.330" end="00:18:29.559" style="s2">babies kept getting born younger and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.250" end="00:18:32.100" style="s2">that meant that women became more as we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.559" end="00:18:34.389" style="s2">became more cognitively able</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.100" end="00:18:36.399" style="s2">paradoxically women became more</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.389" end="00:18:37.419" style="s2">vulnerable at certain key points of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.399" end="00:18:40.600" style="s2">their lives because they had</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.419" end="00:18:42.759" style="s2">increasingly fragile babies now how do</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.600" end="00:18:45.759" style="s2">women deal with that well I think they</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.759" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">shamed men into becoming caregivers of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.759" end="00:18:50.470" style="s2">children because how else would it have</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:53.080" style="s2">happened like the typical MIT mammal</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.470" end="00:18:53.350" style="s2">male doesn&#39;t hang around provisioning</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.639" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">are son exception to this you know there</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.889" end="00:19:05.470" style="s2">are animals that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:08.050" style="s2">an exception it happens in other species</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.470" end="00:19:10.179" style="s2">other than human beings but human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.050" end="00:19:11.920" style="s2">have this incredibly long period of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.179" end="00:19:14.290" style="s2">dependence that also requires a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.920" end="00:19:15.910" style="s2">relationship for that relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.290" end="00:19:17.800" style="s2">the remain intact there has to be a fair</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.910" end="00:19:19.570" style="s2">bit of integrity in the communication</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.800" end="00:19:23.850" style="s2">between the partners so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.570" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">moral demand there as well so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.850" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">Adam doesn&#39;t show himself here as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:29.740" style="s2">particularly courageous individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:32.410" style="s2">because which i think is quite comical</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.740" end="00:19:34.270" style="s2">when god says hope who told you that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.410" end="00:19:36.220" style="s2">were naked had you know have you eaten</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.270" end="00:19:39.700" style="s2">of that tree which I told you not to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.220" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">man says the woman ha who you gave to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.700" end="00:19:44.410" style="s2">she gave me the tree of the tree and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">did eat which is like doesn&#39;t say much</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.410" end="00:19:48.280" style="s2">for his moral territory because he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:52.570" style="s2">answer out the first chance he gets so</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.280" end="00:19:54.190" style="s2">which I also think isn&#39;t like the comedy</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.570" end="00:19:56.740" style="s2">of that is underrated in this story</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.190" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a very funny sequence of events</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.740" end="00:20:03.970" style="s2">so and so the God talks to the woman who</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:05.380" style="s2">says well what&#39;s this that you did and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.970" end="00:20:06.820" style="s2">the woman said well the serpent it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.380" end="00:20:11.490" style="s2">the Serpent&#39;s fault the serpent beguiled</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.820" end="00:20:13.420" style="s2">me and I did eat let me show you up I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.490" end="00:20:15.070" style="s2">think I&#39;ve showed you this picture</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.420" end="00:20:18.300" style="s2">before but it&#39;s such a crazily cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.070" end="00:20:18.300" style="s2">picture I want to show it to you again</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.590" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">okay well for whatever reason this disk</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.870" end="00:20:39.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be working so I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">you about the picture instead it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.960" end="00:20:43.800" style="s2">very common representation in Christian</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.020" style="s2">iconography and what it basically shows</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.800" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">is that Mary is holding up this infant</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.020" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">you know up off the ground she&#39;s got her</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:53.100" style="s2">foot on a snake or lizard it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:54.690" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take a biological genius to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.100" end="00:20:56.730" style="s2">figure out what that means it means like</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.690" end="00:20:59.220" style="s2">the good mother keeps the baby away from</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:01.140" style="s2">predatory reptiles you know and so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.220" end="00:21:03.270" style="s2">can see that as part of this feedback</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.140" end="00:21:05.400" style="s2">loop that develops so there&#39;s predation</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.270" end="00:21:06.840" style="s2">it&#39;s particularly focused on women and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.400" end="00:21:10.530" style="s2">children which is exactly what it would</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.840" end="00:21:12.990" style="s2">be focused on so and then in order for</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.530" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">that to not be to not be catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.990" end="00:21:16.410" style="s2">then the women are appealing to the men</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">for protection and that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.410" end="00:21:19.320" style="s2">increase because the women get more</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:20.850" style="s2">vulnerable as we get smarter and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.320" end="00:21:24.210" style="s2">babies get smaller and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.850" end="00:21:26.820" style="s2">triadic positive feedback loop that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.210" end="00:21:29.490" style="s2">occurs that wraps up brain development</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.820" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">and we need it there has to be a reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.490" end="00:21:32.730" style="s2">for the brain development it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">called a Baldwin effect by the way in</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.730" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">biology the Baldwin effect is where</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:39.570" style="s2">something happens to produce an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:41.370" style="s2">something biological happens that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.570" end="00:21:43.110" style="s2">produces a cultural outcome that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.370" end="00:21:45.480" style="s2">increases the probability that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.110" end="00:21:49.170" style="s2">biological adaptation will serve</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.480" end="00:21:51.570" style="s2">sickness so for example beavers cut down</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.170" end="00:21:53.700" style="s2">trees so and what that means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.570" end="00:21:56.070" style="s2">beavers that are more adapted to aquatic</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.700" end="00:21:57.900" style="s2">environments do better so as the beavers</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.070" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">get more adapted to aquatic environments</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.900" end="00:22:00.750" style="s2">and cutting down trees they cut down</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">more trees and make more aquatic</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.750" end="00:22:04.590" style="s2">environments and so the thing spins</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:06.540" style="s2">until you get a animal that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.590" end="00:22:09.450" style="s2">really well adapted to doing precisely</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.540" end="00:22:11.700" style="s2">that well something happened to blow our</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.450" end="00:22:13.800" style="s2">cortex up in very very short order and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.700" end="00:22:16.110" style="s2">it was shorter you know it was so short</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.800" end="00:22:18.570" style="s2">that the human female pelvic structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.110" end="00:22:20.940" style="s2">could barely keep up which is why birth</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.570" end="00:22:22.680" style="s2">is so rough and why so many children</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.940" end="00:22:24.330" style="s2">died in childbirth I mean it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.680" end="00:22:27.810" style="s2">have much anymore but God it used to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.330" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">happen a lot you know before the middle</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.810" end="00:22:30.030" style="s2">of the 20th century women were dying in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.580" end="00:22:32.160" style="s2">childbirth</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.030" end="00:22:34.740" style="s2">all the time plus it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.160" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">difficult so even though the baby is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.740" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">born premature for all intents and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:41.010" style="s2">purposes it&#39;s still hell and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.780" style="s2">for that is the head is so big and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.010" end="00:22:44.700" style="s2">even compressible because the baby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.780" end="00:22:47.190" style="s2">head isn&#39;t fully formed when it&#39;s born</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.700" end="00:22:47.820" style="s2">bones have gaps in them so the baby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.190" end="00:22:57.060" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.820" end="00:22:58.590" style="s2">and like like mad visibly so so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.060" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">women says well it was the Serpent&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.590" end="00:23:03.870" style="s2">fault so you know and you could almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">you could also say this ties into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.870" end="00:23:07.950" style="s2">issue of woman induced</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:10.200" style="s2">self-consciousness among men it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.950" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">if the woman&#39;s primary primary problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.200" end="00:23:15.300" style="s2">is predation you know for her and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:16.650" style="s2">infant because of her you know being</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.300" end="00:23:18.330" style="s2">burdened with the infants and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.650" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">infant&#39;s complete and absolute inability</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.330" end="00:23:22.680" style="s2">to defend itself then it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">drive the probability that she&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.680" end="00:23:27.300" style="s2">to select someone for a partner who can</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:29.130" style="s2">get rid of the damn snakes and then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.300" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">know you see that echoed over and over</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.130" end="00:23:32.430" style="s2">and human iPhoneography it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:34.470" style="s2">hero is the person who confronts the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.430" end="00:23:35.850" style="s2">dragon okay well what do you do when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.470" end="00:23:37.500" style="s2">confront a dragon you get the girl</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.850" end="00:23:39.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing but more</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.500" end="00:23:42.390" style="s2">importantly you get something of value</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.150" end="00:23:43.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s a real transmutation it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.390" end="00:23:46.260" style="s2">interesting because what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.890" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">not only did we figure out how to defend</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.260" end="00:23:51.390" style="s2">ourselves against predators we figured</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:53.790" style="s2">out that going after them voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.390" end="00:23:56.250" style="s2">was unbelievably useful because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.790" end="00:23:59.850" style="s2">might ask what the hell transformed you</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.250" end="00:24:02.430" style="s2">know frugivores and into carnivores it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.850" end="00:24:04.410" style="s2">a you know chimps will eat and they do</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.430" end="00:24:06.360" style="s2">hunt they will eat monkeys but they</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.410" end="00:24:07.500" style="s2">primarily live on leaves which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.360" end="00:24:10.470" style="s2">pointless you know because the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.500" end="00:24:12.600" style="s2">have no calories whatsoever well human</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.470" end="00:24:14.040" style="s2">beings like we got transformed we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.600" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">primarily fruit eaters and we turned</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.040" end="00:24:18.180" style="s2">into hunters and we&#39;re thin and fast</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.690" style="s2">which is very unlike a chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.180" end="00:24:23.910" style="s2">so not only where women selecting men</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.690" end="00:24:27.630" style="s2">who were able and willing to protect</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.910" end="00:24:29.820" style="s2">themselves against predators but that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.630" end="00:24:32.370" style="s2">you know got translated even farther</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.820" end="00:24:35.400" style="s2">into selection for for partners who</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.370" end="00:24:37.230" style="s2">would go out partly to protect and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:40.980" style="s2">partly also to hunt to bring something</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.230" end="00:24:42.570" style="s2">back so it always Perdita knits a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.980" end="00:24:44.580" style="s2">smart arrangement all things considered</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.570" end="00:24:46.260" style="s2">but the problem is you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.580" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">prices that women pay for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.260" end="00:24:49.830" style="s2">they&#39;re partly selecting for male</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:51.180" style="s2">aggression you know because the males</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.830" end="00:24:52.470" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to go up they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.180" end="00:24:55.110" style="s2">to be able to do that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.470" end="00:24:56.840" style="s2">unless they&#39;re tough and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.110" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">going to go out and do it unless there</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.840" end="00:25:01.700" style="s2">relatively fearless so you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:03.890" style="s2">you end up with a you got this weird</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.700" end="00:25:05.510" style="s2">balance between needing a semi predator</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.890" end="00:25:06.890" style="s2">and needing someone who&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.510" end="00:25:08.690" style="s2">able to integrate themselves into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.890" end="00:25:10.940" style="s2">household so that&#39;s the beauty and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.690" end="00:25:14.990" style="s2">beast&#39; thing as far as I can tell so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.940" end="00:25:17.179" style="s2">okay so the look god says to the serpent</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.990" end="00:25:19.400" style="s2">because you&#39;ve done this you&#39;re cursed</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.179" end="00:25:22.190" style="s2">above all cattle cattle were generally</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.400" end="00:25:24.230" style="s2">the animals and above every beast of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.190" end="00:25:25.730" style="s2">field upon thy belly you will go and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.230" end="00:25:27.470" style="s2">dust you will eat all the days of your</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.730" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">life okay so the Serpent&#39;s got your</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.470" end="00:25:34.549" style="s2">problem there and interesting to find</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:37.220" style="s2">out exactly why those damn things lost</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.549" end="00:25:39.529" style="s2">their legs because you know that snakes</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.220" end="00:25:42.200" style="s2">snake lizards aren&#39;t snakes that grew</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.529" end="00:25:44.299" style="s2">legs snakes are lizards that lost their</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.200" end="00:25:45.980" style="s2">legs the question is why did the hell</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.299" end="00:25:47.419" style="s2">did they lose their legs like what was</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.980" end="00:25:49.010" style="s2">it about the specifics of their</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.419" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">environment and their diet and their</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.010" end="00:25:54.020" style="s2">locale that meant that legless movement</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.460" style="s2">was better well they&#39;re sneakier you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.020" end="00:25:57.230" style="s2">know they can slither through the grass</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.460" end="00:25:59.809" style="s2">they can climb trees too although</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.230" end="00:26:01.789" style="s2">Gowanus do that but I don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.809" end="00:26:04.549" style="s2">about snakes to know exactly why it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.789" end="00:26:06.500" style="s2">that they lost their legs but be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.549" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">interesting to find out and unto the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.500" end="00:26:10.580" style="s2">woman and I&#39;ll put enmity between though</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:12.289" style="s2">and the woman and between hers by seed</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.580" end="00:26:14.270" style="s2">and her seed it shall bruise thy head</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.289" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">and thou shalt bruise his heel okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just another representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s going to be enmity</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:23.570" style="s2">between human beings and predatory will</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">say predatory reptiles unto the woman he</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.570" end="00:26:27.649" style="s2">said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:29.539" style="s2">and thy conception that&#39;s not hard to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.649" end="00:26:31.970" style="s2">figure out in sorrow shalt thou bring</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.539" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">forth children and thy desire shall be</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.970" end="00:26:38.120" style="s2">to thy husband and he shall rule over</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">thee notice that doesn&#39;t say should it</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.120" end="00:26:42.520" style="s2">just says she&#39;ll and that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:46.549" style="s2">thing at all remember this is a curse</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.520" end="00:26:48.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a proposition about</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.549" end="00:26:49.730" style="s2">how the world should be optimally</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.200" end="00:26:51.230" style="s2">structured it&#39;s far different than that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.730" end="00:26:52.370" style="s2">it says look there&#39;s been a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.230" end="00:26:53.080" style="s2">events and this is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.370" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">outcome</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.080" end="00:26:57.140" style="s2">childbirth is going to be hell it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:59.510" style="s2">going to be really difficult to raise</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.140" end="00:27:01.580" style="s2">children and you&#39;re going to be subject</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.510" end="00:27:03.260" style="s2">to the oppression of men it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.580" end="00:27:05.929" style="s2">well that&#39;s definitely what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.260" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">then Dante atomy says because you listen</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.929" end="00:27:08.630" style="s2">to your wife and ate of the tree which I</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">told you not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.630" end="00:27:13.190" style="s2">the grounds cursed for your sake you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:16.280" style="s2">eat it in sorrow all the days of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.190" end="00:27:19.400" style="s2">life it&#39;ll bring up thorns and thistles</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.280" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">and you&#39;ll eat the herb of the field so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.400" end="00:27:23.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the introduction of the necessity</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.160" style="s2">of agriculture right you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.570" end="00:27:26.750" style="s2">living in a garden where things are just</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.160" end="00:27:28.610" style="s2">growing for free you&#39;re out there like</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.750" end="00:27:30.770" style="s2">digging with the stick and planting</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.610" end="00:27:33.320" style="s2">things which is work you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.770" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">think well do animals work and answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.320" end="00:27:38.750" style="s2">that is no human beings work they answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:42.380" style="s2">that is yes why do human beings work how</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.750" end="00:27:44.540" style="s2">about because we discovered time right</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.380" end="00:27:46.660" style="s2">because work means why do you work while</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.540" end="00:27:48.920" style="s2">you work for the future obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.660" end="00:27:50.330" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the future unless you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.920" end="00:27:51.590" style="s2">discover time and you don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.330" end="00:27:53.690" style="s2">the future unless you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.590" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">vulnerable so these things are tangled</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.690" end="00:27:57.680" style="s2">together so the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:27:59.960" style="s2">self-consciousness is that work life</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.680" end="00:28:03.380" style="s2">becomes work like life become suffering</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.960" end="00:28:05.480" style="s2">and work so doesn&#39;t necessarily seem</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.380" end="00:28:07.040" style="s2">like a particularly good deal in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.480" end="00:28:08.930" style="s2">sweat of valley face you shall eat bread</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.040" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">until you return to the ground for out</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.930" end="00:28:13.940" style="s2">of it you were taken for your dust and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:15.560" style="s2">unto dust you&#39;ll return and Adam called</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.940" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">his wife&#39;s name Eve because she was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.560" end="00:28:20.420" style="s2">mother of all living and add unto Adam</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:22.730" style="s2">also and to his wife did the Lord God</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.420" end="00:28:25.460" style="s2">make coats of skins and clothed them so</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.730" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">okay well you know that&#39;s certainly part</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.460" end="00:28:29.270" style="s2">of the origin of clothing especially in</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:31.490" style="s2">the colder climes right it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.270" end="00:28:33.620" style="s2">get the animal maybe it&#39;s a predator and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.490" end="00:28:36.200" style="s2">you wear it too and to begin with we</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.620" end="00:28:38.030" style="s2">lived inside of them you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.200" end="00:28:40.940" style="s2">suspect although I don&#39;t know this for</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.030" end="00:28:43.280" style="s2">sure although I know it fairly well the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.940" end="00:28:47.480" style="s2">earliest dwellings were mammoth skins</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.280" end="00:28:49.190" style="s2">with mammoth bone poles and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.480" end="00:28:50.180" style="s2">see how that might have come about right</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.190" end="00:28:51.800" style="s2">because you&#39;re out there hunting a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.180" end="00:28:54.200" style="s2">mammoth maybe you&#39;re living in a cave or</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.800" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">whatever the hell people live or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.200" end="00:28:58.610" style="s2">you made something out of you know grass</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:00.770" style="s2">Heidi and I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.610" end="00:29:02.360" style="s2">Paleolithic people were living in but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.770" end="00:29:04.310" style="s2">starts to get cold maybe the ice age</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.360" end="00:29:05.930" style="s2">starts creeping up right and so you stab</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.310" end="00:29:07.670" style="s2">yourself a nice mammoth and a storm</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.930" end="00:29:09.710" style="s2">comes up what are you going to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.670" end="00:29:11.090" style="s2">well you&#39;ve skinned it out at least in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.710" end="00:29:12.680" style="s2">principle so you could carry the meat</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.090" end="00:29:14.900" style="s2">home the logical thing to do is to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.680" end="00:29:16.460" style="s2">the hell underneath the skin and after a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.900" end="00:29:17.900" style="s2">day or two in a storm underneath a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.460" end="00:29:20.420" style="s2">rotting mammoth skin you might think</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.900" end="00:29:22.220" style="s2">well wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to like do</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.420" end="00:29:24.650" style="s2">something to the skin so that it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:26.750" style="s2">quite as intolerable to live under as it</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.650" end="00:29:29.030" style="s2">might be if that&#39;s a tent like a tent is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.750" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">skinned with bones you know and then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.030" end="00:29:34.490" style="s2">movement from that to this is well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:38.510" style="s2">a matter of degree rather than kind so</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.490" end="00:29:40.400" style="s2">and then the Lord God sent the man and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.510" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">woman or the Lord God says Behold the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.400" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">man is become as one of us to know good</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.990" end="00:29:48.230" style="s2">and evil so that&#39;s the sign of divinity</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:50.600" style="s2">to know good and evil to have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.230" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">sense and now lest he put forth his hand</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:55.909" style="s2">and take also of the tree of life and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:57.380" style="s2">eat and live forever therefore the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.909" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">God sent him forth from the Garden of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.380" end="00:30:00.679" style="s2">Eden to till the ground from whence he</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:02.299" style="s2">was taken so he drove out the man and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.679" end="00:30:03.980" style="s2">placed at the east of the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.299" end="00:30:05.630" style="s2">cherubims and a flaming sword which</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.980" end="00:30:09.289" style="s2">turned every way to keep the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.630" end="00:30:11.059" style="s2">Tree of Life well the last part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.289" end="00:30:13.940" style="s2">that&#39;s very difficult to understand you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.059" end="00:30:16.669" style="s2">know the tree of life issue so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.940" end="00:30:21.830" style="s2">there is that there&#39;s there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.669" end="00:30:25.190" style="s2">in principle a substance capable of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.830" end="00:30:28.070" style="s2">of conferring immortality but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.190" end="00:30:30.020" style="s2">have access to that and so and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.070" end="00:30:31.669" style="s2">part of the return to Eden which is also</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.020" end="00:30:34.760" style="s2">the movement towards heaven which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.669" end="00:30:36.980" style="s2">also the perfection of life is to defeat</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.760" end="00:30:38.809" style="s2">death obviously and to find the elixir</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.980" end="00:30:41.059" style="s2">of immortality which by the way was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.809" end="00:30:42.620" style="s2">goal of the entire alchemical pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.059" end="00:30:45.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s what turned into science and</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.620" end="00:30:48.230" style="s2">well what&#39;s the goal of science well</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.380" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s to make us healthy wealthy and live</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.230" end="00:30:54.110" style="s2">you know conceivably forever so you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:55.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not like people aren&#39;t continually</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.110" end="00:30:58.100" style="s2">trying to get the fruit of the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.970" end="00:31:02.390" style="s2">life now there&#39;s a lot more to it than</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.100" end="00:31:05.179" style="s2">that the ending of that but but what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.390" end="00:31:07.730" style="s2">have there is the the expulsion of human</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.179" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">beings from an unconscious paradise into</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.730" end="00:31:11.720" style="s2">history and that&#39;s exactly how the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:13.880" style="s2">is structured like what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.720" end="00:31:15.110" style="s2">there&#39;s these stories in Genesis that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.880" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">are very very old</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.110" end="00:31:19.340" style="s2">there&#39;s the these stories there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:23.870" style="s2">story of Cain and Abel there&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.340" end="00:31:27.409" style="s2">of Babel of the Tower of Babel there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.870" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">the story of Noah then roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.409" end="00:31:31.070" style="s2">although it happens a bit with Noah</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:33.620" style="s2">history starts because then when you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.070" end="00:31:34.770" style="s2">past that you get to the post-flood</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.620" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.770" end="00:31:39.300" style="s2">like the pre-flood period is so back in</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:41.640" style="s2">prehistory that it&#39;s all archaic</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.300" end="00:31:43.290" style="s2">mythology and the post-flood period</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.640" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">which basically starts with Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.290" end="00:31:47.280" style="s2">starts to become a history of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:51.090" style="s2">culture of Israel so it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.280" end="00:31:53.310" style="s2">actually literally it&#39;s the history of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.090" end="00:31:55.560" style="s2">culture instead of the mythologies ation</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.310" end="00:32:01.770" style="s2">of the you know radical prehistory of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.560" end="00:32:04.860" style="s2">the past so you know I think I&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.770" end="00:32:06.180" style="s2">just tell you briefly the Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.860" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2">story because we&#39;re there we might as</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.180" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2">well do it and this is this story is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.580" end="00:32:21.180" style="s2">roughly speaking 12 sentences long so</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.730" end="00:32:26.280" style="s2">okay so adamant and he have a child Cain</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.180" end="00:32:27.960" style="s2">and AD and Eve says I have gotten a man</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.280" end="00:32:30.210" style="s2">from the Lord and again she bought her</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.960" end="00:32:31.980" style="s2">his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.210" end="00:32:34.260" style="s2">of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.980" end="00:32:37.020" style="s2">ground so there&#39;s some antagonism here</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.260" end="00:32:38.700" style="s2">between the the Shepherds and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.020" end="00:32:40.260" style="s2">farmers and that&#39;s like there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.700" end="00:32:42.120" style="s2">antagonism between shepherds and farmers</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.260" end="00:32:44.940" style="s2">because the Shepherd&#39;s want the sheep to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.120" end="00:32:46.410" style="s2">graze all over the place and the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.940" end="00:32:49.620" style="s2">want the shape to stay the hell out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.410" end="00:32:51.150" style="s2">the out of the fields you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.620" end="00:32:54.090" style="s2">was all played out again in the American</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.150" end="00:32:55.620" style="s2">West there was huge you know conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.090" end="00:32:59.160" style="s2">between the farmers and the ranchers for</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.620" end="00:33:01.140" style="s2">exactly the same reason so and it came</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.160" end="00:33:02.940" style="s2">in process of time it came to pass that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.140" end="00:33:05.220" style="s2">Cain brought of the fruit of the ground</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.940" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">an offering unto the Lord all right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.220" end="00:33:08.490" style="s2">this is a strange thing so we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:11.580" style="s2">talked about the discovery of time and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.490" end="00:33:13.580" style="s2">the necessity for work okay so you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.580" end="00:33:15.900" style="s2">we don&#39;t exactly know how people</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.580" end="00:33:17.310" style="s2">conceptualized of those ideas it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.900" end="00:33:18.450" style="s2">like they were cavemen or all sitting</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.310" end="00:33:20.070" style="s2">around the fire one day and they said</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.450" end="00:33:21.900" style="s2">hey you know what I just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.070" end="00:33:23.370" style="s2">tomorrow we should do something about</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.900" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">that we should get to work it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.370" end="00:33:28.020" style="s2">thought only knows how that happened it</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:30.030" style="s2">came out of the inarticulate biological</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.020" end="00:33:32.310" style="s2">substructure that is our past and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.030" end="00:33:34.200" style="s2">started to manifest itself god only</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.310" end="00:33:36.270" style="s2">knows in imaginative ideas but one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.200" end="00:33:38.040" style="s2">those imaginative ideas is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.270" end="00:33:40.350" style="s2">the sacrifice you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.040" end="00:33:42.840" style="s2">conceptualization of God the Father as</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.350" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">that which extends across time and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.840" end="00:33:46.760" style="s2">judges then you make sacrificial</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:49.580" style="s2">offerings to that which</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.760" end="00:33:50.900" style="s2">which could be of your labor this is of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.580" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">the fruits of your labor but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.900" end="00:33:55.040" style="s2">difference is trivial it&#39;s like look</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:56.900" style="s2">what I&#39;ve done is this good enough for</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.040" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">you and believe me you guys are asking</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.900" end="00:34:01.520" style="s2">that question all the time it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:03.650" style="s2">it&#39;s just non-stop is this good enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.520" end="00:34:05.450" style="s2">is this good enough is this sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.650" end="00:34:06.650" style="s2">enough you know and what are you hoping</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.450" end="00:34:08.870" style="s2">for while you&#39;re hoping for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.650" end="00:34:10.310" style="s2">blessings of well I would say for all</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.870" end="00:34:12.410" style="s2">intents and purposes you&#39;re hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.310" end="00:34:14.150" style="s2">the blessings of God the Father now you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.410" end="00:34:16.970" style="s2">might think about it pure cultural terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.150" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">that&#39;s fine from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.970" end="00:34:20.210" style="s2">perspective it hardly makes any</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:23.630" style="s2">difference at all the point is is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.210" end="00:34:26.510" style="s2">to conceptualize culture across time as</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.630" end="00:34:29.480" style="s2">a judgmental male is a really smart idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.510" end="00:34:31.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a really really smart idea so and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.480" end="00:34:33.530" style="s2">then it&#39;s a judgmental male that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.640" end="00:34:35.600" style="s2">have to make offerings to it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.530" end="00:34:37.820" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty much exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.600" end="00:34:39.230" style="s2">right okay so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.820" end="00:34:43.100" style="s2">and so people are acting this out you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.230" end="00:34:45.670" style="s2">have to make sacrifices Cain brings some</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.100" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">you know vegetables and fruit and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.670" end="00:34:50.690" style="s2">Abel brings not he brings like some</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:54.650" style="s2">lambs and these are as a high quality</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.690" end="00:34:57.470" style="s2">Lambs right there the choice cuts and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.650" end="00:35:01.220" style="s2">know that partly because the first linge</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.470" end="00:35:04.340" style="s2">of the flock so that&#39;s the firstborn say</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.220" end="00:35:07.010" style="s2">lambs there there they had a reputation</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.340" end="00:35:08.660" style="s2">as the most valuable and partly because</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.010" end="00:35:11.000" style="s2">the firstborn son was the most valuable</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.660" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the same kind of idea and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.000" end="00:35:14.420" style="s2">reason the firstborn son was most</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">valuable and part of the reason is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.420" end="00:35:19.580" style="s2">that unless you give all your land to</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:21.890" style="s2">one of your children by 12 generations</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.580" end="00:35:23.330" style="s2">all of your offspring are living on</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.890" end="00:35:25.700" style="s2">something the size of a postage stamp</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.330" end="00:35:27.890" style="s2">and they&#39;re all starving to death</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.700" end="00:35:30.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s unfair in a sense that it only</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.890" end="00:35:33.320" style="s2">goes to the firstborn son but if it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.200" end="00:35:35.090" style="s2">agricultural community there&#39;s no better</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.320" end="00:35:37.880" style="s2">solution and then at least you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.090" end="00:35:39.620" style="s2">your second born son like well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.880" end="00:35:41.210" style="s2">you&#39;re a fine guy and you know it would</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.620" end="00:35:43.490" style="s2">be wonderful if you could get something</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.210" end="00:35:45.650" style="s2">but you don&#39;t get it and it&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.490" end="00:35:47.690" style="s2">fault it&#39;s not my fault either it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.650" end="00:35:48.980" style="s2">that&#39;s just the rule and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.690" end="00:35:50.630" style="s2">good deal for everybody you know you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.980" end="00:35:51.940" style="s2">don&#39;t get the farm you have to go make</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.630" end="00:35:54.920" style="s2">your own way but at least there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.940" end="00:35:57.380" style="s2">enmity associated with it necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.920" end="00:35:59.330" style="s2">so anyways Cain makes this offering that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.380" end="00:36:05.690" style="s2">looks like it&#39;s a Vicryl</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.330" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">and God is happy about that and the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.690" end="00:36:09.380" style="s2">had respect unto Abel and to is offering</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:11.600" style="s2">now the book the story makes this</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.380" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">ambiguous a you can kind of guess that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.600" end="00:36:15.860" style="s2">the reason that Abel gets away with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:17.810" style="s2">is because well a he&#39;s bringing meat</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.860" end="00:36:18.590" style="s2">rather than vegetables okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.810" end="00:36:21.080" style="s2">higher-quality</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.590" end="00:36:23.690" style="s2">much more much more nutrient-dense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.080" end="00:36:25.850" style="s2">much higher quality offering of food and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.690" end="00:36:28.100" style="s2">then it&#39;s also of the meat it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.850" end="00:36:29.900" style="s2">highest quality and so and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.100" end="00:36:32.450" style="s2">thing that happens is it&#39;s acceptable to</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.900" end="00:36:34.280" style="s2">God so you know it might be that Abel</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.450" end="00:36:36.050" style="s2">just got it right and God was happy or</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.280" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">maybe God&#39;s happy about Abel for some</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.050" end="00:36:41.420" style="s2">completely arbitrary reason it actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter at all you get value out</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.420" end="00:36:45.080" style="s2">of both interpretations I mean I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:47.180" style="s2">say to err on the safe side that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.080" end="00:36:50.150" style="s2">offering the most valuable things is</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.180" end="00:36:52.100" style="s2">probably your best bet but there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.150" end="00:36:54.050" style="s2">art there&#39;s an some respect for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.100" end="00:36:57.080" style="s2">arbitrary nature of God here too you</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.050" end="00:36:57.950" style="s2">can&#39;t exactly be sure why he&#39;s not happy</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.080" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">with Cain</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.950" end="00:37:02.930" style="s2">so anyways doesn&#39;t matter until Canaan</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:05.690" style="s2">is offering he had not respect and Cain</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.930" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">was very wroth angry that is and his</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.690" end="00:37:09.320" style="s2">countenance fall so like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:14.120" style="s2">permanent disappointment for him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.320" end="00:37:16.100" style="s2">angry resentful unhappy miserable all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.120" end="00:37:16.670" style="s2">those things he&#39;s failing that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.100" end="00:37:18.680" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:20.420" style="s2">fundamentally like if God isn&#39;t pleased</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.680" end="00:37:22.840" style="s2">by his offerings what happens is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.420" end="00:37:26.360" style="s2">failing and this makes him very angry</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.840" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">and then the Lord says what what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.360" end="00:37:31.670" style="s2">with you why are you angry and why is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:34.300" style="s2">your face fallen the way it has and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.670" end="00:37:36.890" style="s2">says more than this is where it gets it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.300" end="00:37:38.390" style="s2">seems the story seems to reveal that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.890" end="00:37:39.950" style="s2">this actually has something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.390" end="00:37:42.860" style="s2">Cain rather than something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.950" end="00:37:45.350" style="s2">God so God says if you do well won&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.860" end="00:37:49.610" style="s2">be accepted well that implies he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.350" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">doing well and if you don&#39;t do well then</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.610" end="00:37:55.310" style="s2">it&#39;s your fault and so God is saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:56.990" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t bring your damned problems</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.310" end="00:37:58.670" style="s2">to me bucko it&#39;s like if this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.990" end="00:38:00.920" style="s2">working out for you it&#39;s because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.670" end="00:38:02.750" style="s2">just not doing it right you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.920" end="00:38:05.240" style="s2">not into this properly you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.750" end="00:38:07.070" style="s2">well and also you&#39;re blending things</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.240" end="00:38:11.210" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be blamed now there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.070" end="00:38:13.339" style="s2">interesting part of this so the the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.210" end="00:38:14.989" style="s2">that the story sin lies at your</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.339" end="00:38:17.269" style="s2">or was told it was told in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.989" end="00:38:18.950" style="s2">metaphorical structure and sin was</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.269" end="00:38:22.369" style="s2">something that was conceptualized as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.950" end="00:38:25.729" style="s2">lustful predatory animal like a cat and</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.369" end="00:38:27.859" style="s2">so it was prowling at Cain&#39;s door that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.729" end="00:38:30.650" style="s2">the metaphor and the idea is that Cain</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.859" end="00:38:34.130" style="s2">allows this thing in to have intercourse</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.650" end="00:38:38.599" style="s2">with him so there&#39;s this participation</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.130" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">in like a sexualized merger and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.599" end="00:38:42.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an implication there</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:45.559" style="s2">and the implication is not only is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.049" end="00:38:48.229" style="s2">does sin at the door but Cain invites it</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.559" end="00:38:50.450" style="s2">in and has a creative relationship like</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.229" end="00:38:53.329" style="s2">an intimately creative relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.450" end="00:38:55.430" style="s2">it now that&#39;s ridiculously smart because</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.329" end="00:38:57.529" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens if people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.430" end="00:38:59.349" style="s2">resentful because they&#39;re offerings that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.529" end="00:39:02.569" style="s2">were either second-rate or got rejected</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.349" end="00:39:04.039" style="s2">you know one of the pathways is first</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.569" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">they get very very angry and their</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.039" end="00:39:07.549" style="s2">countenance fall so they&#39;re resentful</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:09.349" style="s2">and hostile and the next thing is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.549" end="00:39:12.950" style="s2">know the little resentful fantasy start</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.349" end="00:39:15.529" style="s2">to emerge and instead of thinking huh</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.950" end="00:39:18.170" style="s2">that&#39;s not a very productive way to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.529" end="00:39:20.210" style="s2">because it is like a door they think wow</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.170" end="00:39:22.099" style="s2">let&#39;s just see where we can go with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.210" end="00:39:23.749" style="s2">and like after five or six years of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.099" end="00:39:26.809" style="s2">you&#39;re in a prime position to go shoot</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.749" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">up Dawson College you know you can go</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.809" end="00:39:33.650" style="s2">very far down that rabbit hole and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:36.140" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly motivated by the rejection</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.650" end="00:39:37.700" style="s2">of the fruits of your being by existence</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.140" end="00:39:45.019" style="s2">that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.700" end="00:39:46.700" style="s2">so well and then so so Cain obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.019" end="00:39:48.349" style="s2">he&#39;s not happy with that response not in</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.700" end="00:39:49.940" style="s2">the least because it says exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.349" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">opposite of what he would like it to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.940" end="00:39:52.759" style="s2">you know first of all that it&#39;s his own</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:54.170" style="s2">fault that he could do something about</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.759" end="00:39:56.799" style="s2">it and then he doesn&#39;t get to blame</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.170" end="00:39:59.239" style="s2">being and God</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.799" end="00:40:01.219" style="s2">so Cain goes and has a chat with Abel</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.239" end="00:40:02.869" style="s2">and it came came to pass when they were</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.219" end="00:40:05.749" style="s2">in the field that Cain rose up against</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.869" end="00:40:07.640" style="s2">Abel his brother and killed him well the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.749" end="00:40:09.549" style="s2">first story about real human beings in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.640" end="00:40:13.339" style="s2">the Bible is a murder</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.549" end="00:40:16.789" style="s2">it&#39;s a fratricide and it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.339" end="00:40:19.039" style="s2">the antagonistic brothers one who is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.789" end="00:40:20.539" style="s2">archetype of good that&#39;s Abel the others</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.039" end="00:40:22.849" style="s2">who an archetype of evil and those</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.539" end="00:40:25.039" style="s2">develop across time it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.849" end="00:40:26.419" style="s2">echoing or a pre shadowing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.039" end="00:40:28.549" style="s2">the way of thinking about it a battle</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.419" end="00:40:32.359" style="s2">between Christ and Satan because those</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.549" end="00:40:34.069" style="s2">are more they&#39;re more purely archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.359" end="00:40:35.749" style="s2">figures and much more fleshed out but</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.069" end="00:40:38.299" style="s2">it&#39;s the earliest manifestation of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.749" end="00:40:40.039" style="s2">idea the hostile brothers and what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.299" end="00:40:43.369" style="s2">get it&#39;s so sophisticated because</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.039" end="00:40:45.759" style="s2">basically what it says is that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.369" end="00:40:48.919" style="s2">badly or you work hard either way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.759" end="00:40:50.900" style="s2">God rejects your offerings and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.919" end="00:40:52.279" style="s2">become angry and resentful the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.900" end="00:40:53.809" style="s2">thing you&#39;re going to do is go after the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.279" end="00:40:55.999" style="s2">best thing you could possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.809" end="00:40:57.499" style="s2">and do your best to wipe it out and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.999" end="00:40:59.869" style="s2">might say well why would you do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.499" end="00:41:02.239" style="s2">well there&#39;s a bunch of reasons well</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.869" end="00:41:05.059" style="s2">first of all it would feel good second</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.239" end="00:41:06.799" style="s2">you get revenge against God because of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.059" end="00:41:08.089" style="s2">course this is God&#39;s favorite so if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.799" end="00:41:09.140" style="s2">can take him out of the equation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.089" end="00:41:12.349" style="s2">like that&#39;s a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.140" end="00:41:14.660" style="s2">third the ideal against which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.349" end="00:41:16.849" style="s2">negatively contrasting yourself is now</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.660" end="00:41:19.009" style="s2">gone because that&#39;s the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.849" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">having an ideal if you have an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.009" end="00:41:24.140" style="s2">then you&#39;re unworthy and that&#39;s okay if</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:25.910" style="s2">you think the ideal is attainable or</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.140" end="00:41:27.109" style="s2">even if you can move towards it but if</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.910" end="00:41:28.939" style="s2">all of a sudden the ideal is</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.109" end="00:41:31.249" style="s2">unattainable and you&#39;re sort of cast</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.939" end="00:41:32.390" style="s2">among the Damned the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.249" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be able to view that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.390" end="00:41:38.089" style="s2">ideal as anything other than your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:40.219" style="s2">is very low and so Cain kills him so</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.089" end="00:41:41.809" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.219" end="00:41:45.289" style="s2">really means that&#39;s the end of it for</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.809" end="00:41:46.999" style="s2">Cain he&#39;s destroyed his own ideal well</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.289" end="00:41:48.619" style="s2">how do you live then how do you live if</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.999" end="00:41:49.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve destroyed your own ideal you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.619" end="00:41:51.589" style="s2">got nowhere to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.400" end="00:41:53.479" style="s2">and so Cain is so angry that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.589" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">willing to destroy his own ideal to</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.479" end="00:42:01.239" style="s2">obtain revenge and that&#39;s 12 line story</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:04.699" style="s2">right at the beginning of history and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.239" end="00:42:07.489" style="s2">that&#39;s the layout for the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.699" end="00:42:09.799" style="s2">humanity it says we became self</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.489" end="00:42:11.029" style="s2">conscious our eyes opened we became self</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.799" end="00:42:12.739" style="s2">conscious we recognized our</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.029" end="00:42:16.039" style="s2">vulnerability in an attempt to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.739" end="00:42:17.929" style="s2">that we started to work and sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.039" end="00:42:19.759" style="s2">but the problem with that is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.929" end="00:42:21.469" style="s2">that didn&#39;t work maybe because God was</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.759" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">feeling particularly arbitrary that day</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.469" end="00:42:25.939" style="s2">or because we&#39;re kind of useless either</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:28.130" style="s2">way when it doesn&#39;t work that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.939" end="00:42:31.939" style="s2">because it&#39;s our only remaining defense</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.130" end="00:42:34.249" style="s2">and so then what well then it&#39;s a choice</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.939" end="00:42:35.989" style="s2">it&#39;s more it&#39;s more choice right there</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.249" end="00:42:37.849" style="s2">between good and evil and that&#39;s all for</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.989" end="00:42:40.339" style="s2">shadowed in the first story</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.849" end="00:42:42.380" style="s2">so now I have one more thing to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.339" end="00:42:43.339" style="s2">this took me a long time to figure out I</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.380" end="00:42:44.839" style="s2">thought well what the hell is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.339" end="00:42:47.329" style="s2">connection between the knowledge of good</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.839" end="00:42:51.819" style="s2">and evil and nakedness and vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.329" end="00:42:54.589" style="s2">and an awareness and I thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.819" end="00:42:58.969" style="s2">there&#39;s predators predation and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.589" end="00:43:05.539" style="s2">evil so the lion kills the default and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.969" end="00:43:07.219" style="s2">eats it it&#39;s rough that&#39;s a tragedy but</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.539" end="00:43:09.049" style="s2">you capture an enemy and then you keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.219" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">them alive for three weeks in pain</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.049" end="00:43:14.599" style="s2">before you kill them there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:16.789" style="s2">there than tragedy that&#39;s malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.599" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">and then you might say well how is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.789" end="00:43:20.390" style="s2">that you can come up with malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:21.380" style="s2">and I would say as soon as you&#39;re self</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.390" end="00:43:23.479" style="s2">conscious you can come up with</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.380" end="00:43:25.579" style="s2">malevolence because if I know how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.479" end="00:43:27.619" style="s2">vulnerable and I know that you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.579" end="00:43:29.989" style="s2">me all I have to do is figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.619" end="00:43:33.140" style="s2">the worst possible thing would be for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.989" end="00:43:35.209" style="s2">and then I can do it to you and so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.140" end="00:43:36.619" style="s2">don&#39;t get the knowledge of self</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.209" end="00:43:40.190" style="s2">conscious vulnerability without</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.619" end="00:43:41.449" style="s2">instantly also obtaining the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.190" end="00:43:43.489" style="s2">of the difference between good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.449" end="00:43:45.349" style="s2">and that&#39;s also another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.489" end="00:43:47.089" style="s2">really distinguishes people because we</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.349" end="00:43:48.650" style="s2">can do things that are so terrible but</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.089" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">they make any of the things that animals</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.650" end="00:43:55.039" style="s2">do look positively forgivable so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:56.749" style="s2">know that long without self</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.039" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">consciousness comes this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.749" end="00:44:03.559" style="s2">widening of the capacity for action from</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:05.569" style="s2">just natural tragedy let&#39;s say this</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.559" end="00:44:07.549" style="s2">natural life to this whole spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.569" end="00:44:09.319" style="s2">the ultimate and good and the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.549" end="00:44:10.849" style="s2">and evil and then as soon as that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.319" end="00:44:13.489" style="s2">happens the first thing we have is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.849" end="00:44:15.259" style="s2">display of that in in dramatic form and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.489" end="00:44:18.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the Cain and Abel story now</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.259" end="00:44:20.329" style="s2">interestingly enough and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.140" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">last thing that I&#39;ll tell you God</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.329" end="00:44:24.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t kill Cain we can talk about why</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:29.809" style="s2">that is later but Cain has children and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.670" end="00:44:33.799" style="s2">and and Cain&#39;s descendants I think three</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.809" end="00:44:36.140" style="s2">generations down so if you kill one</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.799" end="00:44:38.479" style="s2">Akane&#39;s sons he kills seven of you they</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.140" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">kill seven of you and if you kill one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.479" end="00:44:43.579" style="s2">Cain&#39;s grandchildren then they kill 49</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">of you and then and so forth until you</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.579" end="00:44:47.299" style="s2">get to this guy named tubal Cain who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:48.680" style="s2">either the grandson or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.299" end="00:44:49.610" style="s2">great-grandson I don&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.680" end="00:44:51.620" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.610" end="00:44:55.190" style="s2">in tradition he&#39;s the first person who</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.620" end="00:44:58.550" style="s2">makes weapons of war so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.190" end="00:45:01.360" style="s2">idea that the sacrifice fails and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.550" end="00:45:04.670" style="s2">produces this descent into murderous</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.360" end="00:45:07.670" style="s2">resentment and then that can amplify</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.670" end="00:45:09.770" style="s2">across the culture and possess more and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.670" end="00:45:11.870" style="s2">more people until what happens is it</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.770" end="00:45:13.610" style="s2">finally erupts in full full-scale war</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.870" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s more than territoriality</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.610" end="00:45:18.170" style="s2">rights more than a territorial dispute</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.640" end="00:45:20.330" style="s2">because you can understand territorial</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.170" end="00:45:22.730" style="s2">disputes this is territorial dispute</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.330" end="00:45:27.350" style="s2">with malevolence and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.730" end="00:45:29.780" style="s2">something that you that doesn&#39;t need any</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.350" end="00:45:32.110" style="s2">explanation we everyone understands what</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.780" end="00:45:32.110" style="s2">that is</p>
