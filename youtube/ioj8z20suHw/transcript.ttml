<p begin="00:00:57.620" end="00:01:03.260" style="s2">about about a notion of where we in jump</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.550" end="00:01:07.490" style="s2">in Johnny&#39;s conversation talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.260" end="00:01:12.250" style="s2">one of the central part of his Tree of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.490" end="00:01:12.250" style="s2">Life his theory is the justification</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.580" end="00:01:18.950" style="s2">hypothesis basically of and we go deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.979" end="00:01:21.080" style="s2">into this but I was wanting to bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.950" end="00:01:24.409" style="s2">that into the conversation with John and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.080" end="00:01:27.820" style="s2">we talked about moving moving in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.409" end="00:01:32.840" style="s2">conversations from the courtroom to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.820" end="00:01:34.310" style="s2">the courtyard and so John and so he did</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.840" end="00:01:38.600" style="s2">this basically wrote me and said let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.310" end="00:01:42.940" style="s2">talk right so what a great guy brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.600" end="00:01:47.869" style="s2">mind radical thinker thinking so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.940" end="00:01:51.500" style="s2">about things basically revealed a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.869" end="00:01:53.149" style="s2">unified field theory of psychology which</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.500" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">is if you know anything about psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.149" end="00:01:57.619" style="s2">you know that they kind of reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:59.080" style="s2">wheel every time right so he he really</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.619" end="00:02:04.190" style="s2">got underneath there and showed</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.080" end="00:02:06.890" style="s2">basically a very deep unity or a way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.190" end="00:02:09.349" style="s2">look at things that shows how they one</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.890" end="00:02:11.390" style="s2">system involved into the next as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.349" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">complexity figure theory in there as</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.390" end="00:02:18.910" style="s2">psychodynamics it as sociology I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.170" end="00:02:22.129" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really comprehensive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.910" end="00:02:24.410" style="s2">quite innovative and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.129" end="00:02:26.569" style="s2">conversation we go deep into that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.410" end="00:02:29.410" style="s2">system and we we talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.569" end="00:02:31.819" style="s2">circling and the primacy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.410" end="00:02:33.980" style="s2">intersubjectivity and what happens there</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.819" end="00:02:35.450" style="s2">and when it goes wrong what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.980" end="00:02:37.610" style="s2">us and when it goes right what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.450" end="00:02:40.940" style="s2">to us and it was really great talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.610" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">about circling and then him bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:44.569" style="s2">terms of his system was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:48.019" style="s2">enlightening for me it was really great</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.569" end="00:02:51.010" style="s2">but also kind of just revealing how I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.019" end="00:02:54.709" style="s2">think the thing I got about this is how</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.010" end="00:02:58.790" style="s2">personal like it really is for him his</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.709" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">ideas and how risky that is to allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.790" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">something to when something like an idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">like an insight that a deep mystery</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">to bring that into the world how</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:18.050" style="s2">personal that is right so we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.690" end="00:03:21.500" style="s2">lot about that and I just really get</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.050" end="00:03:23.480" style="s2">this sense of um the deep place of love</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.500" end="00:03:27.800" style="s2">that this all comes from with him and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.480" end="00:03:29.360" style="s2">reveals and so I really enjoyed getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.800" end="00:03:32.600" style="s2">to know him and I look to have him on</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.360" end="00:03:36.890" style="s2">again and happy that he&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:38.520" style="s2">conversation all right much love the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.890" end="00:03:48.810" style="s2">bike</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.240" end="00:04:13.260" style="s2">of talk talk a bit about your work so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t familiar with it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.260" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">can get it a little bit of a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">some of the terms and stuff that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">using as we go go through some of it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">the one the one thing I notice I&#39;m I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">mean I&#39;m just really impressed with with</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:32.760" style="s2">your tree of knowledge and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:35.670" style="s2">system that you come from great and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.760" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">psychology and how you bridge so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.670" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">different things ontology epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:44.330" style="s2">all that that really I know in what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:49.230" style="s2">understand is the attempt to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.330" end="00:04:52.620" style="s2">bring unity or realize unity in a field</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.230" end="00:04:54.120" style="s2">of psychology which is like we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.620" end="00:04:56.520" style="s2">know a psychoanalytic system will</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.120" end="00:04:58.680" style="s2">reinvent the whole wheel kind of every</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.520" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">time right I mean it&#39;s just known for</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.680" end="00:05:04.410" style="s2">that right so that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:07.830" style="s2">so I know that it&#39;s so psychology as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">science is is just as riddle has</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.830" end="00:05:13.230" style="s2">additionally been riddled with like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:15.450" style="s2">lot of ambiguity right which which so</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.230" end="00:05:20.040" style="s2">just the fact that like in a very real</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.450" end="00:05:23.190" style="s2">way you were able to realize a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.040" end="00:05:26.730" style="s2">way of unifying it that that that in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.190" end="00:05:28.200" style="s2">in my view really didn&#39;t didn&#39;t level</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.730" end="00:05:30.330" style="s2">down to use the high daguerreian term</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.200" end="00:05:32.190" style="s2">like didn&#39;t level down right any of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.330" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">particulars but actually exemplified</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.190" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">right why it showed up like that right</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">and so that&#39;s just just the mind that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:43.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that thinks in that way I just</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:46.950" style="s2">have just really been impressed by and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.170" end="00:05:51.400" style="s2">appreciate a lot I feel known I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.950" end="00:05:54.370" style="s2">appreciate that intro and frame</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.400" end="00:05:55.780" style="s2">yeah I mean the I didn&#39;t it&#39;s a in</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.370" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">retrospect it&#39;s one of those things you</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.780" end="00:05:59.169" style="s2">look back on you&#39;re like gosh I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:01.330" style="s2">believe how you know that and so now I</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.169" end="00:06:04.060" style="s2">try to tell everybody so at least about</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.330" end="00:06:06.669" style="s2">the what I now call and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:10.210" style="s2">popularize the problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.669" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">yeah yeah which I really I wish we</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.210" end="00:06:14.290" style="s2">better understood because I believe and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:17.500" style="s2">obviously my life&#39;s taking me in this so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.290" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">I&#39;m biased this way but I really believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.500" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s an unbelievably important mystery</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.690" end="00:06:24.820" style="s2">for us all to be aware of yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.370" style="s2">pretty straightforward and basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.820" end="00:06:30.760" style="s2">modern science you know gets its legs</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.370" end="00:06:33.220" style="s2">and from Galileo into Newton and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.760" end="00:06:36.039" style="s2">really established in the 17th 18th</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.220" end="00:06:39.070" style="s2">century and then we decide hey we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.039" end="00:06:40.690" style="s2">apply this to human experience basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.070" end="00:06:43.030" style="s2">and you know in terms of there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.690" end="00:06:43.449" style="s2">called psychophysics and then Wilhelm</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.030" end="00:06:45.910" style="s2">wundt</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.449" end="00:06:48.280" style="s2">and then they saw they we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.910" end="00:06:50.430" style="s2">to do a modern science analysis in other</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.280" end="00:06:53.800" style="s2">words I mean it&#39;s the language some</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.430" end="00:06:55.539" style="s2">methodology the ontological epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.800" end="00:06:57.370" style="s2">not necessarily talk to us but just hey</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.539" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">how do we apply modern science to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.370" end="00:07:03.010" style="s2">thing we ever recall psychology it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:05.650" style="s2">seemed like advanced but what happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.010" end="00:07:10.919" style="s2">from 9:18 you know if we go back a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.650" end="00:07:13.479" style="s2">little bit to 1850 and by certainly 1930</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.919" end="00:07:16.660" style="s2">while this fields trying to get its legs</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.479" end="00:07:20.620" style="s2">what happens is emerges the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.660" end="00:07:23.380" style="s2">psychology we let Vygotsky nailed he</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.620" end="00:07:27.099" style="s2">called it the crisis okay back in 1920</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.380" end="00:07:29.260" style="s2">so what is it well I like to enter it by</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.099" end="00:07:31.030" style="s2">saying okay physics what&#39;s that well</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.260" end="00:07:32.789" style="s2">physics is the science of matter and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.030" end="00:07:35.979" style="s2">energy on the grid of space and time</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.789" end="00:07:38.410" style="s2">basically you know energy matter their</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.979" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">interactions are baby okay what&#39;s campus</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.410" end="00:07:42.520" style="s2">all right science of the atomic elements</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">and their behavior in a molecular form</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.520" end="00:07:51.699" style="s2">what&#39;s biology as a science of life what</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">is psychology yeah yeah and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.699" end="00:07:58.330" style="s2">well it&#39;s behavior in mental process</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:08:00.580" style="s2">okay yeah but and I bought that line I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.330" end="00:08:03.490" style="s2">thought that oh okay I think I know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.580" end="00:08:04.940" style="s2">that is and then you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.490" end="00:08:06.740" style="s2">realize when you actually know</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.940" end="00:08:08.150" style="s2">how to look for it what they then say</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.740" end="00:08:09.860" style="s2">all the textbooks right away and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.150" end="00:08:12.770" style="s2">say what what we really do is we apply</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.860" end="00:08:14.870" style="s2">the scientific method rather than folk</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.770" end="00:08:16.490" style="s2">psychology or subjective opinion which</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.870" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">makes psychology unique is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.490" end="00:08:22.970" style="s2">scientific method of behavior and mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:24.710" style="s2">process yeah okay but then you go back</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.970" end="00:08:27.530" style="s2">and what do you mean my behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.710" end="00:08:28.610" style="s2">mental processes and then no one has</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.530" end="00:08:31.780" style="s2">there&#39;s no consensus</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.610" end="00:08:33.830" style="s2">so psy clinic people and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.780" end="00:08:36.200" style="s2">psychophysical into introspection</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.830" end="00:08:37.099" style="s2">structuralist people and the game&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.200" end="00:08:40.219" style="s2">functionalist</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.099" end="00:08:42.020" style="s2">and the John Watson behaviorists and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.219" end="00:08:45.020" style="s2">then later the neo behaviorist another</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.020" end="00:08:48.020" style="s2">cognitivists ah different conceptions</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.020" end="00:08:52.070" style="s2">yeah what the center of the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.020" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">is that&#39;s amazing right amazing because</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.070" end="00:08:55.910" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case in biology people</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">have criticized me or said we&#39;ll wait a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.910" end="00:08:59.840" style="s2">minute we don&#39;t know what life is in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">biology okay it&#39;s like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.840" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">what the edges of life is yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">coronavirus alive when it sits there on</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:10.550" style="s2">the desk the question okay how many got</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">one of their plants alive and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.550" end="00:09:16.190" style="s2">so different and that biologists a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">science of life broadly defining yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:24.550" style="s2">the biologists have the center</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:24.550" style="s2">psychologists have no center yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.570" end="00:09:33.630" style="s2">actually you describe some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:40.330" style="s2">questions I&#39;ve asked about my own life</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.630" end="00:09:42.710" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.330" end="00:09:44.690" style="s2">actually yes funny but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.710" end="00:09:46.940" style="s2">right you know Bobby I loved your</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.690" end="00:09:49.400" style="s2">conversation with John and I heard</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.940" end="00:09:52.339" style="s2">John&#39;s awakening meaning Christ love</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.400" end="00:09:54.410" style="s2">with him you know yeah and and your</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.339" end="00:09:56.990" style="s2">question right there is exactly what my</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.410" end="00:09:59.089" style="s2">whole point is is that actually the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.990" end="00:10:01.880" style="s2">modern scientific enterprise which came</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.089" end="00:10:04.250" style="s2">dominant and displaced yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.880" end="00:10:06.770" style="s2">religions before which I though they</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.250" end="00:10:09.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the right logos in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.770" end="00:10:13.490" style="s2">they had a lot more to say about our</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.560" end="00:10:15.860" style="s2">meaning yeah yeah and then so science</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.490" end="00:10:17.300" style="s2">cuts a lot of the legs out from under</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.860" end="00:10:20.930" style="s2">that right</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.300" end="00:10:22.730" style="s2">and breaks down at psychology right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.930" end="00:10:26.330" style="s2">not accidental that we have an acute</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.730" end="00:10:28.970" style="s2">moderate meaning crisis my life other</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.330" end="00:10:30.620" style="s2">than just getting money and eating fun</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.970" end="00:10:34.220" style="s2">things and having sex and being</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.620" end="00:10:37.610" style="s2">self-interested until I die right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.220" end="00:10:39.620" style="s2">like well that&#39;s capitalism for you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.610" end="00:10:41.570" style="s2">know you&#39;re you&#39;re a physical entity and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.620" end="00:10:43.940" style="s2">you know you&#39;re self-interested based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.570" end="00:10:46.250" style="s2">evolution and you&#39;re so go out and do</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.940" end="00:10:49.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s like oh my god that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.250" end="00:10:51.890" style="s2">know soul or the spirit you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.610" end="00:10:55.550" style="s2">and indeed I think it&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.890" end="00:10:57.860" style="s2">wrong yeah and so so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.550" end="00:11:00.620" style="s2">connected I think the absence of right</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.860" end="00:11:03.019" style="s2">but yet the science deeply connects to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.620" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">our philosophy of our psychologies of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.019" end="00:11:10.760" style="s2">our societies what did you yeah sister</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.160" end="00:11:12.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like kind of there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.760" end="00:11:14.510" style="s2">which I just you know as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.500" end="00:11:17.709" style="s2">about this you know I want to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.510" end="00:11:20.810" style="s2">about the scientific method it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.709" end="00:11:23.630" style="s2">like its core method is to bracket out</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.810" end="00:11:27.140" style="s2">everything that is basically subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.630" end="00:11:29.450" style="s2">or psychological right so just like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.140" end="00:11:31.940" style="s2">and so how do you deal with these</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.450" end="00:11:34.010" style="s2">phenomena called mind that don&#39;t are</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.940" end="00:11:36.050" style="s2">connected to right to a substance like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.010" end="00:11:38.750" style="s2">substance yeah I could see a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.050" end="00:11:42.649" style="s2">crisis out of it yet having a as a field</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.750" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">a pressure to be scientific yet a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.649" end="00:11:47.140" style="s2">phenomena that won&#39;t reveal itself just</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:50.149" style="s2">in that way</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.140" end="00:11:53.020" style="s2">exactly exactly a minute yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.149" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s exactly where in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.020" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">so what Watson does is he takes strictly</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:00.890" style="s2">the scientific method yeah he says well</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:04.339" style="s2">if I&#39;m gonna use this as my lens</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.890" end="00:12:06.740" style="s2">consciousness is gone right right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.339" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">then the arguments about what all that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.740" end="00:12:12.709" style="s2">is and we never got the right</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:16.279" style="s2">descriptive framework for what we mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.709" end="00:12:17.240" style="s2">by the term mind that&#39;s what and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.279" end="00:12:19.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.240" end="00:12:21.230" style="s2">teaches you is it gives you a new</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.130" end="00:12:25.010" style="s2">vocabulary to talk about this concept</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.230" end="00:12:27.680" style="s2">mind right and if any changes are some</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.010" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">of our definitions so for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.680" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">know the shape of it it goes from matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:36.819" style="s2">I don khon a matter yep into life and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">then into mind and then into culture yep</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.819" end="00:12:41.509" style="s2">now I&#39;m and by each one of those at</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:42.680" style="s2">least when we&#39;re talking with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.509" end="00:12:44.660" style="s2">language game in the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.680" end="00:12:46.339" style="s2">each one of those are capitalized so</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.660" end="00:12:48.589" style="s2">that you know prop there&#39;s a proper</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.339" end="00:12:52.910" style="s2">conceptual definition and reference</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.589" end="00:12:56.170" style="s2">point right so mind on the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.910" end="00:12:59.420" style="s2">knowledge yeah to the third dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.170" end="00:13:01.999" style="s2">behavioral complexity yeah which is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:05.449" style="s2">animal mental dimension of complain</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.999" end="00:13:07.759" style="s2">right okay and what that means is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.449" end="00:13:11.870" style="s2">argument is that animals are playing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.759" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">game of existence yeah at a sub or of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.870" end="00:13:16.939" style="s2">superordinate level relative to plants</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:18.860" style="s2">and cells which in a game of existence</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.939" end="00:13:21.740" style="s2">at a superordinate level relative to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.860" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">chemistry and atoms yeah yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.740" end="00:13:25.550" style="s2">it and the first thing we want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:28.660" style="s2">get that landscape right which I</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.550" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">actually call capital and mind right</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.660" end="00:13:35.269" style="s2">right yeah so this is gonna actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:37.459" style="s2">address a key problem of the observation</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.269" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">so that day what are we actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.459" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">observing and what is our language</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:44.990" style="s2">referring to yeah yeah yeah so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:46.790" style="s2">fish right over here and a fish tank I</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.990" end="00:13:48.290" style="s2">don&#39;t show you but anyway the fish are</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.790" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">swimming around well they&#39;re swimming</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.290" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">around is mind I&#39;m looking I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:54.769" style="s2">look out there and say that oh look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:13:58.490" style="s2">them living which they are yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.769" end="00:14:01.370" style="s2">that&#39;s mind yeah yeah look at them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.490" end="00:14:03.110" style="s2">look at their mental behavior right guys</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.370" end="00:14:06.680" style="s2">went around and I feed them and they go</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.110" end="00:14:08.839" style="s2">up me eat I&#39;m team mine just you watch</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.680" end="00:14:12.980" style="s2">your plant grow you&#39;re watching life</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.839" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">yeah right right so now I have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.980" end="00:14:17.990" style="s2">language that says oh I am now I saw I</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:20.540" style="s2">can be a scientist and say I study mine</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.990" end="00:14:23.629" style="s2">defined as mental behavior gives me a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.540" end="00:14:25.699" style="s2">behavioral definition of mind Hey</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.629" end="00:14:27.050" style="s2">but what it but the behaviors did is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.699" end="00:14:28.249" style="s2">they just call it they were so anti</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.050" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">mentalistic they didn&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.249" end="00:14:32.509" style="s2">actually they weren&#39;t interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:35.389" style="s2">behavior in general like drop rock from</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.509" end="00:14:38.029" style="s2">a you know building they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.389" end="00:14:38.449" style="s2">in a very unique kind of behavior the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.029" end="00:14:41.420" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.449" end="00:14:43.580" style="s2">Moses holes with complex bodies mediated</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.420" end="00:14:46.050" style="s2">by a break right right</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.580" end="00:14:47.280" style="s2">totally that&#39;s it that&#39;s what animals do</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.050" end="00:14:50.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s what they do so crazy</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.280" end="00:14:51.420" style="s2">relative to plants or rocks right right</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.420" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">suits in that so the adjective mental</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:14:58.740" style="s2">says oh that&#39;s the unique way in which</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:00.840" style="s2">you know so if you have a dead cat falls</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.740" end="00:15:02.940" style="s2">out of a tree and a live cat will fall</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.840" end="00:15:04.950" style="s2">similarly but the live cut current lands</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.940" end="00:15:06.900" style="s2">on its feet and takes off well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.950" end="00:15:08.370" style="s2">actor out the gravity and you say well</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.900" end="00:15:12.030" style="s2">the landing on the feet taken off that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.370" end="00:15:12.540" style="s2">mental behavior yeah yeah yes good I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.030" end="00:15:15.450" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.540" end="00:15:17.520" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a definition now of mine</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.450" end="00:15:18.590" style="s2">not conscious not phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.520" end="00:15:22.470" style="s2">consciousness but now we actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.590" end="00:15:25.140" style="s2">language of modeling totally yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.470" end="00:15:27.090" style="s2">actually have third-person right one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.140" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">the things that the system does is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.090" end="00:15:31.860" style="s2">helps figure out cuz you&#39;re exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:33.510" style="s2">right this split and you out you know I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.860" end="00:15:36.600" style="s2">know you know some about integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.510" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">yeah and and this is Wilbur&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.600" end="00:15:41.190" style="s2">right about this he&#39;s entrence show you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">know the insides that right hand side</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.190" end="00:15:46.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s that external exterior</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.800" end="00:15:49.380" style="s2">epistemology that you can take camera</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.290" end="00:15:51.300" style="s2">yeah hey not too sciences it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.380" end="00:15:53.220" style="s2">observer measure of it you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.300" end="00:15:55.620" style="s2">and I can look at and it&#39;s whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.220" end="00:15:58.890" style="s2">camera records right right right</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.620" end="00:16:01.290" style="s2">can&#39;t take a camera of your inside yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.890" end="00:16:03.210" style="s2">exactly so that&#39;s why I was always</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.290" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">really complicated but you know make a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.210" end="00:16:10.110" style="s2">camera behavior how we interact yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:11.790" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like basically what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.110" end="00:16:13.430" style="s2">hearing is like mine the picture I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.790" end="00:16:16.050" style="s2">getting is everything that you described</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.430" end="00:16:18.300" style="s2">like there&#39;s this there&#39;s a sense where</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.050" end="00:16:22.110" style="s2">the movement that you see is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.300" end="00:16:24.330" style="s2">comported to beyond itself right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.110" end="00:16:27.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s extended in some way in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.330" end="00:16:30.060" style="s2">responsive to what everything else or</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.240" end="00:16:32.460" style="s2">what in its view so just like sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.060" end="00:16:35.580" style="s2">responsiveness rapes whatever you see</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.460" end="00:16:38.040" style="s2">that that phenomena we remind right</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.580" end="00:16:39.900" style="s2">exactly and once you learn how to look</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.040" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">where you see really easy its sense for</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.900" end="00:16:45.270" style="s2">Aristotle at the sensory motor animal</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:48.060" style="s2">level yeah the vegetative level yes I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.270" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">just I call it functional awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.060" end="00:16:53.370" style="s2">response yeah yeah you can observe</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:54.420" style="s2">somebody you you we pay all attention to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.370" end="00:16:55.740" style="s2">what other people are paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.420" end="00:16:59.280" style="s2">to like what</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.740" end="00:17:01.620" style="s2">you&#39;re not paying attention functional</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.280" end="00:17:02.850" style="s2">awareness of response right right</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.620" end="00:17:06.420" style="s2">totally from a third-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.850" end="00:17:08.370" style="s2">we see it all the time right I call it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.420" end="00:17:11.880" style="s2">this I call it the excuse of why I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:13.560" style="s2">trouble yes people trying to control</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.880" end="00:17:16.650" style="s2">your attention and they see you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.560" end="00:17:31.260" style="s2">paying attention exactly the start of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:32.760" style="s2">all mine the rest of the tree John would</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.260" end="00:17:37.560" style="s2">appreciate that from a relevance</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.760" end="00:17:39.930" style="s2">realization absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.560" end="00:17:42.450" style="s2">yes so the argument is is that the base</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.930" end="00:17:44.970" style="s2">here of mind is this cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.450" end="00:17:46.800" style="s2">functional process of Oh cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.970" end="00:17:48.600" style="s2">revolutions like oh we have information</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.800" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">processing you know nervous system is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.600" end="00:17:53.430" style="s2">that yeah and then you have the base</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:56.460" style="s2">what I call mind one is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.430" end="00:17:58.620" style="s2">neurocognitive functionalist view ok and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.460" end="00:18:01.320" style="s2">then what you were getting at with what</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.620" end="00:18:04.920" style="s2">I call mine - mine - is subjective</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:07.170" style="s2">phenomenology right right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.920" end="00:18:08.790" style="s2">that&#39;s across the epistemological what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.170" end="00:18:11.460" style="s2">call the pistol ma logical gap that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.790" end="00:18:14.190" style="s2">the Wilber interior/exterior problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.460" end="00:18:16.500" style="s2">right right and why the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.190" end="00:18:18.210" style="s2">approach to consciousness is really that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.500" end="00:18:20.520" style="s2">level of that kind of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.210" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">very difficult yeah you can&#39;t look at it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.520" end="00:18:25.650" style="s2">with a camera yeah yeah and experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:30.450" style="s2">it from the witnessing function of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.650" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">own perspective right right in the in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.450" end="00:18:36.450" style="s2">and so that&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:38.310" style="s2">that sits above mind well that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.450" end="00:18:39.960" style="s2">the mental dimension the argument is get</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.310" end="00:18:41.820" style="s2">a brain and we actually don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.960" end="00:18:45.270" style="s2">somewhere along the animal kingdom brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.820" end="00:18:47.820" style="s2">level it into bees and insects I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.270" end="00:18:50.580" style="s2">know we don&#39;t really know but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:54.450" style="s2">by the time you&#39;re on a rat ok and Earth</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.580" end="00:18:56.340" style="s2">ok maybe my fish invertebrates there was</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.450" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">a 10 years ago there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.340" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">special issue do what you know what kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:03.930" style="s2">of pain if any do fish feel and then I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">had all these experts on consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.930" end="00:19:07.620" style="s2">and needless to say it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:09.480" style="s2">complicated question interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.620" end="00:19:12.570" style="s2">arguments on both sides that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.480" end="00:19:15.149" style="s2">you know no they&#39;re basically robots -</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.570" end="00:19:17.340" style="s2">yes they definitely feel pain and at</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.149" end="00:19:19.350" style="s2">least at the Journal of Fisheries in</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.340" end="00:19:21.210" style="s2">2009 or right under the special issue</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.350" end="00:19:23.880" style="s2">buzz I read them and I was like I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.210" end="00:19:27.059" style="s2">they feel pain but do I owe and do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.880" end="00:19:29.279" style="s2">know not really a bar does it go down to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.059" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">a worm feeling pain no we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.279" end="00:19:35.519" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a good understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">mine - okay yeah yet in the emergence we</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.519" end="00:19:39.419" style="s2">know so I think that it comes you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">and I love John&#39;s system we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.419" end="00:19:44.010" style="s2">talking about this I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:46.830" style="s2">these electromagnetic waves that become</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.010" end="00:19:49.380" style="s2">the root of qualia of adjectives of</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.830" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">qualia and then so not as a witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.380" end="00:19:54.630" style="s2">function that emerges with a brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">probably in the know what John calls</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.630" end="00:20:00.299" style="s2">have adverbial qualia oh yeah that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:02.399" style="s2">organizing system and I think certainly</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.299" end="00:20:05.429" style="s2">my fish have a little bit of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.399" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think but we don&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.429" end="00:20:11.070" style="s2">we have to go down through humans yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:14.760" style="s2">to that because humans have mine three</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">yeah so mine free is the jump from mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.760" end="00:20:19.139" style="s2">into culture and that&#39;s wood and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:20.909" style="s2">conscious justification in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.139" end="00:20:22.740" style="s2">justification hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.909" end="00:20:23.669" style="s2">justification system series the theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.740" end="00:20:27.179" style="s2">of human mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.669" end="00:20:28.830" style="s2">three great good so I can tell you el</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.179" end="00:20:30.450" style="s2">guy this is what I feel I feel a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.830" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">nervous coming on your program and I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.450" end="00:20:36.179" style="s2">narrate yeah so that&#39;s I can report on</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:39.029" style="s2">my subjectivity so we can at least have</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.179" end="00:20:42.299" style="s2">an access point right right dog doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.029" end="00:20:43.889" style="s2">have right and and our mind threes take</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.299" end="00:20:45.419" style="s2">us in a totally different you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.889" end="00:20:49.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the culture dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.419" end="00:20:54.149" style="s2">complexity is my yeah yeah that those</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.380" end="00:20:59.429" style="s2">these leaps of complexity I just I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.149" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">that the sense of I think this is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.429" end="00:21:02.669" style="s2">we were talking about before we started</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:04.350" style="s2">recording a bit is like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.669" end="00:21:06.539" style="s2">things I really like about your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.350" end="00:21:10.139" style="s2">right and what I&#39;ve experienced of it so</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.539" end="00:21:13.230" style="s2">far is it oftentimes like models explain</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.370" end="00:22:23.010" style="s2">attends and you know and I sort of saw</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:26.070" style="s2">the puzzle a little bit of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.010" end="00:22:28.890" style="s2">and then I had my first insight in 1996</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.070" end="00:22:32.730" style="s2">into 1997 was on this justification idea</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.299" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2">terms of okay there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.860" end="00:22:48.120" style="s2">happens very important with language and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:50.610" style="s2">the basic story is is this and this</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:20.279" style="s2">but I&#39;m not a person and so the mission</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.470" end="00:23:22.380" style="s2">of justification yeah gets involved and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.279" end="00:23:26.059" style="s2">I stopped getting self reflective</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.190" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">that we have narratives of you know on</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.090" end="00:23:53.990" style="s2">cartoons like you know a but like a</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">because it takes it away from like as if</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.160" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">a person was given with the human form</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:06.990" style="s2">right right right this is actually Peter</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:09.720" style="s2">or Cerio is a psychologist I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.990" end="00:24:11.790" style="s2">maybe eight years ago or so he developed</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.720" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">he saw the problem psychology very</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.790" end="00:24:18.120" style="s2">clearly and developing called</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:19.950" style="s2">descriptive psychology and it that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.120" end="00:24:21.870" style="s2">framed that&#39;s actually what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.950" end="00:24:23.970" style="s2">a descriptive metaphysical approach</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.870" end="00:24:25.620" style="s2">which is metaphysical and this guy</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.970" end="00:24:27.419" style="s2">descriptive metaphysical what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.620" end="00:24:29.880" style="s2">concepts and categories what is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.419" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">death penalty&#39;s like to find your terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.880" end="00:24:36.750" style="s2">right it&#39;s actually a very good you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:38.760" style="s2">what Dean and I realized that psychology</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.750" end="00:24:42.390" style="s2">is this is landmine did so did a serial</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.760" end="00:24:44.570" style="s2">man he one of his most famous works was</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.390" end="00:24:47.190" style="s2">the behavior of persons and he really</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.570" end="00:24:49.230" style="s2">deconstructs and that&#39;s what he realized</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.190" end="00:24:50.970" style="s2">like the concept of a person is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.230" end="00:24:54.570" style="s2">something you grow into and learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.970" end="00:24:56.490" style="s2">play basically and he pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.570" end="00:24:58.440" style="s2">in science fiction you know this is how</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.490" end="00:25:02.220" style="s2">he made it clear to me like Java Baja in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.440" end="00:25:04.830" style="s2">Star Wars he&#39;s a person right he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.220" end="00:25:07.290" style="s2">human but he justifies why he took Leia</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.830" end="00:25:09.809" style="s2">and what wise things he&#39;s doing he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.290" end="00:25:11.429" style="s2">complete person at the full and what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.809" end="00:25:13.559" style="s2">it that define him as a clear personally</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.429" end="00:25:16.020" style="s2">instincts well he justified his actions</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.559" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">in a self-conscious way you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.020" end="00:25:20.850" style="s2">navigated the social stage as an it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:23.970" style="s2">front with a narrative function yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.850" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what so so really you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.970" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">yeah you can really just associate that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:30.059" style="s2">concept from human beings that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:32.340" style="s2">interesting right and that and that gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.059" end="00:25:34.740" style="s2">to it well it&#39;s kind of isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:27:59.929" style="s2">all of the phenomenal elements of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.540" end="00:28:02.090" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.929" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">which has just been fascinating for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.090" end="00:28:07.580" style="s2">and revealing actually revealing of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:10.279" style="s2">experiences that I&#39;ve continued to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.580" end="00:28:12.710" style="s2">with bringing language to him like has</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.279" end="00:28:14.749" style="s2">me be able to make them so much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.710" end="00:28:16.639" style="s2">distinct and like because you can only</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.749" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">relate to things that are distinct right</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.639" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">let&#39;s try it&#39;s like the language but</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:24.289" style="s2">where where I think it was John that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">said he came up with yeah die Lobos</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.289" end="00:28:29.899" style="s2">right and I would also probably say</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:33.190" style="s2">circling right is is is moving from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.899" end="00:28:36.889" style="s2">courtroom right to the courtyard right</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.190" end="00:28:38.899" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting because I like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.889" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">because I think what you&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.899" end="00:28:46.490" style="s2">is that you know it&#39;s fun it&#39;s tricky</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:50.259" style="s2">because you know I we your clinical</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.490" end="00:28:52.940" style="s2">psychologist - right yep yeah yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.259" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s the thing like that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.940" end="00:28:58.279" style="s2">mean the super-ego and the justification</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:29:01.419" style="s2">and all of that is like can&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.279" end="00:29:04.460" style="s2">things that just drive people crazy</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.419" end="00:29:06.019" style="s2">absolutely Oh totally so yeah so listen</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.460" end="00:29:08.090" style="s2">there&#39;s so that you did just a bit what</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.019" end="00:29:08.899" style="s2">the justification dynamic opens up I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.090" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">tell you this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.899" end="00:29:13.759" style="s2">yeah the best way to really get a grasp</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:15.289" style="s2">of the layering of it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.759" end="00:29:17.990" style="s2">actually really three layers and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.289" end="00:29:21.049" style="s2">guys caught two of them and you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.990" end="00:29:24.950" style="s2">into itting the third so is the court</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.049" end="00:29:28.309" style="s2">room yeah that is the defender okay and</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.950" end="00:29:30.350" style="s2">that and you&#39;re in conflict and a social</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.309" end="00:29:31.730" style="s2">pressure not I&#39;m not being literal but</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.350" end="00:29:33.320" style="s2">it could be of course literal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.730" end="00:29:35.749" style="s2">where the whole structure is now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.320" end="00:29:38.059" style="s2">accused and to be held accountable or</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.749" end="00:29:40.999" style="s2">punished as d legitimate and then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.059" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2">defend your justification of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.999" end="00:29:46.850" style="s2">right okay right one and that&#39;s one key</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:49.159" style="s2">feature yeah I mean actually is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.850" end="00:29:53.480" style="s2">structure of self-consciousness is in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.159" end="00:29:56.869" style="s2">part paid it to that right the left</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.480" end="00:29:59.629" style="s2">hemisphere the isn&#39;t just an analytic</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.869" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">reasoning system it is a defender when</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.629" end="00:30:04.999" style="s2">necessary if you are it&#39;s attached to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.200" style="s2">the social field and your place of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.999" end="00:30:08.840" style="s2">social influence I have what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.200" end="00:30:11.240" style="s2">the social influence matrix yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.840" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">is your heart is tracking and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.240" end="00:30:13.670" style="s2">barometer of social influence of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:16.910" style="s2">relational</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.670" end="00:30:18.800" style="s2">back ok right people know and value us</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.910" end="00:30:20.300" style="s2">and love us for the things we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.800" end="00:30:23.060" style="s2">loved for that&#39;s great I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.300" end="00:30:25.940" style="s2">nourished with the soul yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.060" end="00:30:27.290" style="s2">what pulls us and went up like no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.940" end="00:30:29.960" style="s2">gonna get critique you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.290" end="00:30:32.420" style="s2">ignored you&#39;re gonna be rejected oh my</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.960" end="00:30:34.850" style="s2">that&#39;s up and that&#39;s a deep that goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.420" end="00:30:38.270" style="s2">right in even basic physical pain that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.850" end="00:30:40.820" style="s2">sort of yeah right rejection is like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.270" end="00:30:42.530" style="s2">know yeah yeah registers as physical</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.820" end="00:30:44.540" style="s2">pain and it does absolutely it&#39;s a void</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.530" end="00:30:45.890" style="s2">that it&#39;s very the emotional pain that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.540" end="00:30:48.140" style="s2">comes out of that is very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.890" end="00:30:49.880" style="s2">connected right and I think John</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.140" end="00:30:51.980" style="s2">mentioned you know public speaking is</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.880" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">people will fill for the percent of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.980" end="00:30:54.620" style="s2">public speaking fo because it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:56.450" style="s2">than death</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.620" end="00:30:59.960" style="s2">I mean they will fill that it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.450" end="00:31:01.220" style="s2">and so the idea of a crowd deciding that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.960" end="00:31:04.580" style="s2">you have failed and you&#39;ve humiliated</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.220" end="00:31:06.020" style="s2">yourself yeah this that in Michael a and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.580" end="00:31:09.050" style="s2">a hunter-gatherer society that&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.020" end="00:31:12.140" style="s2">far away from death right right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.050" end="00:31:15.710" style="s2">accidental so so you have the courtroom</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.140" end="00:31:19.550" style="s2">side of your justified then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:20.450" style="s2">social pragmatic side yeah okay which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.550" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">the courtyard</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.450" end="00:31:25.310" style="s2">basically yeah and then the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:29.260" style="s2">thing about justification it goes all</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.310" end="00:31:31.070" style="s2">the way up to analytic philosophy okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.260" end="00:31:33.080" style="s2">all the way up to that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.070" end="00:31:36.800" style="s2">discovered they really realized this but</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.080" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">I mean what Plato realizes that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.800" end="00:31:43.610" style="s2">history of knowledge is defied true</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:46.580" style="s2">belief yeah so you have a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.610" end="00:31:48.980" style="s2">statement and it does it correspond to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.580" end="00:31:51.160" style="s2">reality is it therefore true the belief</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.980" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">is it true and what is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.160" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">justification in lay the vacation that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">results in that correspondence yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:03.530" style="s2">so so justification at the analytic</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:06.950" style="s2">level actor then ruse all of Western</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.530" end="00:32:09.830" style="s2">logos hmm the Western logos problem what</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.950" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">is what is analytic and true effective</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.830" end="00:32:14.030" style="s2">of social courtyard dialogue logos this</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">is why the analytic people are you dial</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.030" end="00:32:24.200" style="s2">auditions you know who that what but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:26.899" style="s2">gonna do my math yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.200" end="00:32:30.769" style="s2">analytic justification or</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.899" end="00:32:32.359" style="s2">right so so the justification when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.769" end="00:32:34.519" style="s2">realized with this concept does that go</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.359" end="00:32:36.350" style="s2">all the way from a Freudian idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.519" end="00:32:39.710" style="s2">it explains why we have biological</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.350" end="00:32:41.629" style="s2">psychological drives right not socially</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.710" end="00:32:45.169" style="s2">acceptable that we&#39;ve internalized and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.629" end="00:32:47.690" style="s2">we sit with a eco based justifier let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.169" end="00:32:49.580" style="s2">try to actualize and repress so that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:52.669" style="s2">navigate the reality of our social field</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.580" end="00:32:54.710" style="s2">yeah okay yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.669" end="00:32:56.450" style="s2">that&#39;s Freud&#39;s fundamental insight now</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.710" end="00:32:57.950" style="s2">we can put it totally on an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.450" end="00:33:01.909" style="s2">history the evolution of language</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:03.649" style="s2">created a problem yeah right right okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.909" end="00:33:05.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s like hi because when we now on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.649" end="00:33:06.649" style="s2">field of justification people start</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.119" end="00:33:08.779" style="s2">asking questions why to do what you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.649" end="00:33:11.330" style="s2">if you piss me off and we have a clash</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.779" end="00:33:13.399" style="s2">of social influence or many with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.330" end="00:33:17.210" style="s2">utility of language questions are easy</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.399" end="00:33:18.919" style="s2">to ask they&#39;re hard sir yeah and so how</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.210" end="00:33:20.869" style="s2">do you explain yourself and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.919" end="00:33:23.659" style="s2">attacked and then the other issue is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.869" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">well how do you we just get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.659" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">stuff you know what did I do</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">but then there&#39;s what do we do in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:31.450" style="s2">courtyard why when do we get up and move</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:34.009" style="s2">together that&#39;s our social pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.450" end="00:33:35.809" style="s2">justification right right on the line</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.009" end="00:33:37.940" style="s2">when they discovered mathematics then it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.809" end="00:33:39.799" style="s2">gave rise to formal analytic questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.940" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2">of justification joy well what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.799" end="00:33:43.820" style="s2">objectively true independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">social and subjective which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.820" end="00:33:53.299" style="s2">roots us ultimately into science yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:56.359" style="s2">yeah for justification in subject so</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.299" end="00:34:01.129" style="s2">yeah totally getting at that so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.359" end="00:34:03.980" style="s2">social aspect I think it&#39;s it&#39;s is it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.129" end="00:34:06.230" style="s2">fair to say something like so you what</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.980" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying is that like I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.230" end="00:34:10.819" style="s2">talk I mean you&#39;re talking in like</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:13.329" style="s2">existential phenomenological terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.819" end="00:34:16.730" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying that I am a being that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.329" end="00:34:19.669" style="s2">then is social and then justify it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.730" end="00:34:23.450" style="s2">like it&#39;s more like no I am the being</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.669" end="00:34:26.599" style="s2">that in its being is already always in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.450" end="00:34:29.149" style="s2">in a social justification and oriented</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.599" end="00:34:31.909" style="s2">in that way and concerned about that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.149" end="00:34:33.589" style="s2">like it was like it&#39;s it&#39;s deep it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.909" end="00:34:36.409" style="s2">really right in my class all right</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.589" end="00:34:39.169" style="s2">absolutely and in fact so I mean deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.409" end="00:34:40.250" style="s2">into the phenomenological organization</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.169" end="00:34:42.349" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.250" end="00:34:44.060" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen a picture</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.349" end="00:34:45.500" style="s2">of the influence matrix if if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.060" end="00:34:47.840" style="s2">haven&#39;t and you show pictures on your</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.500" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">thing I&#39;ll be happy to pull it up but</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.840" end="00:34:52.520" style="s2">the influence matrix Maps the socio</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">emotional relational field of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.520" end="00:34:57.710" style="s2">phenomenology right and what it shows is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:00.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s just it just is a depiction of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.710" end="00:35:03.590" style="s2">how we&#39;re organized to track place in</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.080" end="00:35:05.780" style="s2">the social field intuitive yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.590" end="00:35:07.940" style="s2">is fundamentally organizing and then it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.780" end="00:35:11.000" style="s2">organizes us in terms of our we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.940" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">fundamentally defined as attachment no</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.000" end="00:35:15.470" style="s2">our firstborn activity we know our</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:18.500" style="s2">mothers and fathers before we know</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.470" end="00:35:21.349" style="s2">ourselves yeah okay looking for the co</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.500" end="00:35:23.420" style="s2">regulatory structures of the other okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.349" end="00:35:25.430" style="s2">where we are in the social world in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.420" end="00:35:27.710" style="s2">we were unbelievably intimate and social</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.430" end="00:35:30.580" style="s2">before language so so now missionary</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.710" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">level and and ontogenetic level we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.580" end="00:35:36.109" style="s2">beans right the justification problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:39.650" style="s2">emerges on top of that and in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.109" end="00:35:42.440" style="s2">context yes so even in the even in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.650" end="00:35:43.790" style="s2">sense of like you know hey this is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.440" end="00:35:45.800" style="s2">riddle I&#39;ve been thinking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.790" end="00:35:46.250" style="s2">of where you can kind of get the point</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.800" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.250" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">you know if I&#39;m an artist so I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.410" end="00:35:53.890" style="s2">I&#39;m an artist and and I just I paint the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:55.970" style="s2">most incredible piece of art ever and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.890" end="00:35:58.220" style="s2">then the moment I&#39;m done and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.970" end="00:36:00.650" style="s2">cherishing it and I think about it being</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.220" end="00:36:03.710" style="s2">seen by other people and I imagine them</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.650" end="00:36:05.660" style="s2">criticizing it right and so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.710" end="00:36:07.099" style="s2">tolerate them the idea of being</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.660" end="00:36:10.430" style="s2">criticized so I destroy the painting</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.099" end="00:36:13.490" style="s2">right so the question the riddle is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.430" end="00:36:16.849" style="s2">like well did did did I did I avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.490" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">criticism right I mean I think what</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.849" end="00:36:19.700" style="s2">you&#39;re what you&#39;re kind of saying you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:22.210" style="s2">kind of saying at the deepest level have</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.700" end="00:36:25.609" style="s2">really no in fact we&#39;re always already</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.210" end="00:36:28.609" style="s2">in it&#39;s like is it is it fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.609" end="00:36:31.580" style="s2">that an experiential a level like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.609" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">way that my my life is animated right</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.580" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">shows up for me close to me is imbued</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:41.630" style="s2">with sociality right absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:45.260" style="s2">absolutely you know and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.630" end="00:36:48.290" style="s2">great western weaknesses I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.260" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">that fact is horribly underplayed with</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.290" end="00:36:53.170" style="s2">what ends in dental ego and analytic</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:56.450" style="s2">justification emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:59.990" style="s2">vigil istic especially United States and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.450" end="00:37:03.110" style="s2">its individualism we are our social</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.820" end="00:37:14.060" style="s2">existence right so crucial um so yeah</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.060" end="00:37:17.540" style="s2">and and I think we failed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.770" end="00:37:19.190" style="s2">fundamentally appreciate that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.540" end="00:37:21.230" style="s2">mean under Gabor&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.190" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">I mean hunter-gatherers and a new very</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.230" end="00:37:27.560" style="s2">dangerous aspect of human sociology was</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:29.360" style="s2">power right people would collect</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.780" end="00:37:42.890" style="s2">off you get some warnings yeah and there</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.510" end="00:37:45.080" style="s2">are a lot of stories of five hunters</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.890" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">going out and for coming back because</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.080" end="00:37:50.450" style="s2">they&#39;ve got taken power in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:53.270" style="s2">you can get the message right right they</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.450" end="00:37:55.130" style="s2">support the matrix&#39;s there&#39;s love power</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.270" end="00:37:57.410" style="s2">and freedom on the process dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.130" end="00:38:01.790" style="s2">well they emphasize love and freedom</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.410" end="00:38:04.820" style="s2">over power too so we have collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.790" end="00:38:07.610" style="s2">mutuality because power dangerous well</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.820" end="00:38:09.380" style="s2">you know we forgot we did we bagged that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.610" end="00:38:10.970" style="s2">idea you know we basically are like</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.380" end="00:38:13.250" style="s2">money and power and individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.970" end="00:38:13.970" style="s2">achievement you know I like to say we</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.970" end="00:38:18.590" style="s2">not that I&#39;m excited about that but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.860" end="00:38:20.210" style="s2">a caricature of the value relational</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.590" end="00:38:23.090" style="s2">value structures Obama</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.820" end="00:38:39.380" style="s2">this is the way you try to structure</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.290" end="00:38:40.850" style="s2">your relational dimension because then</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.380" end="00:38:42.770" style="s2">people feel the resentment they feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.850" end="00:38:44.870" style="s2">that the struggle they want that power</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.770" end="00:38:47.060" style="s2">that everybody wants it cousin Edison</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.870" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah you know so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.060" end="00:38:50.840" style="s2">very very this big dynamic here we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:53.750" style="s2">to figure out pathways of love and</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.840" end="00:39:00.500" style="s2">freedom oh that&#39;s right totally</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.750" end="00:39:02.060" style="s2">so so the thing about um yeah I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.500" end="00:39:04.100" style="s2">of the ways that like one of the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.060" end="00:39:06.430" style="s2">you know I sometimes think about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.100" end="00:39:07.720" style="s2">too is this level of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.430" end="00:39:09.579" style="s2">I mean this is this stuff is just</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.720" end="00:39:11.609" style="s2">fascinating to me and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.579" end="00:39:14.349" style="s2">things I&#39;ve learned in circling and just</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.609" end="00:39:16.270" style="s2">being in relationship if we say circling</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.349" end="00:39:18.250" style="s2">is kind of a and this is what I love to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.270" end="00:39:20.440" style="s2">kind of talk with you about of like from</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.250" end="00:39:23.349" style="s2">the model of just articulating some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.440" end="00:39:24.940" style="s2">the things that happen encircling my</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.349" end="00:39:26.410" style="s2">experience and dialo ghost and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.940" end="00:39:30.819" style="s2">everything we&#39;ve been talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.410" end="00:39:33.130" style="s2">that seemed to be so central right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.819" end="00:39:37.690" style="s2">one of the one of the reasons why I</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.130" end="00:39:40.029" style="s2">think circling is and actually the role</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.690" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">of technology to around this like what</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.029" end="00:39:44.500" style="s2">what is that like what is the impact you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:47.020" style="s2">know and a lot of this really comes out</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.500" end="00:39:49.450" style="s2">of my grappling with Heidegger for come</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.020" end="00:39:50.890" style="s2">over the last 20-something years right</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.450" end="00:39:53.859" style="s2">what he talks about you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.890" end="00:39:56.279" style="s2">his work around technology recently but</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.859" end="00:39:58.930" style="s2">this is on my to-do list especially with</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.279" end="00:40:00.970" style="s2">John and everything else so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.930" end="00:40:01.900" style="s2">list right here and a couple of hires or</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.970" end="00:40:03.670" style="s2">things I need to check out some</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.900" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">underdeveloped on Heidegger I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.670" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:11.650" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk to I&#39;ll talk with you about</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:13.990" style="s2">Heidegger anytime so basically it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.650" end="00:40:17.049" style="s2">kind of like his his senses is he really</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.990" end="00:40:19.710" style="s2">highlighted how that we that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.049" end="00:40:22.299" style="s2">he&#39;s not talking about technological</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.710" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">mechanisms or devices he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.299" end="00:40:29.890" style="s2">an understanding of the being of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:32.140" style="s2">so the context of context right like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.890" end="00:40:35.109" style="s2">background sense of what by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.140" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">which anything is at all to us how it be</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.109" end="00:40:40.150" style="s2">the ad structure right yes like as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:42.010" style="s2">person as an object he&#39;s just basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.150" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">saying he&#39;s saying like technology has</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.010" end="00:40:50.020" style="s2">this way of his like things show up as</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:52.930" style="s2">positions right as is available for</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.020" end="00:40:55.089" style="s2">extraction of energy or endless or</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.930" end="00:40:56.770" style="s2">durability and then even our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.089" end="00:40:59.049" style="s2">right even our bodies like we look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.770" end="00:41:02.049" style="s2">like body you know mind hacking right</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.049" end="00:41:05.170" style="s2">all them all you know I condemn I met a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.049" end="00:41:07.029" style="s2">bit directly okay but where by where my</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.170" end="00:41:10.450" style="s2">where I&#39;ve been really interested in in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.029" end="00:41:14.589" style="s2">in going well how about why did circling</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.450" end="00:41:17.890" style="s2">right a few guys like dorky dudes right</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.589" end="00:41:19.700" style="s2">like use of childhoods right like like</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.890" end="00:41:22.760" style="s2">stumble along this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.700" end="00:41:26.390" style="s2">about relating that glow to us what</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.760" end="00:41:28.609" style="s2">within within 15-20 years how did that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.390" end="00:41:33.890" style="s2">go get all over the world that practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.609" end="00:41:36.140" style="s2">and and so I feel that that that on one</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.890" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">level the answer to that is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.140" end="00:41:40.609" style="s2">circling is right yeah I think another</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:44.329" style="s2">level it also discloses a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.609" end="00:41:46.910" style="s2">world right and I I&#39;ve just wondered</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.329" end="00:41:51.619" style="s2">about you know with the given that this</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.910" end="00:41:54.260" style="s2">justification dynamic is so central to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.619" end="00:41:56.329" style="s2">like the structure of our being right in</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.260" end="00:42:00.410" style="s2">a certain sense right and we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.329" end="00:42:03.320" style="s2">in it and that for for years and years</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.410" end="00:42:07.220" style="s2">and years most of that has is almost all</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.320" end="00:42:09.349" style="s2">of it has been like it it&#39;s done where I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:11.930" style="s2">say stuff and you&#39;re it&#39;s in direct</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.349" end="00:42:14.930" style="s2">response to other bodies right and all</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.930" end="00:42:17.420" style="s2">these different what happens when all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.930" end="00:42:20.450" style="s2">a sudden there&#39;s a division now where I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.420" end="00:42:22.220" style="s2">can uncollapse the relational dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.450" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">which you know there&#39;s tons of morality</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.220" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">and ethics and something just happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:29.720" style="s2">in our bodies right when like we</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:31.660" style="s2">outsource all of our communication to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.720" end="00:42:34.550" style="s2">where you don&#39;t have that immediacy</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.660" end="00:42:37.220" style="s2">right where are most of my friends are</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.550" end="00:42:38.900" style="s2">people I&#39;ve never met right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.220" end="00:42:42.790" style="s2">through text exchange and there&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.900" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">division and I I have a feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.790" end="00:42:48.970" style="s2">that&#39;s you know 35 years ago if we say</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:54.740" style="s2">that circling to say is like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.970" end="00:42:58.339" style="s2">relational yoga before technology right</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.740" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">in innocence social technologies I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.339" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">know if it would even make sense to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:03.829" style="s2">that because I&#39;m some so many leveled</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:06.740" style="s2">there was so much interaction by virtue</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.829" end="00:43:08.930" style="s2">of living right that if you had if I had</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.740" end="00:43:11.390" style="s2">to like exchange information I had to at</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.930" end="00:43:12.920" style="s2">least call you and deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.390" end="00:43:15.950" style="s2">courtroom right baby</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.920" end="00:43:18.619" style="s2">no absolutely right what is like what</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.950" end="00:43:21.109" style="s2">what like when you look at like what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.619" end="00:43:21.890" style="s2">it yeah so lots of lots to say there</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.109" end="00:43:24.290" style="s2">what&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.890" end="00:43:26.569" style="s2">so first yes I would certainly say we go</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.290" end="00:43:28.730" style="s2">back to her gatherers certainly well</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.569" end="00:43:32.359" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of what we did yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.730" end="00:43:33.230" style="s2">yeah all right if we say that then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.359" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">like yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.230" end="00:43:36.859" style="s2">think you are reinventing I think what</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">you did is essentially reinventing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.859" end="00:43:43.790" style="s2">way were structured right and had lost</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:45.230" style="s2">yeah okay so now let&#39;s go with your</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.790" end="00:43:52.280" style="s2">Heidegger point let&#39;s go back to look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.230" end="00:43:54.380" style="s2">invention it&#39;s like my website it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.280" end="00:43:56.270" style="s2">part of what we need for it&#39;s a central</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.380" end="00:43:57.859" style="s2">part of book that I&#39;m into what I call</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.270" end="00:44:00.470" style="s2">them whiteman 2.0 which is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.859" end="00:44:02.150" style="s2">reboot so that we actually align our</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.470" end="00:44:05.480" style="s2">knowledge and wisdom structures and our</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.150" end="00:44:08.510" style="s2">practices yeah with our nature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.480" end="00:44:10.250" style="s2">that&#39;s what we screwed up we don&#39;t oh we</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.510" end="00:44:13.190" style="s2">gave it over to science I had a I had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.250" end="00:44:15.320" style="s2">conversation with one of my nephews at a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.190" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">family reunion in New York oh it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.320" end="00:44:18.859" style="s2">like he&#39;s had two two classes in college</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:25.100" style="s2">like what did you learn well basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.859" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">I&#39;m all just a bunch of camels like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.100" end="00:44:31.490" style="s2">your parents my brother and sister put</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:33.830" style="s2">spent $20,000 and you your philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.490" end="00:44:35.840" style="s2">life now is that you came back and your</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.830" end="00:44:37.700" style="s2">cares and your loves and your is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.840" end="00:44:40.130" style="s2">what you really realize you know so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.700" end="00:44:42.530" style="s2">adds a physical reductionism okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.130" end="00:44:45.109" style="s2">physical physical reductionism I know</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.530" end="00:44:48.410" style="s2">just which is wrong and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.109" end="00:44:51.859" style="s2">do you okay right okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.410" end="00:44:54.350" style="s2">so so look that&#39;s a tragedy yeah so now</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.859" end="00:44:56.840" style="s2">let&#39;s go to what hire is catchy right</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.350" end="00:44:58.490" style="s2">yeah Heidegger is catching what I do</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.840" end="00:45:00.700" style="s2">know about how yours is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.490" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">organized around the essence of care</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.700" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">yeah bingo all right and and how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:10.820" style="s2">position ourselves in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:13.130" style="s2">the environment yeah okay okay that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.820" end="00:45:15.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t know I doubt it I mean I but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.130" end="00:45:18.230" style="s2">joint point from like to mind is called</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.560" end="00:45:20.930" style="s2">behavioral investment theory right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.230" end="00:45:23.450" style="s2">what it says is the nervous system is an</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.930" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">investment value system that organizes</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.450" end="00:45:29.780" style="s2">the expenditure of your work energy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:32.630" style="s2">okay yes in other words at its essence</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.780" end="00:45:34.850" style="s2">it is a care system value system and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.630" end="00:45:36.650" style="s2">it&#39;s orienting so right so from that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.850" end="00:45:39.290" style="s2">arrangement Heidegger&#39;s going through</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.650" end="00:45:41.630" style="s2">phenomenology but this up their nervous</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.290" end="00:45:43.220" style="s2">system evolutionary nervous okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.630" end="00:45:45.140" style="s2">no no about them but actually if we see</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.220" end="00:45:46.619" style="s2">their behavior we can see what they care</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.140" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">about in terms of their the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.619" end="00:45:53.099" style="s2">Yeah right alright so so then let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:53.819" style="s2">about care there now let&#39;s go from my</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.099" end="00:45:56.789" style="s2">fish</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.819" end="00:46:00.029" style="s2">okay to dogs and then primates the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.789" end="00:46:02.819" style="s2">social mammals great all the way up into</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.029" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">our pre verbal ancestors who lived an</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.819" end="00:46:10.670" style="s2">unbelievably complicated close-knit</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:14.420" style="s2">gathering Dunbar number communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.670" end="00:46:16.589" style="s2">right where where my whole existence is</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.420" end="00:46:18.509" style="s2">fundamentally dependent upon what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.589" end="00:46:21.509" style="s2">women gather and what the men bring home</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.509" end="00:46:25.710" style="s2">to hunt and what are together right</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.509" end="00:46:27.569" style="s2">right okay so now what we have it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.710" end="00:46:29.960" style="s2">just a me versus the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.569" end="00:46:32.549" style="s2">caring about the environment but is me</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.960" end="00:46:34.200" style="s2">existing in a field of relate what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.549" end="00:46:37.559" style="s2">call social influence and relational</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.200" end="00:46:39.450" style="s2">value right right uh-huh and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.559" end="00:46:41.430" style="s2">tracking what the unified theory says</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.450" end="00:46:43.499" style="s2">that we are tracking in our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.430" end="00:46:46.890" style="s2">system is the experience of being known</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.499" end="00:46:48.660" style="s2">and valued by important others yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.890" end="00:46:50.430" style="s2">then against the experience being known</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.660" end="00:46:53.789" style="s2">and valued by important others that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.430" end="00:46:55.710" style="s2">the barometer right right because the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.789" end="00:46:58.410" style="s2">fund owning value other people work on</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.710" end="00:47:01.589" style="s2">my behalf and if I&#39;m not I in other</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.410" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">words if I&#39;m cared for yeah and care</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.589" end="00:47:08.219" style="s2">about in a reciprocal circling yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.619" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.219" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">which as to my mind is it what it does</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.619" end="00:47:15.660" style="s2">is create a culture to enhance our</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.880" style="s2">mutual relational value</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.660" end="00:47:19.380" style="s2">yeah because I and I married you and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.880" end="00:47:24.469" style="s2">mirror that back to me well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.380" end="00:47:28.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it spreads agape its words yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.469" end="00:47:30.059" style="s2">yes and it makes people like I like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.140" end="00:47:32.279" style="s2">like what John highlighted and his</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.059" end="00:47:34.799" style="s2">theories about it that way that was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.279" end="00:47:36.599" style="s2">right that&#39;s that is the energy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.799" end="00:47:39.059" style="s2">the relational energy and then we just</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.599" end="00:47:40.920" style="s2">learn how to justify and what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.059" end="00:47:42.900" style="s2">if you learn how to justify on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.920" end="00:47:47.400" style="s2">foundation of love then you become your</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.900" end="00:47:48.809" style="s2">true self yeah okay yeah right yes then</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.400" end="00:47:51.539" style="s2">you&#39;re known and valued this is what</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.809" end="00:47:54.210" style="s2">Roger saw right Karl rock is like as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.539" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">therapist I&#39;m gonna create a context of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.210" end="00:47:59.160" style="s2">non-judgmental acceptance unconditional</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:00.030" style="s2">positive guard and accurate foundational</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.160" end="00:48:01.950" style="s2">empathy</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.030" end="00:48:04.890" style="s2">organismic valuing process of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.950" end="00:48:06.930" style="s2">individual yeah yeah right so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.890" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">sit here and I&#39;m gonna see you guy I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:48:40.860" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">flourishing and real realization its</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.490" end="00:48:48.780" style="s2">potential yeah actualization that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:50.100" style="s2">trip that&#39;s the growth towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.780" end="00:48:52.700" style="s2">self-actualization because you get that</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.100" end="00:48:55.860" style="s2">though when you say well I love you if</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.700" end="00:49:01.350" style="s2">you believe in me and you do what I say</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.860" end="00:49:03.150" style="s2">right now all the sudden you got the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.350" end="00:49:04.980" style="s2">public private now you&#39;re gonna lie now</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.150" end="00:49:09.030" style="s2">you gonna hide now you go to descend you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.980" end="00:49:16.230" style="s2">create all the static between right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.030" end="00:49:22.530" style="s2">like a defensive yeah basically oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.230" end="00:49:24.840" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gonna judge me somebody oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.530" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">I&#39;m in a position now I got a defense</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.840" end="00:49:34.530" style="s2">carve out my territory and maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:36.390" style="s2">cycle of chaos right so interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.530" end="00:49:41.070" style="s2">when you think about what I when I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.390" end="00:49:43.050" style="s2">about the how the West basically it it</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.070" end="00:49:45.210" style="s2">it ritualized that structure in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.050" end="00:49:46.790" style="s2">court system right the courtroom is</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.210" end="00:49:51.120" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s almost like a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.790" end="00:49:53.400" style="s2">like like archetype of that right it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.120" end="00:49:56.310" style="s2">the professionalization and codification</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.400" end="00:49:57.960" style="s2">of justification yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.310" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">exactly what it is they had to create a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.960" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">they at once before when we can all do</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:04.950" style="s2">it and sit around in a dumb bar number</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:08.250" style="s2">one and it was all about reputation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.950" end="00:50:09.930" style="s2">indigenous you know and you would do</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.250" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">something and you make up and bottle off</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.930" end="00:50:14.600" style="s2">but I&#39;m at the level of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:17.750" style="s2">there are thousands of people involved</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.600" end="00:50:18.860" style="s2">okay there was to adjudicate so we had</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.750" end="00:50:21.080" style="s2">to create in fact this is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.860" end="00:50:23.150" style="s2">civilization did is it took what was the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.080" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">indigenous level of justification court</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.150" end="00:50:28.730" style="s2">the room courtyard stuff the real level</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:30.560" style="s2">of I know you and you know me and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.730" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">have a history we ever shared narratives</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.560" end="00:50:35.600" style="s2">or knipfing structure of what our</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:38.600" style="s2">community believes and then we built</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.600" end="00:50:41.330" style="s2">civilization well now you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.600" end="00:50:44.000" style="s2">top-down broadcast structure of some</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.330" end="00:50:45.470" style="s2">formal system yeah that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:47.840" style="s2">hierarchy that everybody then it</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.470" end="00:50:50.270" style="s2">downloads the ideology and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.840" end="00:50:52.730" style="s2">more and more complicated rule</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.270" end="00:50:54.700" style="s2">structures that then de Judah Kate you</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.730" end="00:50:58.250" style="s2">know because you can&#39;t based on</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:51:01.100" style="s2">indigenous negotiation right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.250" end="00:51:02.870" style="s2">there&#39;s it so there&#39;s like um and one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.100" end="00:51:03.950" style="s2">the things that you said in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.870" end="00:51:06.770" style="s2">when it asked you to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.950" end="00:51:09.580" style="s2">about to was you know what you talked</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.770" end="00:51:12.710" style="s2">about something about well okay um</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.580" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like there&#39;s a thing there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.710" end="00:51:16.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a threat right a thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:19.450" style="s2">can do now call the leg with with</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.790" end="00:51:22.790" style="s2">conversation which is reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.450" end="00:51:24.880" style="s2">right that can you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.790" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">about that like like one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.880" end="00:51:30.650" style="s2">innovations if you will right was this</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:33.770" style="s2">ability to converse and then reverse</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.650" end="00:51:38.750" style="s2">engineer like your justification through</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.770" end="00:51:40.340" style="s2">contract right right right so so when I</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.750" end="00:51:41.630" style="s2">talk about reverse engineering what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.340" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">trying to what I mean there in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.630" end="00:51:46.040" style="s2">formal sort of academic sense is what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:48.590" style="s2">did is I reverse engineer the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.040" end="00:51:51.290" style="s2">interpreter a function of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.590" end="00:51:54.050" style="s2">self-consciousness yet yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.290" end="00:51:55.820" style="s2">so so in other words rather than we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.050" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">the experience of just generating our</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.820" end="00:52:00.620" style="s2">beliefs okay and then just descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:02.840" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on and sort of what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.620" end="00:52:05.120" style="s2">think but this is just what we see yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.840" end="00:52:08.090" style="s2">and what may propositional e make sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.120" end="00:52:10.130" style="s2">out of us yeah well the justification so</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.090" end="00:52:11.720" style="s2">the hypothesis tells you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.130" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">that things run in a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.720" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">program right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.540" style="s2">totally it is functionally organized</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">those beliefs are not coming at you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.540" end="00:52:22.580" style="s2">randomly right those beliefs are</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:24.490" style="s2">selectively structured to build a</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.580" end="00:52:26.920" style="s2">justifying narrative</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.490" end="00:52:29.470" style="s2">yeah hey based on your history and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.920" end="00:52:32.530" style="s2">current context of the social field oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.470" end="00:52:34.330" style="s2">wait he has a child and once you build</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.530" end="00:52:36.550" style="s2">your own self-concept system of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.330" end="00:52:37.930" style="s2">justification that creates an adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.550" end="00:52:41.110" style="s2">level you now have this whole other</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.930" end="00:52:43.300" style="s2">level of well what am i to myself as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.110" end="00:52:46.780" style="s2">dialog with myself at the private law</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.300" end="00:52:48.790" style="s2">right totally yes sir let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.780" end="00:52:50.950" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s internalized and then that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.790" end="00:52:53.650" style="s2">creates the normally the super-ego is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.950" end="00:52:55.300" style="s2">then the interject it was well alright I</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.650" end="00:52:58.330" style="s2">have to internalize all the authority</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.300" end="00:53:02.140" style="s2">instead of me so then I screw up alright</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.330" end="00:53:03.340" style="s2">and so that I punish myself before other</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.140" end="00:53:05.050" style="s2">people do because there&#39;s a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.340" end="00:53:06.670" style="s2">if I punish myself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.050" end="00:53:08.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why people will throw it out</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.670" end="00:53:11.230" style="s2">they&#39;ll throw out the artwork or</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.770" end="00:53:12.580" style="s2">whatever it is yeah God though people</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.230" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">would because nothing would be worse</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.580" end="00:53:18.100" style="s2">than it&#39;s better to not get up on stage</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:19.840" style="s2">then get booed off stage yeah yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.100" end="00:53:21.580" style="s2">stage is really a life threatened you</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.840" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">can at least criticize yourself so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.580" end="00:53:25.750" style="s2">internalize the critic especially for</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.920" end="00:53:28.470" style="s2">folks if you have a particular structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.750" end="00:53:31.720" style="s2">a history I mean do to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.470" end="00:53:33.640" style="s2">Psychopaths 10 that&#39;s another structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.720" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">about why there&#39;s all this individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.640" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">difference but if you have a neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">temperament and you&#39;re somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:40.750" style="s2">conscientious man you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:41.950" style="s2">now internalized the authority and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.750" end="00:53:45.070" style="s2">you&#39;re vulnerable you&#39;ll be walking</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.950" end="00:53:46.570" style="s2">around with that anticipatory judgment</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.070" end="00:53:51.580" style="s2">to other this is the harsh critic</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.570" end="00:53:53.830" style="s2">super-ego I anticipate that yeah so by</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.580" end="00:53:55.869" style="s2">reverse-engineering once you know to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.830" end="00:53:58.330" style="s2">look at the consciousness system from</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.869" end="00:54:00.580" style="s2">the mind - phenomenology okay so that</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.580" end="00:54:05.230" style="s2">yeah trying to get its energy out a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.220" end="00:54:07.690" style="s2">particular way you know the whole eyes</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.230" end="00:54:10.450" style="s2">narrator that has a realistic justifier</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.690" end="00:54:11.770" style="s2">and I did see this all the time if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.450" end="00:54:15.130" style="s2">know anything about family systems</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.770" end="00:54:17.980" style="s2">therapy or any you know basic Eric Byrne</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.130" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">transactional analysis with a child and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.980" end="00:54:22.390" style="s2">a parent and a healthy adult I see this</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:24.790" style="s2">all the time so the healthy adults just</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.390" end="00:54:27.100" style="s2">trying to navigate but then you carry</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.790" end="00:54:29.980" style="s2">around this it&#39;s real critic you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.100" end="00:54:32.470" style="s2">from what burning issue and that filter</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.980" end="00:54:34.450" style="s2">you know and yeah we can reverse</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.470" end="00:54:35.380" style="s2">engineer by saying well what are those</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.450" end="00:54:37.790" style="s2">where did that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.380" end="00:54:40.220" style="s2">what&#39;s that system trying to do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.790" end="00:54:43.160" style="s2">yeah I seen the judgments of authority</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.220" end="00:54:45.770" style="s2">and trying to make sure that your child</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.160" end="00:54:47.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t misbehave because when or screw</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.770" end="00:54:49.300" style="s2">things up because you&#39;ll be punished so</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.420" end="00:54:53.570" style="s2">you&#39;re preemptively doing that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.300" end="00:54:55.700" style="s2">totally totally cool end and then forge</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.570" end="00:54:57.850" style="s2">it yeah and anticipating it projecting</p>

<p begin="00:58:16.579" end="00:58:20.119" style="s2">there&#39;s still the social aspect going I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.530" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">even in the reflection right self</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.119" end="00:58:25.190" style="s2">reflection like getting involved in</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:28.460" style="s2">communities that tell the truth in their</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.190" end="00:58:30.170" style="s2">experience you can start to onion right</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.640" style="s2">actually learn because we have so many</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.329" end="00:58:51.170" style="s2">blind spots we can go for introspection</p>

<p begin="01:01:32.380" end="01:01:36.010" style="s2">decent better of people I can tolerate</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:37.750" style="s2">better be an MP chorus right because so</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.010" end="01:01:40.030" style="s2">many people and then once it&#39;s revealed</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.750" end="01:01:42.010" style="s2">and once you&#39;re humiliated you really in</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.030" end="01:01:43.180" style="s2">it and you know and there&#39;s not trust</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.010" end="01:01:44.800" style="s2">and then all of a sudden you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.180" end="01:01:47.140" style="s2">my god you really think that people</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.800" end="01:01:49.420" style="s2">can&#39;t tolerate and Blake God be very you</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.140" end="01:01:51.250" style="s2">know that is hey that&#39;s our terror our</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.420" end="01:01:53.620" style="s2">terror is the rest people really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.250" end="01:01:56.350" style="s2">love us not and then if you actually saw</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.620" end="01:01:58.330" style="s2">it and felt it and emerge in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.350" end="01:02:00.010" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t metabolize it&#39;s scary</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.330" end="01:02:02.620" style="s2">definitely but if you could do it right</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.010" end="01:02:05.230" style="s2">you build a foundation you get you clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.620" end="01:02:06.940" style="s2">the shadow out yeah foundation of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.230" end="01:02:09.220" style="s2">of connection you actually can talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.940" end="01:02:11.350" style="s2">about you know what&#39;s really going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.220" end="01:02:13.090" style="s2">and if you have that you can then get</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.350" end="01:02:15.990" style="s2">rid of you know cuz so much of it just</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.090" end="01:02:19.180" style="s2">builds up out of a miscommunication yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.990" end="01:02:21.100" style="s2">and it&#39;s all it&#39;s in just a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.180" end="01:02:23.140" style="s2">that and I often thought about them and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.100" end="01:02:24.820" style="s2">I think about this is where I also I</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.140" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">just think the Catholic Church is just</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.820" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">brilliant right with confessions right</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:34.750" style="s2">this this idea of like just the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:38.080" style="s2">the wet or the insight that oh just say</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.750" end="01:02:40.990" style="s2">it like reveal your shame right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.080" end="01:02:43.630" style="s2">like absolutely that revelation is is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.990" end="01:02:45.820" style="s2">is a restoration of some kind now you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.630" end="01:02:47.110" style="s2">know it&#39;s you know guys automatic and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.820" end="01:02:49.930" style="s2">all that stuff but right no but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.110" end="01:02:51.700" style="s2">point of it notice if you from a unified</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.930" end="01:02:53.710" style="s2">theory perspective what we have is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.700" end="01:02:55.090" style="s2">informational interface okay the way to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.710" end="01:02:56.470" style="s2">understand so you have a the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.090" end="01:02:58.660" style="s2">neurocognitive system that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.470" end="01:03:00.790" style="s2">conscious into the cognitive system that</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.660" end="01:03:03.460" style="s2">consciousness system that&#39;s mine too</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.790" end="01:03:05.560" style="s2">okay in a mine three when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.460" end="01:03:07.480" style="s2">rehearsing you have mine to</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.560" end="01:03:10.090" style="s2">bouncing around in the mind one but</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.480" end="01:03:12.550" style="s2">you&#39;re not narrated so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.090" end="01:03:15.190" style="s2">disintegration and it&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.550" end="01:03:17.170" style="s2">just to say to yourself then to actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.190" end="01:03:18.730" style="s2">say it in to what I feel the public mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.170" end="01:03:20.200" style="s2">three space where you actually have</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.730" end="01:03:21.940" style="s2">another person that can hold you</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.200" end="01:03:23.560" style="s2">accountable yeah and of course they</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.940" end="01:03:25.420" style="s2">protect it because it is dangerous when</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.560" end="01:03:27.310" style="s2">we do say in psychotherapy it&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.420" end="01:03:30.570" style="s2">mean so now Mitchell same basic process</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.310" end="01:03:33.810" style="s2">right going you confess your sins</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.570" end="01:03:35.130" style="s2">and and by gaining mirroring about what</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.810" end="01:03:36.750" style="s2">the things that scare you you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.130" end="01:03:38.700" style="s2">actually then start will use mine three</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.750" end="01:03:40.650" style="s2">to work them through and understand</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.700" end="01:03:42.570" style="s2">their inner relations because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.650" end="01:03:44.579" style="s2">building of the narrative end of effect</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.570" end="01:03:48.750" style="s2">that is so crucial it&#39;s that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.579" end="01:03:51.210" style="s2">network bridge and that&#39;s the quality of</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.750" end="01:03:53.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve often thought about you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.210" end="01:03:55.400" style="s2">of times like when that in that private</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.160" end="01:03:57.869" style="s2">conversation with yourself right of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.400" end="01:03:59.579" style="s2">where you&#39;re justifying it with yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.869" end="01:04:01.260" style="s2">but you like you like there&#39;s some place</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.579" end="01:04:03.630" style="s2">that you&#39;re inauthentic out here so</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.260" end="01:04:05.640" style="s2">you&#39;re justifying it I think it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.630" end="01:04:08.339" style="s2">like the motive I often notice like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.640" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">mode of that conversation seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.339" end="01:04:15.839" style="s2">about talking to yourself so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:18.510" style="s2">not caught off guard and surprised right</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.839" end="01:04:20.280" style="s2">wish with whatever it is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.510" end="01:04:22.920" style="s2">messing with you right whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.280" end="01:04:27.780" style="s2">that you&#39;re unsettled about but I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.920" end="01:04:31.079" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the it it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.780" end="01:04:33.480" style="s2">disclosing yourself voluntarily like</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.079" end="01:04:36.300" style="s2">voluntarily subjecting yourself to a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.480" end="01:04:39.000" style="s2">place of risk risky humiliation risking</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.300" end="01:04:41.700" style="s2">every seems to be it seems to be on a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.000" end="01:04:45.470" style="s2">very it&#39;s a completely different thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.700" end="01:04:53.190" style="s2">than if it was revealed by surprise oh</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.470" end="01:04:55.589" style="s2">it&#39;s that volunteerin astray at every</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.190" end="01:04:57.810" style="s2">level at every level so if we think</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.589" end="01:04:59.849" style="s2">about it in this way I mean you can look</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.810" end="01:05:02.490" style="s2">at a brain system that&#39;s in a reactive</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.849" end="01:05:05.339" style="s2">state versus regulated by voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.490" end="01:05:07.410" style="s2">control States okay I mean at a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.339" end="01:05:09.150" style="s2">base level they voluntary control</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.410" end="01:05:12.690" style="s2">behavioral regulation system is very</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.150" end="01:05:14.250" style="s2">different than a reactive yes okay the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.690" end="01:05:15.660" style="s2">active systems are designed to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.250" end="01:05:17.220" style="s2">defensively get you the hell out of</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.660" end="01:05:19.260" style="s2">there because you don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.220" end="01:05:20.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect this and this is an</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.260" end="01:05:23.730" style="s2">absolute threat if you have mean sized</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.910" end="01:05:28.040" style="s2">it up yet right course straight to your</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.730" end="01:05:30.119" style="s2">core fear yeah so an unexpected injury</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.040" end="01:05:31.920" style="s2">it&#39;s designed to send electricity</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.119" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">through your body and for you to jump</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.920" end="01:05:35.339" style="s2">back as far as possible and push</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:39.000" style="s2">everything away that&#39;s coming at you</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.339" end="01:05:41.130" style="s2">right right right now and so like when</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.000" end="01:05:43.170" style="s2">we do phobias you know everything in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.130" end="01:05:46.770" style="s2">faux B treatment</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.170" end="01:05:48.660" style="s2">is get the person&#39;s efficacy into a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.770" end="01:05:52.140" style="s2">place where is that I think I can handle</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.660" end="01:05:53.850" style="s2">this yeah and you know and it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.140" end="01:05:56.280" style="s2">skill is getting that healthy ego to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.850" end="01:05:58.800" style="s2">hey yes I want to confront this I want</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.280" end="01:06:01.320" style="s2">to toll this scary thing about me I want</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.800" end="01:06:04.200" style="s2">to see the picture of the dog okay if</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.320" end="01:06:06.300" style="s2">they don&#39;t have that okay then this</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.200" end="01:06:08.700" style="s2">system they don&#39;t have control so they</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.300" end="01:06:10.380" style="s2">need cognitive adjustable Kotori control</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.700" end="01:06:12.330" style="s2">and ideally behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.380" end="01:06:15.990" style="s2">control and if they&#39;re in that system</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.330" end="01:06:17.670" style="s2">then they can metabolize yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.990" end="01:06:19.110" style="s2">they have a sense of mastery they have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.670" end="01:06:21.750" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re investing and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.110" end="01:06:24.000" style="s2">regulating the system and it can grow if</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.750" end="01:06:25.620" style="s2">their gates the inside you know and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.000" end="01:06:27.720" style="s2">something comes out of the space of you</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.620" end="01:06:30.300" style="s2">you&#39;re just into completely you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.720" end="01:06:33.270" style="s2">you&#39;re a big corner in the dark and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.300" end="01:06:34.800" style="s2">only oddly response is escape and get</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.270" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">this away from you in a Kurtz and why</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.800" end="01:06:39.030" style="s2">would you do to me why would you hurt me</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:42.390" style="s2">so bad in a way that I can understand so</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.030" end="01:06:43.340" style="s2">that inability metabolize it just makes</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.390" end="01:06:46.050" style="s2">it worse</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.340" end="01:06:50.700" style="s2">terrified with a whole nother layer of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.050" end="01:06:53.430" style="s2">fear yeah yes I&#39;m just appreciating kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.700" end="01:06:55.680" style="s2">of like the frame like how a lot of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.430" end="01:06:57.300" style="s2">stuff is is you&#39;re it&#39;s so integrated</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.680" end="01:07:00.330" style="s2">into this system it just makes so much</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.300" end="01:07:03.210" style="s2">sense there&#39;s also kind of made sense in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.330" end="01:07:05.370" style="s2">the way of like one of the like one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.210" end="01:07:07.890" style="s2">the issues I&#39;ve had around around</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.370" end="01:07:11.910" style="s2">circling in the greater community of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.890" end="01:07:17.490" style="s2">right is cuz whenever this whenever this</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.910" end="01:07:21.350" style="s2">kind of confrontational like like psych</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.490" end="01:07:24.480" style="s2">like the it feels like remnants of of</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.350" end="01:07:26.520" style="s2">the of you know encounter groups and</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.480" end="01:07:30.570" style="s2">stuff like that where it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.520" end="01:07:32.040" style="s2">aggressions just like let to go I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.570" end="01:07:36.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s something in me that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.040" end="01:07:38.460" style="s2">just seems it just I I it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.630" end="01:07:41.160" style="s2">cringes inside because it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.460" end="01:07:43.830" style="s2">actually my experience of that know</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.160" end="01:07:46.110" style="s2">there&#39;s what this takes is a virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.830" end="01:07:50.010" style="s2">reverence right I think that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.110" end="01:07:54.120" style="s2">practice of circling essentially is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.010" end="01:07:56.810" style="s2">really encouraging cultivating and how</p>

<p begin="01:09:09.950" end="01:09:15.530" style="s2">contained I think your board reverence</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.569" end="01:09:17.510" style="s2">is unbelievably key yeah so to me what</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.530" end="01:09:20.150" style="s2">that goes to is just is the experience</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.510" end="01:09:22.370" style="s2">of relational value that each person at</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.150" end="01:09:24.230" style="s2">the core the core of their true self</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.370" end="01:09:27.230" style="s2">which seeks to be known and valued right</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.230" end="01:09:29.210" style="s2">to be held and if we&#39;re holding that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.230" end="01:09:30.710" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a space in which that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.210" end="01:09:34.900" style="s2">actually threatened in the trust is</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.710" end="01:09:37.280" style="s2">broken on that then drop into defense</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.900" end="01:09:40.040" style="s2">exactly for the constructive circling</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.280" end="01:09:42.319" style="s2">process to Annapolis yeah so so you</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.040" end="01:09:44.390" style="s2">that&#39;s a rule that&#39;s a bit you know do</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:47.690" style="s2">you want to becomes if the old circling</p>

<p begin="01:09:47.690" end="01:09:52.640" style="s2">then that&#39;s a you have to have the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.400" end="01:09:54.260" style="s2">reference principle yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.640" end="01:09:59.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.260" end="01:10:01.370" style="s2">if it is um in the ability to become in</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.180" end="01:10:03.020" style="s2">reverence for somebody seems to be about</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.370" end="01:10:05.180" style="s2">because reverence my understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.020" end="01:10:08.450" style="s2">reverence is what makes it reverence is</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.180" end="01:10:11.410" style="s2">it implicitly is recognizes that when</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.450" end="01:10:13.780" style="s2">your own limitations right</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.410" end="01:10:17.620" style="s2">and being faced with something that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.780" end="01:10:19.900" style="s2">has so much like a beyond this right did</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.620" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">I conquer right that&#39;s where it leaves</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.900" end="01:10:23.530" style="s2">like reverence leads to aw so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:25.780" style="s2">that sense of more Ness right so being</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.530" end="01:10:29.080" style="s2">able to look at somebody in contacting</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.780" end="01:10:32.230" style="s2">reverence means you&#39;re contacting not</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.080" end="01:10:35.050" style="s2">your your judgments or assertions about</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.230" end="01:10:36.730" style="s2">who somebody is but like precisely that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.050" end="01:10:40.660" style="s2">you&#39;re contacting the mystery that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.730" end="01:10:42.550" style="s2">are right right everyone every if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.660" end="01:10:46.390" style="s2">looking at the universe that&#39;s available</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.550" end="01:10:48.910" style="s2">right is the spiritual dimension right</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.390" end="01:10:50.920" style="s2">then that for me then that hooks into</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.910" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">the spiritual dimension you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.920" end="01:10:57.100" style="s2">ultimate concern and what ultimate value</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:59.320" style="s2">structures right that then guide us okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.100" end="01:11:03.610" style="s2">so I have a said I had a saying that</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.320" end="01:11:05.560" style="s2">says be Heidegger insensitive work that</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.610" end="01:11:09.190" style="s2">which enhances dignity and well-being</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.560" end="01:11:11.800" style="s2">with integrity right right so where by</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.190" end="01:11:15.880" style="s2">dignity and well-being and integrity are</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.800" end="01:11:19.120" style="s2">my big three values stronger yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.880" end="01:11:20.650" style="s2">and and I mean and for me then reverence</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.120" end="01:11:22.150" style="s2">gets into the date of the whole things</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.650" end="01:11:24.940" style="s2">reverence but it&#39;s about dignity is</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.150" end="01:11:27.460" style="s2">about the beauty and respect of each of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.940" end="01:11:27.790" style="s2">us individually right humanity as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.460" end="01:11:31.900" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.790" end="01:11:34.060" style="s2">yeah yeah and as that is having</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.900" end="01:11:37.570" style="s2">reverence for that human as a whole and</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.060" end="01:11:41.020" style="s2">each of us individually right from an</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.570" end="01:11:42.150" style="s2">honor toward right give honor to right</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.020" end="01:11:45.310" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.150" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">holiness team and I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.310" end="01:11:50.230" style="s2">though that level of perception and</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:53.320" style="s2">cultivating that this is where I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.230" end="01:11:54.820" style="s2">that people start to use I mean John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.320" end="01:11:57.190" style="s2">talked about this it&#39;s been fun having</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.820" end="01:11:59.620" style="s2">John go to circling and in hearing his</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.190" end="01:12:01.929" style="s2">observations about like from his life</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.620" end="01:12:03.190" style="s2">right yeah you know about one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.929" end="01:12:05.620" style="s2">things he picked up on right away was</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.190" end="01:12:07.690" style="s2">this kind of like this like circling is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.620" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">a secular by definition it&#39;s a secular</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.690" end="01:12:12.850" style="s2">process but people have the experience</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.719" end="01:12:14.820" style="s2">of these very spiritual experiences and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.850" end="01:12:17.590" style="s2">use this kind of spiritual language</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.820" end="01:12:20.580" style="s2">right and I think a lot of it has to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.590" end="01:12:24.320" style="s2">with it&#39;s because you&#39;re continually</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.580" end="01:12:26.750" style="s2">voluntarily like listening to the other</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.320" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">right in their humanity in disclosing</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.750" end="01:12:31.610" style="s2">yourself and you&#39;re getting that</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.400" end="01:12:34.579" style="s2">autopoietic process right that you start</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.610" end="01:12:37.780" style="s2">to touch into this sense of on one level</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.579" end="01:12:41.150" style="s2">the person&#39;s unique once the current</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.780" end="01:12:43.969" style="s2">suchness essence or something like that</p>

<p begin="01:12:43.969" end="01:12:49.730" style="s2">becomes transparent to this like the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.520" end="01:12:53.540" style="s2">kind of an a fountain of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.730" end="01:12:56.570" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond all of us that starts to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.540" end="01:12:58.159" style="s2">move into the conversation right we</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.570" end="01:13:00.610" style="s2">start to experience it people have</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.159" end="01:13:04.190" style="s2">experience that is like a spiritual</p>

<p begin="01:15:29.300" end="01:15:32.990" style="s2">create a theory of knowledge you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.580" end="01:15:34.670" style="s2">then I would say hey this is gonna be</p>

<p begin="01:15:40.240" end="01:15:46.430" style="s2">you know so my identity it&#39;s been a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.730" end="01:15:50.000" style="s2">interesting you know experience because</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.430" end="01:15:54.500" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the in terms of the short</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.000" end="01:15:55.820" style="s2">developmental narrative I got I was I</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.500" end="01:15:56.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t care might read school in high</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.820" end="01:15:58.610" style="s2">school you know I did well enough</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.750" end="01:16:01.640" style="s2">amounted to James Madison where I ended</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.610" end="01:16:03.890" style="s2">up returning as a professor and then I</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.640" end="01:16:06.550" style="s2">got I found that I had some interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.890" end="01:16:11.240" style="s2">capacities to understand things</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.550" end="01:16:13.190" style="s2">undergrad but good I could quickly learn</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.240" end="01:16:16.070" style="s2">arguments that people were making and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.190" end="01:16:18.860" style="s2">had basically a quasi level reading</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.070" end="01:16:21.230" style="s2">disability so I didn&#39;t read much then</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.860" end="01:16:22.820" style="s2">and then I got and then I could realize</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.230" end="01:16:24.710" style="s2">I understood then I got curious actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.820" end="01:16:28.910" style="s2">feminism is my first intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.710" end="01:16:31.960" style="s2">awakening and sociology I got I realized</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.910" end="01:16:34.490" style="s2">that actually I&#39;m one of four boys and</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.960" end="01:16:35.660" style="s2">although my parents were relatively</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.490" end="01:16:37.670" style="s2">enlightened there was definitely a</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.660" end="01:16:40.220" style="s2">significant gender power differential</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.670" end="01:16:42.410" style="s2">between them and that I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.220" end="01:16:45.230" style="s2">been aware of until I took a feminist</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.410" end="01:16:47.030" style="s2">and sociology class her basically was</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.230" end="01:16:49.040" style="s2">like you know the whole structure of</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.030" end="01:16:54.590" style="s2">narrative here is biased</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.040" end="01:16:56.300" style="s2">right really see that before right now</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.590" end="01:16:58.340" style="s2">what applies didn&#39;t I brought that home</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.300" end="01:17:00.110" style="s2">to my mom who was also sort of waking up</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.340" end="01:17:02.740" style="s2">to another layer of feminism in her we</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.110" end="01:17:07.520" style="s2">actually bonded around that yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.740" end="01:17:09.200" style="s2">then I went into graduate school and by</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.520" end="01:17:11.150" style="s2">that time I was actually I started to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.200" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">able to absorb a lot pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.150" end="01:17:15.470" style="s2">I got really fortunate my Master&#39;s I had</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:17.840" style="s2">terminal masters in clinical community</p>

<p begin="01:17:34.970" end="01:17:39.200" style="s2">County my thesis advisor and rich</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.220" end="01:17:41.930" style="s2">Tedeschi was my advanced psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.200" end="01:17:43.580" style="s2">professor he was a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.930" end="01:17:46.040" style="s2">psychotherapist they were both wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.580" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">mentors and he was able to give me a</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.040" end="01:17:50.120" style="s2">deep appreciation for those to practice</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:54.260" style="s2">in the paradigm of the major approaches</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.120" end="01:17:56.810" style="s2">yeah so this is 1994 and then I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.260" end="01:17:58.790" style="s2">wow you know I used to be CDT because I</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.810" end="01:18:01.490" style="s2">was the sort of empiricist psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.790" end="01:18:03.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean yes okay which I</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.490" end="01:18:05.090" style="s2">thought empirical well that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.080" end="01:18:06.440" style="s2">right way to go because actual science</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.090" end="01:18:08.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what real truth is all this other</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.440" end="01:18:10.730" style="s2">one yes you know what Hey</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.420" end="01:18:11.450" style="s2">then I was like man you know you look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.730" end="01:18:13.400" style="s2">all this other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.450" end="01:18:15.200" style="s2">Freud maybe wasn&#39;t so crazy boy did</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.400" end="01:18:16.940" style="s2">Rogers gonna have him a lot right and</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.200" end="01:18:18.800" style="s2">you know the same people and actually I</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.940" end="01:18:20.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t had a supervisor that wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.800" end="01:18:22.640" style="s2">effective from a cognitive perspective</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.060" end="01:18:24.290" style="s2">and so I just sort of like woke up to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.640" end="01:18:26.300" style="s2">the fact that these paradigms in</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.290" end="01:18:28.850" style="s2">psychotherapy all have brilliant things</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.300" end="01:18:30.350" style="s2">to say you know if I went done by the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.850" end="01:18:31.310" style="s2">best of the best you listen to him</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.350" end="01:18:35.810" style="s2">you&#39;re like yeah they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.310" end="01:18:37.790" style="s2">something yeah so so then I&#39;m in man</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.810" end="01:18:39.560" style="s2">then like I said what&#39;s Mike one of my</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.790" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">ways of thinking that sort of had a</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.560" end="01:18:46.130" style="s2">talent amount is jump back and cohere</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:47.950" style="s2">back in kobir and so and that was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.130" end="01:18:52.190" style="s2">perfect intersection between</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.950" end="01:18:54.980" style="s2">psychotherapy and it&#39;s complex chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.190" end="01:18:57.410" style="s2">paradigms with all 15 things so I jump</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.980" end="01:19:00.090" style="s2">back to take a look at them and say well</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.410" end="01:19:01.380" style="s2">why don&#39;t they go here yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.090" end="01:19:05.639" style="s2">my first problem is the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.380" end="01:19:07.530" style="s2">psychotherapy right hey hey right so</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.639" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">then when I did that I was like but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.530" end="01:19:12.989" style="s2">knew that psychotherapy was a value</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.840" end="01:19:15.599" style="s2">based enterprise yeah other words if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.989" end="01:19:18.030" style="s2">care about truth or do you happiness</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.599" end="01:19:19.230" style="s2">know right well if you care about truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.030" end="01:19:20.909" style="s2">care about happiness those are two</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.230" end="01:19:22.260" style="s2">different things you yeoreum one inside</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.909" end="01:19:24.270" style="s2">of yourself you know do you care about</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.260" end="01:19:26.580" style="s2">systems and justice what do you care</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.270" end="01:19:29.639" style="s2">about all right so the difference like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.580" end="01:19:31.349" style="s2">therapies so then I was like well then I</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.639" end="01:19:33.239" style="s2">asked moved from well what about</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.349" end="01:19:35.730" style="s2">psychotherapy to at least have simpler</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.239" end="01:19:38.840" style="s2">questions what about psychology if if</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.730" end="01:19:40.800" style="s2">modern day biology is the applied</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.840" end="01:19:43.639" style="s2">application of biomedical engineering</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.800" end="01:19:47.400" style="s2">kinds of stuff based on human biology</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.639" end="01:19:50.310" style="s2">why psychotherapy be based on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.400" end="01:19:53.790" style="s2">science of psychology yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.310" end="01:19:58.619" style="s2">and so 1995 1996 I made that jump and</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.790" end="01:20:00.989" style="s2">that&#39;s when I really knew it was like</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.619" end="01:20:03.090" style="s2">that&#39;s when it started to dawn amis it</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.989" end="01:20:04.139" style="s2">was not a coherent discipline right</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.090" end="01:20:06.900" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.139" end="01:20:08.489" style="s2">I actually fell in love for two years</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.900" end="01:20:09.960" style="s2">with evolutionary psychology the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.489" end="01:20:13.080" style="s2">academic discipline of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.960" end="01:20:15.420" style="s2">psychology impress I own up on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.080" end="01:20:16.920" style="s2">feminists some of the early way feminist</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.420" end="01:20:18.510" style="s2">stuff about that was very</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.920" end="01:20:19.800" style="s2">environmentalism was like well if you</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.510" end="01:20:21.210" style="s2">believe in evolutionary theory and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.800" end="01:20:32.849" style="s2">gender differences you&#39;re basically a</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.210" end="01:20:35.639" style="s2">Nazi and this is not just science of all</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.849" end="01:20:38.250" style="s2">exam so I fell in love with evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.639" end="01:20:41.610" style="s2">theory while a lot of my friends were</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.250" end="01:20:43.650" style="s2">pretty skeptical of that but I then sort</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.610" end="01:20:45.300" style="s2">of then disappeared into my own world</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.650" end="01:20:47.219" style="s2">and by that time I was my reading</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.300" end="01:20:49.889" style="s2">disorder was gone and I was chewing up a</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.219" end="01:20:54.060" style="s2">lot of information well turned into a</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.889" end="01:20:56.610" style="s2">bookworm by 96 so I went to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.060" end="01:20:58.770" style="s2">University of Vermont to study but</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.610" end="01:21:01.409" style="s2">basically I was just now on my own</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.770" end="01:21:04.530" style="s2">autodidactic I was just on my own right</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.409" end="01:21:07.830" style="s2">shooing up everything I could when I</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.530" end="01:21:09.570" style="s2">trained in my dissertation was I did a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.830" end="01:21:11.040" style="s2">social psych stuff for my master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.570" end="01:21:13.620" style="s2">degree that my dissertation was on</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:16.290" style="s2">Beck&#39;s cognitive errors</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.620" end="01:21:18.900" style="s2">and I got trained in psychodynamic work</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.290" end="01:21:20.610" style="s2">by really well and and I was reading up</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.900" end="01:21:25.650" style="s2">on evolutionary theory and so this was</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.610" end="01:21:30.270" style="s2">1996 99 and then that&#39;s when the insight</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.650" end="01:21:32.580" style="s2">about justification happened and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.270" end="01:21:35.490" style="s2">had the evolutionary analysis of Freud&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.580" end="01:21:36.840" style="s2">key insight yeah and then I was for six</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.490" end="01:21:39.210" style="s2">months I was just obsessed with that</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.840" end="01:21:41.700" style="s2">once you see people as justify errs you</p>

<p begin="01:21:50.250" end="01:21:55.590" style="s2">would release some you know constraints</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:59.630" style="s2">and allow me to be creative and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.590" end="01:22:02.190" style="s2">sometime in the fall of 1997 I was</p>

<p begin="01:23:01.860" end="01:23:04.830" style="s2">clear to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.640" end="01:23:06.930" style="s2">okay and what mine what had happened in</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.000" end="01:23:15.090" style="s2">hid it and had over do not reproduce or</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.790" end="01:23:17.520" style="s2">or you know without permission I thought</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.090" end="01:23:19.380" style="s2">that if somebody like yo Wilson suniye</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.520" end="01:23:22.590" style="s2">Wilson produced the book of conciliate</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.380" end="01:23:25.860" style="s2">the unity of knowledge in 1998 I think a</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.590" end="01:23:27.300" style="s2">one after and I was in the impression of</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.860" end="01:23:29.100" style="s2">he saw that he would immediately</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.300" end="01:23:31.560" style="s2">be able to see that this is the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.100" end="01:23:34.080" style="s2">formula and so I was working on it for a</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.560" end="01:23:37.200" style="s2">year without telling hardly anybody</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.080" end="01:23:38.970" style="s2">other than my family yeah private and</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.200" end="01:23:40.560" style="s2">then I built it to a point where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.970" end="01:23:43.860" style="s2">ready to share it I sent it to like</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.560" end="01:23:46.920" style="s2">Richard Dawkins yo Wilson yeah her and</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.860" end="01:23:51.270" style="s2">Dan Dennett I know one word back from</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.920" end="01:23:54.030" style="s2">Dan Daniel unsurprising right right and</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.270" end="01:23:57.060" style="s2">and so everybody just you know is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.030" end="01:23:59.640" style="s2">total opposite reaction I was convinced</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.060" end="01:24:01.980" style="s2">that this was a totally transformational</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.640" end="01:24:06.420" style="s2">way of seeing it yeah they just shrugged</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.980" end="01:24:10.190" style="s2">it off it was not seen as meaningful or</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.420" end="01:24:13.190" style="s2">novel or useful what was that like for</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.190" end="01:24:13.190" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.630" end="01:24:22.290" style="s2">yeah sorry really transformational I the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.550" end="01:24:24.300" style="s2">thing that happened to my ego and we can</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.290" end="01:24:28.230" style="s2">you know in terms of my own self sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.300" end="01:24:29.760" style="s2">of so that started in 1995 and really I</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.230" end="01:24:32.340" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a night where all of our egos</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.760" end="01:24:33.060" style="s2">Ronco but I am in your period of dealing</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.340" end="01:24:37.290" style="s2">with this thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.060" end="01:24:39.720" style="s2">yeah because well you I mean I literally</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.290" end="01:24:41.550" style="s2">think I built a theory not just of</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.720" end="01:24:44.190" style="s2">psychology but of scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.550" end="01:24:47.250" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s really a treat now is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.190" end="01:24:49.740" style="s2">scientific knowledge right well do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.250" end="01:24:53.220" style="s2">think you built a theory of scientific</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.740" end="01:24:54.900" style="s2">knowledge RIT law right right all&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.220" end="01:24:58.760" style="s2">problem was of the Enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.900" end="01:25:02.400" style="s2">sets the stage for the 21st century now</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.760" end="01:25:06.600" style="s2">I mean you know the guy next to us yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:10.980" style="s2">yeah totally totally yeah yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.600" end="01:25:12.960" style="s2">an unusual belief to have right I have</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.980" end="01:25:15.960" style="s2">that belief and I know what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.960" end="01:25:20.040" style="s2">believe it and it creates weird dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.960" end="01:25:22.290" style="s2">yeah yeah so for example my father&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.040" end="01:25:24.060" style="s2">history professor you know any early</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.290" end="01:25:26.490" style="s2">conservative and traditional not never</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.060" end="01:25:30.510" style="s2">democratic honey no no political sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.490" end="01:25:33.420" style="s2">but in a defers to the authority yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.510" end="01:25:34.890" style="s2">and and he saw me rightfully in many</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.420" end="01:25:36.750" style="s2">ways is not very bright so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.890" end="01:25:38.970" style="s2">always been early because my learning</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.750" end="01:25:41.060" style="s2">disability and then I blossom but the</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.970" end="01:25:44.210" style="s2">idea that his son would have done this</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.060" end="01:25:47.960" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t know history well what do</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.210" end="01:25:50.360" style="s2">with the experts say Oh God yeah so my</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.960" end="01:25:52.730" style="s2">argument is well dad once then once the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.360" end="01:25:54.950" style="s2">experts see this thing they will</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.730" end="01:25:58.430" style="s2">obviously have this store that people</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.950" end="01:26:00.110" style="s2">have - okay yeah yeah for a year and</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.430" end="01:26:02.330" style="s2">then we send it to the experts you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.110" end="01:26:05.450" style="s2">and actually kindly he gave me a gift</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.330" end="01:26:07.610" style="s2">for do Wilson he offered it we rose from</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.450" end="01:26:09.050" style="s2">a thousand dollars for an hour of his</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.610" end="01:26:11.200" style="s2">time so that I could show him the tree</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.050" end="01:26:11.200" style="s2">of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.560" end="01:26:16.610" style="s2">so I sent it out to all these people in</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.880" end="01:26:18.110" style="s2">like 1999 or whatever and just you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.610" end="01:26:19.880" style="s2">got an email back remember Wilson well</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.110" end="01:26:22.490" style="s2">I&#39;ll see what it&#39;s a prick I was like</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.880" end="01:26:26.240" style="s2">well we&#39;ll see Hey right everyone just</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.490" end="01:26:27.980" style="s2">you know said no and I need traction I</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.240" end="01:26:30.590" style="s2">talked I talked to the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.980" end="01:26:33.160" style="s2">psychology people so no one cared I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.590" end="01:26:38.570" style="s2">nobody saw it as anything meaning</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.160" end="01:26:40.720" style="s2">so by 2000 now I want to get that like</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.570" end="01:26:43.580" style="s2">well a couple of things it&#39;s like one I</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.720" end="01:26:46.730" style="s2">first of all like you know I just want</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.580" end="01:26:51.800" style="s2">to acknowledge the sense I I think what</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.730" end="01:26:53.330" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing great is that you&#39;re so so</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.800" end="01:26:55.430" style="s2">as you&#39;re talking I can tell I could</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.330" end="01:26:56.780" style="s2">tell like that that this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.430" end="01:27:01.310" style="s2">something you do with your whole being</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.780" end="01:27:03.470" style="s2">right like it&#39;s it&#39;s like this this in</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.310" end="01:27:04.310" style="s2">it and I also I can appreciate you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.470" end="01:27:06.470" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about learning</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.310" end="01:27:08.350" style="s2">disabilities and stuff like I had a tons</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.470" end="01:27:14.230" style="s2">of them I didn&#39;t even know I had any</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.350" end="01:27:14.230" style="s2">intellectual anything I was so many</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.730" end="01:27:24.290" style="s2">totally yeah I think it is um</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.320" end="01:27:26.300" style="s2">and but that sense of like what I kind</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.290" end="01:27:29.090" style="s2">of what I kind of can imagine I just</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.300" end="01:27:31.700" style="s2">kept getting this picture of something</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.090" end="01:27:34.910" style="s2">was speaking to you right and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.700" end="01:27:36.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it was beyond the horizon but as</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.910" end="01:27:38.210" style="s2">you started moving towards it and it</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.620" end="01:27:41.120" style="s2">started shaping you you started to</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.210" end="01:27:42.590" style="s2">discover it right and and this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.120" end="01:27:46.610" style="s2">the things this is one of the mysteries</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.590" end="01:27:49.310" style="s2">to me right I&#39;m fascinated with is like</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.610" end="01:27:53.750" style="s2">how do we know to be struck by something</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.310" end="01:27:54.559" style="s2">before we understand what&#39;s worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.750" end="01:27:58.309" style="s2">being struck by</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.559" end="01:28:00.770" style="s2">right I&#39;m invited right that mystery is</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.309" end="01:28:05.239" style="s2">this place where things like philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.770" end="01:28:09.550" style="s2">and and and it it becomes the trans</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.239" end="01:28:14.389" style="s2">rational in that way completely but also</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.550" end="01:28:16.699" style="s2">deeply personal right so deeply personal</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.389" end="01:28:18.559" style="s2">so just in the sense of just you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.699" end="01:28:20.239" style="s2">writing it all down and then just having</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.559" end="01:28:23.389" style="s2">the wherewithal being uh keeping it</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.239" end="01:28:25.280" style="s2">really private like you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.389" end="01:28:32.230" style="s2">putting it out and oh my god I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.280" end="01:28:34.429" style="s2">trying to imagine what that I went it</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.230" end="01:28:37.280" style="s2">was super interesting because I only</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.429" end="01:28:38.900" style="s2">will a stood twelve can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.280" end="01:28:41.989" style="s2">someone telling 1012 sessions and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.900" end="01:28:45.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t go into it at first okay</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.989" end="01:28:47.119" style="s2">I had this therapist any and I left two</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.500" end="01:28:49.309" style="s2">sessions a session after a massive</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.119" end="01:28:49.969" style="s2">empathetic failure with my therapist on</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.309" end="01:28:55.010" style="s2">this issue</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.969" end="01:28:58.239" style="s2">okay 1898 1999 and yes I&#39;m glad eyes I</p>

<p begin="01:28:58.239" end="01:29:02.980" style="s2">but people didn&#39;t get I mean you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.949" end="01:29:05.360" style="s2">get what I was happening to over this</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.980" end="01:29:08.119" style="s2">period and really a ten-year period</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.360" end="01:29:11.380" style="s2">before I actually came to terms back to</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.119" end="01:29:13.699" style="s2">my dad all the work that need to be done</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.380" end="01:29:15.860" style="s2">but by this on the right in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.699" end="01:29:17.570" style="s2">of it okay and I have basically sent it</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.860" end="01:29:19.610" style="s2">out a few times and gotten some feedback</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.570" end="01:29:22.880" style="s2">and people aren&#39;t having the reaction</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.610" end="01:29:25.340" style="s2">and because it&#39;s a mindfuck you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.880" end="01:29:28.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a complete blank box so you have no</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.340" end="01:29:31.250" style="s2">idea as to whether or not you&#39;re because</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.639" end="01:29:33.230" style="s2">you have your narcissistic urge yeah hey</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.250" end="01:29:34.909" style="s2">are you seeing this thing so clearly and</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.230" end="01:29:38.030" style="s2">no one else is seeing it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.909" end="01:29:39.679" style="s2">any sense and it convinced people who</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.030" end="01:29:42.230" style="s2">should be able to be convinced why this</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.679" end="01:29:44.389" style="s2">is novel I mean I thought I now</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.230" end="01:29:46.670" style="s2">understand it so much clearer but back</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.389" end="01:29:47.929" style="s2">then it was a mystery so I&#39;m in therapy</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.670" end="01:29:49.639" style="s2">and I start talking you know and then by</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.929" end="01:29:52.340" style="s2">my sixth session I really actually say</p>

<p begin="01:32:14.500" end="01:32:19.870" style="s2">actually can in a certain sense you</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.350" end="01:32:21.520" style="s2">you&#39;re the very thing they</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.870" end="01:32:24.790" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t get anyone to really see</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.520" end="01:32:27.220" style="s2">right which on some level I like to me</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.790" end="01:32:30.520" style="s2">that kind of probably in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.220" end="01:32:33.070" style="s2">is being seen right in that in that like</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.520" end="01:32:36.640" style="s2">you know that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.070" end="01:32:38.110" style="s2">something really deep when that when</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.640" end="01:32:41.620" style="s2">people don&#39;t have the categories to</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.110" end="01:32:43.840" style="s2">understand it or comprehend it like but</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.620" end="01:32:45.880" style="s2">yet you have but you but you&#39;re very the</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.840" end="01:32:48.040" style="s2">very system that you&#39;ve got even created</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.880" end="01:32:55.570" style="s2">like it a certain sense perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.040" end="01:32:58.030" style="s2">explains right like right because it was</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.570" end="01:32:59.860" style="s2">I did see that completely in retrospect</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.030" end="01:33:01.090" style="s2">now I in fact something like the blue</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.860" end="01:33:02.680" style="s2">church you know if you follow like</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.090" end="01:33:04.740" style="s2">Jordan Paul&#39;s work in terms well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.680" end="01:33:06.670" style="s2">the church is such a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.740" end="01:33:08.980" style="s2">articulation of the institutional</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.670" end="01:33:10.990" style="s2">inertia infrastructure and logic</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.980" end="01:33:12.670" style="s2">justification system that now flows</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.990" end="01:33:15.460" style="s2">everything and this is so transformative</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.670" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like the digital from non digital I</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.460" end="01:33:19.720" style="s2">mean it really and the structure has no</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:21.160" style="s2">idea so what in and this was happening</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.720" end="01:33:22.450" style="s2">all the time individuals would see it</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.160" end="01:33:25.320" style="s2">but there&#39;s no way that the system could</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.450" end="01:33:28.390" style="s2">digest it and be transformed yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.320" end="01:33:30.970" style="s2">so in a retrospect I see it but as when</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.390" end="01:33:32.890" style="s2">I was twenty eight twenty nine and had</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.970" end="01:33:35.500" style="s2">my dad inside me and wonder rose it was</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.890" end="01:33:38.260" style="s2">not easy you know stuff it was that</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.500" end="01:33:40.210" style="s2">whole you&#39;re alone and and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.260" end="01:33:44.890" style="s2">aware of that and I&#39;m also very aware</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.210" end="01:33:48.310" style="s2">the system tells me I&#39;m a justifier yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.890" end="01:33:50.590" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s a it was you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.310" end="01:33:53.890" style="s2">so then I shifted like in 2000 I shifted</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.590" end="01:33:55.000" style="s2">strategy and started writing and I was</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.890" end="01:33:57.700" style="s2">like okay I have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.000" end="01:34:00.910" style="s2">write this thing you know it had this</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.700" end="01:34:02.590" style="s2">image like in 2001 of the joint points</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.910" end="01:34:03.940" style="s2">and I was learning I was getting</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.590" end="01:34:05.530" style="s2">behavioral investment theory I had</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.940" end="01:34:07.420" style="s2">justification and the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.530" end="01:34:09.130" style="s2">and the influence matrix although I</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.420" end="01:34:12.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t call it that at the time but I</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.130" end="01:34:16.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t write had the life to mind point</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.310" end="01:34:17.560" style="s2">clarified yeah okay got you yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.180" end="01:34:18.970" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that Claire I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.560" end="01:34:20.860" style="s2">the right language for that and I was</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.970" end="01:34:23.110" style="s2">actually on a clinical science listserv</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.860" end="01:34:25.030" style="s2">yeah um and there was a guy who I in</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.110" end="01:34:26.650" style="s2">retrospect very appreciated although I</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.030" end="01:34:28.240" style="s2">was in a you know a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.650" end="01:34:30.480" style="s2">justifying battles with them back in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.240" end="01:34:33.550" style="s2">days of Lister I&#39;d get on there</p>

<p begin="01:34:39.820" end="01:34:45.490" style="s2">digested Skinner from the vantage point</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.530" end="01:34:47.890" style="s2">of economists okay yeah damn it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.490" end="01:34:50.680" style="s2">any at some level and I item</p>

<p begin="01:34:50.680" end="01:34:56.080" style="s2">the stereotypes so then I engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.660" end="01:34:57.730" style="s2">this really deep conversation mmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.080" end="01:34:59.430" style="s2">gone and then was like well now I</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.730" end="01:35:02.740" style="s2">actually have to learn Skinner</p>

<p begin="01:35:32.380" end="01:35:36.970" style="s2">tier selection system is my life</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.110" end="01:35:39.490" style="s2">emergent out of matter my diversion at a</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.970" end="01:35:41.200" style="s2">culture called it&#39;s like I think culture</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.490" end="01:35:43.660" style="s2">my income annihilation and culture</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.200" end="01:35:45.790" style="s2">coming out of mine he&#39;s verbal selection</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.660" end="01:35:48.240" style="s2">lines up with justification his operon</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.790" end="01:35:51.580" style="s2">theory lines up with mind and his</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.240" end="01:35:53.650" style="s2">recognition of evolutionary theory so</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.580" end="01:35:55.150" style="s2">this is like oh my god and then I got</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.650" end="01:35:57.100" style="s2">more and clear about why what his</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.150" end="01:36:00.370" style="s2">philosophy was and how he totally you</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.100" end="01:36:02.620" style="s2">know his philosophy of behaviors so that</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.370" end="01:36:04.150" style="s2">was like in 2000 with that piece so then</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.620" end="01:36:05.590" style="s2">I was like and then I collapsed that</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.150" end="01:36:07.690" style="s2">into what called behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.590" end="01:36:10.030" style="s2">theory and I saw how the system</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.690" end="01:36:13.540" style="s2">assimilated integrated Skinner and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.030" end="01:36:16.330" style="s2"> science functionalist of you okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.540" end="01:36:18.820" style="s2">so then I that was my first paper then</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.330" end="01:36:20.680" style="s2">then I had I could fuse the tree of</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.820" end="01:36:22.300" style="s2">knowledge to show how we could go to</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.680" end="01:36:23.050" style="s2">physics to biology relatively</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.300" end="01:36:26.080" style="s2">well-organized</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.050" end="01:36:27.850" style="s2">and make chaos right and then you and</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.080" end="01:36:30.010" style="s2">then in American psychology at least you</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.850" end="01:36:32.890" style="s2">can then say to most influential people</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.010" end="01:36:34.750" style="s2">are Skinner and Freud once you consider</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.890" end="01:36:37.600" style="s2">how diametrically opposed they are yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.750" end="01:36:39.070" style="s2">okay yeah and then psychology are you</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.600" end="01:36:41.440" style="s2">gonna be a behavior it&#39;s like Skinner or</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.070" end="01:36:42.690" style="s2">analysts like Freud and those super</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.440" end="01:36:45.400" style="s2">influential with their</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.690" end="01:36:48.250" style="s2">yeah well then I was like I can take</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.400" end="01:36:50.170" style="s2">Skinner and link him here yeah if to</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.250" end="01:36:52.570" style="s2">mine and I take Freud and put them here</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.170" end="01:36:56.320" style="s2">right I have life mine culture on a</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.570" end="01:36:59.920" style="s2">biopsychosocial right yeah we have the</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.320" end="01:37:02.020" style="s2">whole thing comes online this cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.920" end="01:37:03.760" style="s2">developmental view that a PHA and all</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.020" end="01:37:07.360" style="s2">the sudden taking the extremes put them</p>

<p begin="01:39:02.830" end="01:39:07.690" style="s2">of Pennsylvania and there were some</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.800" end="01:39:09.550" style="s2">interest and I got to special issues I</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.690" end="01:39:12.160" style="s2">got my job and I got to special issues</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.550" end="01:39:14.320" style="s2">in uncle psychology and had a few</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.160" end="01:39:16.270" style="s2">conferences and there was some momentum</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.320" end="01:39:18.820" style="s2">in the mid 2000s</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.270" end="01:39:20.470" style="s2">right there was interest in people</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.820" end="01:39:21.120" style="s2">commented on it and I thought that we</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.470" end="01:39:23.650" style="s2">might get</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.120" end="01:39:25.420" style="s2">but then the inter this is when I ran</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.650" end="01:39:27.070" style="s2">into the institutional problem everybody</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.420" end="01:39:29.530" style="s2">has so many different reactions to it</p>

<p begin="01:39:29.530" end="01:39:32.470" style="s2">like this piece I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.240" end="01:39:34.600" style="s2">apply and I don&#39;t know how to speak the</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.470" end="01:39:36.970" style="s2">whole language so everybody sees it from</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.600" end="01:39:40.450" style="s2">all of these different angles yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.970" end="01:39:42.790" style="s2">right yeah as such it couldn&#39;t leverage</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.450" end="01:39:45.310" style="s2">the institutional it just would</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.790" end="01:39:47.440" style="s2">dissipate because everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.310" end="01:39:50.050" style="s2">experiencing different parts of it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.440" end="01:39:54.160" style="s2">yeah it couldn&#39;t get coordinated around</p>

<p begin="01:42:20.390" end="01:42:25.640" style="s2">happens right because it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.930" end="01:42:27.980" style="s2">dynamic system that you can&#39;t predict so</p>

<p begin="01:43:19.020" end="01:43:23.280" style="s2">really academic psychology is just</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.090" end="01:43:25.680" style="s2">basically in purest okay</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.280" end="01:43:28.680" style="s2">yeah the practice domains are either</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.680" end="01:43:31.290" style="s2">dominated by empiricism or you know very</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.680" end="01:43:33.180" style="s2">few academic systems were set up yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.290" end="01:43:35.430" style="s2">really embrace me so it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.180" end="01:43:38.430" style="s2">fortunate to come back to jam you write</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.430" end="01:43:40.260" style="s2">those really there&#39;s a good run as the</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.430" end="01:43:44.310" style="s2">director I stepped down voluntarily for</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.260" end="01:43:45.630" style="s2">the director and started to explore and</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.310" end="01:43:47.400" style="s2">actually it&#39;s a little bumpy because</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.630" end="01:43:48.900" style="s2">outside the role of director and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.400" end="01:43:51.180" style="s2">happened my relationship with the</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.900" end="01:43:55.380" style="s2">program actually went through less than</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.180" end="01:43:59.220" style="s2">ideal people after I stepped off there</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.380" end="01:44:02.040" style="s2">was I got into some clashes with systems</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.220" end="01:44:04.890" style="s2">that were from a political vantage point</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.040" end="01:44:07.380" style="s2">I got polarized a little bit okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.890" end="01:44:11.970" style="s2">details but was sort of had some white</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.380" end="01:44:14.390" style="s2">male dynamics magic experienced</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.970" end="01:44:18.120" style="s2">movements that were so strongly</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.390" end="01:44:19.830" style="s2">progressive you need to be sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.120" end="01:44:22.860" style="s2">intense and pushed back actually Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.830" end="01:44:25.950" style="s2">Peters so Jordan Peterson place and this</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.860" end="01:44:27.990" style="s2">because I had heard bad things about I</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.950" end="01:44:32.850" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really you know through some of</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.990" end="01:44:36.420" style="s2">the left and then I looked you know this</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.850" end="01:44:39.950" style="s2">guy he&#39;s a really serious academic you</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.420" end="01:44:44.130" style="s2">know yeah yeah and while his rhetoric is</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.950" end="01:44:46.410" style="s2">more polarizing than rhetoric I was</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.130" end="01:44:48.690" style="s2">under pressure and firmly to this day</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.410" end="01:44:50.540" style="s2">believe that the mature psychological</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.690" end="01:44:54.510" style="s2">position is to take him very seriously</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.540" end="01:44:56.520" style="s2">and to appreciate what he represents</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.510" end="01:44:59.940" style="s2">culturally as a psychologist fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.520" end="01:45:01.440" style="s2">our obligation right any simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.940" end="01:45:04.890" style="s2">narrative about what he is from either</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.440" end="01:45:08.550" style="s2">side either just an boy narrative that</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.890" end="01:45:11.990" style="s2">he&#39;s you know brilliant perfect or a oh</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.550" end="01:45:11.990" style="s2">my god he&#39;s a complete Transpo</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.950" end="01:45:18.750" style="s2">so I was actually bringing him in to say</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.290" end="01:45:21.870" style="s2">we should study him yeah and we should</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.750" end="01:45:24.690" style="s2">listen well giving him attention for</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.870" end="01:45:25.320" style="s2">some you know and automatically made you</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.690" end="01:45:27.270" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.320" end="01:45:29.820" style="s2">yeah now how I was on the right now I</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.270" end="01:45:31.250" style="s2">was and that&#39;s so by where I was like</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.820" end="01:45:33.560" style="s2">this is a great academic</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.250" end="01:45:34.940" style="s2">Jannetty thrust a dialogue and then to</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.560" end="01:45:37.850" style="s2">be pushed back and then I pushed back</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.940" end="01:45:40.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s when so God you know because</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.850" end="01:45:42.740" style="s2">people got pushed a little bit and that</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.100" end="01:45:45.050" style="s2">which launched me into then into the</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.740" end="01:45:50.780" style="s2">intellectual dark web and rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.050" end="01:45:53.060" style="s2">crap and yeah so 2018 and then I went to</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.780" end="01:45:56.030" style="s2">in a Alexander bard as an intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.060" end="01:45:57.590" style="s2">deep web I went to that and and a</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.030" end="01:46:00.200" style="s2">modernism then I went into the meta</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.590" end="01:46:02.120" style="s2">modernism world right and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.200" end="01:46:05.590" style="s2">hooked up with John Brubaker and was in</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.120" end="01:46:09.140" style="s2">that context I saw a circling world yeah</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.590" end="01:46:12.350" style="s2">jumped out of academia I realized that</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.140" end="01:46:15.320" style="s2">for to me in retrospect the icon what I</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.350" end="01:46:17.480" style="s2">now have my which is that the academic</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.320" end="01:46:21.350" style="s2">psychology is basically a modernist</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.480" end="01:46:23.810" style="s2">empiricist system well the practice of</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.350" end="01:46:26.870" style="s2">psychology is a postmodern sort of</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.810" end="01:46:29.960" style="s2">diversity multicultural system yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.870" end="01:46:32.180" style="s2">and I&#39;m a meta modernist basically and</p>

<p begin="01:46:36.470" end="01:46:40.040" style="s2">and I was bumping my head up against</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.330" end="01:46:41.900" style="s2">sensibilities you know that were</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.040" end="01:46:44.780" style="s2">institutionally organized print</p>

<p begin="01:49:02.239" end="01:49:08.689" style="s2">but but the culture this culture okay so</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.199" end="01:49:10.789" style="s2">the Kairos of the moment in this</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.689" end="01:49:12.499" style="s2">cultures everyone already says wow the</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.789" end="01:49:15.530" style="s2">blue church is not up to speed so this</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.499" end="01:49:19.219" style="s2">schema are hunting for more sense making</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.530" end="01:49:21.469" style="s2">systems yeah yeah and the sensibilities</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.219" end="01:49:23.209" style="s2">of the people that got here they know</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.469" end="01:49:25.369" style="s2">that found themselves in this culture</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.209" end="01:49:27.939" style="s2">more that&#39;s in this particular sort of</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.369" end="01:49:31.489" style="s2">meta modern sensibility way right so</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.939" end="01:49:33.229" style="s2">we&#39;re all sort of looking and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.489" end="01:49:36.079" style="s2">this tree of knowledge thing is weird so</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.229" end="01:49:37.219" style="s2">if you pay attention to tree him up yes</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.079" end="01:49:40.010" style="s2">when I built the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.219" end="01:49:42.019" style="s2">within six weeks I knew this I knew this</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.010" end="01:49:44.959" style="s2">21st century was gonna be really intense</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.019" end="01:49:49.699" style="s2">okay yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.959" end="01:49:51.439" style="s2">why yeah how come okay if you understand</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.699" end="01:49:53.629" style="s2">the structure so you get the emergence</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.439" end="01:49:56.439" style="s2">out of energy comes matter is</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.629" end="01:49:57.999" style="s2">complicated stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.439" end="01:49:59.829" style="s2">and then in the line of life what</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.999" end="01:50:01.840" style="s2">happens is the emergence of a complexity</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.829" end="01:50:04.300" style="s2">building feedback loop that builds</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.840" end="01:50:05.800" style="s2">complex adaptive systems like maples</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.300" end="01:50:08.619" style="s2">okay wait</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.800" end="01:50:10.599" style="s2">cells are these self-organizing complex</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.619" end="01:50:13.689" style="s2">adaptive systems that have formation</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.599" end="01:50:16.510" style="s2">storage not ishutin processing inside</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.689" end="01:50:20.079" style="s2">the cell and that network communication</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.510" end="01:50:22.329" style="s2">between cells yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.079" end="01:50:24.809" style="s2">coordinated functional flow of</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.329" end="01:50:27.579" style="s2">information where it sustains the life</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.809" end="01:50:30.459" style="s2">dimension of complexity right right</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.579" end="01:50:32.650" style="s2">right right all right so then that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.459" end="01:50:35.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a qualitatively different dimension</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.650" end="01:50:38.530" style="s2">yeah why it&#39;s a different cone right and</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.800" end="01:50:40.090" style="s2">the change from life from chemistry to</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.530" end="01:50:45.070" style="s2">biology is fundamentally different than</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.090" end="01:50:48.159" style="s2">just physics yeah is a jump yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.070" end="01:50:49.689" style="s2">a qualitative job right then you then</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.159" end="01:50:51.550" style="s2">you go for three billion years and you</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.689" end="01:50:53.769" style="s2">do in the next jump through the gabion</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.550" end="01:50:56.889" style="s2">explosion and you get to mind and you</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.769" end="01:50:59.409" style="s2">cuz now you get brains pulling cells</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.889" end="01:51:02.739" style="s2">together yeah to create a whole</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.409" end="01:51:04.780" style="s2">coordinated body right right all right</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.739" end="01:51:06.849" style="s2">today an animal that&#39;s like a cell and</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.780" end="01:51:10.630" style="s2">they&#39;re like the nerve is like the DNA</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.849" end="01:51:12.429" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah great and then you got an</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.630" end="01:51:14.199" style="s2">information processing an animal to</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.429" end="01:51:18.070" style="s2">animal communication that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.199" end="01:51:21.820" style="s2">that yeah a mental dimension right okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.070" end="01:51:24.309" style="s2">right so then you get language okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.820" end="01:51:26.650" style="s2">which is symbolic information processing</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.309" end="01:51:30.329" style="s2">in here and communication between people</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.650" end="01:51:32.979" style="s2">mm-hmm right linking up our mind right</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.329" end="01:51:36.429" style="s2">okay right right so here you get a jump</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.979" end="01:51:39.669" style="s2">over to culture yeah so every one of</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.429" end="01:51:41.499" style="s2">these dimensions of complexity is tied</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.669" end="01:51:43.479" style="s2">together by a novel information</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.499" end="01:51:45.280" style="s2">processing system networked together</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.479" end="01:51:51.130" style="s2">through a new communication system</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.280" end="01:51:54.789" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah right right okay now what</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.130" end="01:51:57.340" style="s2">did we do in the 20th century we built</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.789" end="01:52:00.039" style="s2">computers right cute electronic</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.340" end="01:52:03.360" style="s2">information yeah an Internet that we</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.039" end="01:52:06.099" style="s2">started to network it all together yeah</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.360" end="01:52:08.079" style="s2">right and we&#39;re starting to information</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.099" end="01:52:10.690" style="s2">interface with them there&#39;s an Internet</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.079" end="01:52:13.820" style="s2">of Things and we&#39;re building inside</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.690" end="01:52:18.740" style="s2">yeah was artificial Big Data computer</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.820" end="01:52:21.770" style="s2">systems and Ray boom the next dimension</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.740" end="01:52:25.610" style="s2">of complexity yeah on the doorstep</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.770" end="01:52:29.120" style="s2">yeah right right and it&#39;s getting fat</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.610" end="01:52:31.070" style="s2">like each is it&#39;s getting faster and</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.120" end="01:52:33.710" style="s2">faster and faster right the first one</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.070" end="01:52:35.990" style="s2">took 10 billion years to go ahead bang</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.710" end="01:52:39.830" style="s2">to life right there was like three</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.990" end="01:52:42.560" style="s2">billion years to mind yeah this was like</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.830" end="01:52:44.690" style="s2">700 million years to get to culture that</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.560" end="01:52:44.900" style="s2">has been a hundred thousand years all</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.690" end="01:52:47.570" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.900" end="01:52:53.630" style="s2">yeah fifty years and now we&#39;re just on a</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.570" end="01:52:55.730" style="s2">whole 100 year prize right right holy</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.630" end="01:52:57.410" style="s2"> and you&#39;re right on the doorstep so</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.730" end="01:52:59.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like we were so what this is so</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.410" end="01:53:01.160" style="s2">what this showed me is like mountain</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.030" end="01:53:02.870" style="s2">jellyfish that were existed right before</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.160" end="01:53:04.940" style="s2">the Cambrian explosion they had all</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.870" end="01:53:07.340" style="s2">these distributed neural nets moving</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.940" end="01:53:09.860" style="s2">brains and organized body systems</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.340" end="01:53:11.690" style="s2">screams explosion happens and boom you</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.860" end="01:53:15.590" style="s2">get cut brains and complex bodies and</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.690" end="01:53:17.750" style="s2">then the thing mind yeah yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.590" end="01:53:20.180" style="s2">we have a distributed neural networks a</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.750" end="01:53:21.650" style="s2">system equipped with computers and then</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.180" end="01:53:23.750" style="s2">the internet were laying down the</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.650" end="01:53:29.030" style="s2">nervous system right I&#39;m a brain yet</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.750" end="01:53:30.800" style="s2">yeah right so it&#39;s like the 21st century</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.030" end="01:53:32.690" style="s2">is gonna see the beginning of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.800" end="01:53:36.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s no launches into the meta</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.690" end="01:53:39.290" style="s2">cultural dimension yeah a world okay</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.280" end="01:53:41.930" style="s2">yeah what do you like do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.290" end="01:53:43.520" style="s2">sense of like when you imagine what that</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.930" end="01:53:46.550" style="s2">starts to look like and the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.520" end="01:53:48.740" style="s2">things that start to happen like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.550" end="01:53:50.870" style="s2">I can&#39;t imagine you have not like all</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.740" end="01:53:52.910" style="s2">right like that&#39;s the Wow that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.870" end="01:53:55.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the event horizon that</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.910" end="01:53:56.660" style="s2">you know you learn to speak the tree of</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.010" end="01:53:58.790" style="s2">knowledge language you know in set I</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.660" end="01:54:00.650" style="s2">often talk about writing the wait yeah</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.790" end="01:54:03.650" style="s2">so writing the way means you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.650" end="01:54:05.210" style="s2">cusp of the present yeah recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.650" end="01:54:09.200" style="s2">that you&#39;re this unfolding wave of</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.210" end="01:54:13.460" style="s2">probability right okay right at the wave</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.200" end="01:54:15.260" style="s2">of possibility yeah okay we&#39;re so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.460" end="01:54:18.200" style="s2">what and now you&#39;re sitting at this cusp</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.260" end="01:54:20.030" style="s2">of interface layer and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.200" end="01:54:22.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I knew would be coming down</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.030" end="01:54:23.220" style="s2">the road now I didn&#39;t know when and blip</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.340" end="01:54:25.050" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.220" end="01:54:27.300" style="s2">when I actually then started to jump out</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.050" end="01:54:30.540" style="s2">of culture out of my academic culture</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.300" end="01:54:32.610" style="s2">into the new culture ready and heard</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.540" end="01:54:34.170" style="s2">Jordan Hall and Daniel Stockton Berger</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.610" end="01:54:35.430" style="s2">and all these people talking about game</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.170" end="01:54:38.880" style="s2">B yeah</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.430" end="01:54:40.980" style="s2">and the dangers then I realized that the</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.880" end="01:54:43.980" style="s2">old system was getting outpaced by the</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.980" end="01:54:46.170" style="s2">digital so quickly yeah yeah yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.980" end="01:54:47.430" style="s2">actually the teetering of the top and by</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.170" end="01:54:49.980" style="s2">the way every one time you go through</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.430" end="01:54:52.230" style="s2">these it&#39;s dangerous all right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.980" end="01:54:53.970" style="s2">the right amount of complexity has to</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.230" end="01:54:55.770" style="s2">happen right all together at the right</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.970" end="01:54:57.630" style="s2">amount for us you get chaos on the one</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.770" end="01:54:59.790" style="s2">hand or hyper order on the other that</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.630" end="01:55:01.530" style="s2">locks it down yeah have a complex</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.790" end="01:55:03.900" style="s2">adaptive dialectic between order and</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.530" end="01:55:06.560" style="s2">chaos possession the very that&#39;s a fifth</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.900" end="01:55:09.210" style="s2">point is threading a needle yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.560" end="01:55:10.920" style="s2">well I love that was coming later but</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.210" end="01:55:13.350" style="s2">man once I jumped out and looked around</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.920" end="01:55:15.000" style="s2">at the structure of the world I was like</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.350" end="01:55:19.650" style="s2">oh god we might be right on the cusp of</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.000" end="01:55:22.170" style="s2">it yeah right right and then I read into</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.650" end="01:55:24.240" style="s2">there&#39;s this unbelievable paper at least</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.170" end="01:55:26.370" style="s2">for me at the level of magical you talk</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.240" end="01:55:29.550" style="s2">about the spiritual leading edge there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.370" end="01:55:32.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know that singularity from</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.550" end="01:55:35.790" style="s2">oh yeah yeah the venom in which he</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.130" end="01:55:38.760" style="s2">posted in 1945 right well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.790" end="01:55:40.320" style="s2">Russian theorist okay who argued that</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.760" end="01:55:41.700" style="s2">curse walls math was wrong there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.320" end="01:55:45.330" style="s2">whole nother layer of exponential</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.700" end="01:55:47.430" style="s2">acceleration and what he does he finds</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.330" end="01:55:49.680" style="s2">an entirely different data set on the</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.430" end="01:55:52.290" style="s2">curve of complexity from Russian theory</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.680" end="01:55:55.560" style="s2">that empathy that has different events</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.290" end="01:55:56.490" style="s2">okay that are happening yes two totally</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.560" end="01:56:00.300" style="s2">different events</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.490" end="01:56:03.120" style="s2">okay of complexity Russia inventions and</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.300" end="01:56:06.920" style="s2">developments and discoveries and Western</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.120" end="01:56:09.750" style="s2">yeah well these lines on this on his new</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.920" end="01:56:12.090" style="s2">ex cross okay</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.750" end="01:56:14.100" style="s2">the singularity which is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.090" end="01:56:17.280" style="s2">limit function of the exponential if you</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.100" end="01:56:19.320" style="s2">follow the rate yeah yeah theyíve got</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.280" end="01:56:22.560" style="s2">regression lines on the one hand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.320" end="01:56:26.550" style="s2">like point 994 okay and on the other</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.560" end="01:56:28.920" style="s2">regressions 0.996 write one line crosses</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.550" end="01:56:30.440" style="s2">the singularity in 2029 and the other in</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.920" end="01:56:35.380" style="s2">2027</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.440" end="01:56:37.660" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s that okay right</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.380" end="01:56:40.480" style="s2">so there is this kind of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.660" end="01:56:43.450" style="s2">regression line that closes it from</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.480" end="01:56:45.910" style="s2">Russian data point says United States</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.450" end="01:56:51.130" style="s2">date points and crosses out around 2028</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.910" end="01:56:53.410" style="s2">all right yes that would basically point</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.130" end="01:56:56.860" style="s2">to the center joint point</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.410" end="01:57:01.180" style="s2">oh my god Wow eight years away right</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.860" end="01:57:06.700" style="s2">great talk about cosmic coordinates man</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.180" end="01:57:09.910" style="s2">yeah like whoa okay such a trip that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.700" end="01:57:11.380" style="s2">such a favorite when I saw that and then</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.910" end="01:57:13.930" style="s2">I learned about the singularity and then</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.380" end="01:57:16.510" style="s2">I learned about that singularity and</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.930" end="01:57:19.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the digital social techno point</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.510" end="01:57:22.390" style="s2">okay that&#39;s an adaptive observation</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.800" end="01:57:24.580" style="s2">distributed right limit Li that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:57:24.580" end="01:57:31.180" style="s2">century yeah yeah and do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.120" end="01:57:32.920" style="s2">sense of what that&#39;s gonna look like do</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.180" end="01:57:36.060" style="s2">you have any does your imagination go</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.920" end="01:57:38.650" style="s2">into the into that that world at all my</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.060" end="01:57:40.690" style="s2">yes although I was the first thing I</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.650" end="01:57:43.510" style="s2">will learn a new word a little while ago</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.690" end="01:57:54.040" style="s2">by Stewart Kaufman ego I&#39;ve read a book</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.510" end="01:57:56.080" style="s2">by him called the unprecedented so I</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.040" end="01:57:58.300" style="s2">love the principle of the thing has</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.080" end="01:58:01.270" style="s2">whatever its if it&#39;s going to grow it</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.300" end="01:58:04.210" style="s2">has to go between the or the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.270" end="01:58:05.560" style="s2">of order of chaos yeah yeah you guys I</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.210" end="01:58:07.540" style="s2">have a principle of complex that</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.560" end="01:58:11.050" style="s2">updation it&#39;s gonna be found there right</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.540" end="01:58:12.250" style="s2">and when you identify that K you can</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.050" end="01:58:14.410" style="s2">then say well what are they there are a</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.250" end="01:58:16.960" style="s2">lot of chaotic parameters that would be</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.410" end="01:58:19.600" style="s2">nightmares obviously a nuclear work law</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.960" end="01:58:21.610" style="s2">or we can have an Internet</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.600" end="01:58:23.620" style="s2">electronic event like a pulse from a Sun</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.610" end="01:58:27.550" style="s2">and we&#39;ll actually fried all entropy</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.620" end="01:58:28.840" style="s2">will pull the whole thing pretty easy we</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.550" end="01:58:30.700" style="s2">can kill ourselves in the heartbeat</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.840" end="01:58:33.730" style="s2">there&#39;s no law that says has to happen</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.700" end="01:58:35.470" style="s2">okay it it&#39;s on the knife edge of order</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.730" end="01:58:37.330" style="s2">and complexity to build an egg and</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.470" end="01:58:41.320" style="s2">trophic increase</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.330" end="01:58:43.570" style="s2">yeah very so yeah so there&#39;s the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.320" end="01:58:44.920" style="s2">side to thinking crashing firm right</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.570" end="01:58:46.570" style="s2">there&#39;s praise too much instability</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.920" end="01:58:48.580" style="s2">there&#39;s too much change the order</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.570" end="01:58:49.030" style="s2">structures that are organizing the flow</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.580" end="01:58:51.190" style="s2">of reefs</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.030" end="01:58:53.170" style="s2">versus an energy breakdown and we</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.190" end="01:58:56.050" style="s2">control and I see that as a possibility</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.170" end="01:58:57.340" style="s2">in fact over the last my my family was</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.050" end="01:59:01.680" style="s2">getting sick and tired like actually</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.340" end="01:59:01.680" style="s2">global civilization collapse yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.140" end="01:59:08.620" style="s2">now of course we&#39;re like actually yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.760" end="01:59:08.980" style="s2">maybe crazy okay cuz it&#39;s so crazy after</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.620" end="01:59:14.950" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.980" end="01:59:18.360" style="s2">okay right so anyway you know you have</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.950" end="01:59:20.710" style="s2">the chaos and then you have okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.360" end="01:59:24.090" style="s2">is when you have the opportunity for a</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.710" end="01:59:28.300" style="s2">snake the opportunity like for 1984 yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.090" end="01:59:30.670" style="s2">when 1984 was you know when I first read</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.300" end="01:59:34.090" style="s2">that I was like how do you do that you</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.670" end="01:59:35.890" style="s2">know how do you go back and control all</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.090" end="01:59:38.440" style="s2">the information you know what things</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.890" end="01:59:40.090" style="s2">written in print yeah you know that</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.440" end="01:59:41.440" style="s2">would be a mechanical trouble to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.090" end="01:59:44.320" style="s2">already really have to have physical</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.440" end="01:59:45.970" style="s2">control if you have the internet yeah if</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.320" end="01:59:46.780" style="s2">you if you&#39;re the center of control the</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.970" end="01:59:48.400" style="s2">internet then you can have a</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.780" end="01:59:51.760" style="s2">governmental control of everything</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.400" end="01:59:53.290" style="s2">you create any virtual video you want</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.760" end="01:59:55.810" style="s2">we&#39;re not far away from having an</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.290" end="01:59:57.970" style="s2">undetectable virtual video so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.810" end="02:00:00.580" style="s2">a dissident boom just creative yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.970" end="02:00:04.810" style="s2">right locked in you know be like our own</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.580" end="02:00:07.360" style="s2">little matrix nightmare movie great so</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.810" end="02:00:09.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s the terror is this is the idea</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.360" end="02:00:11.260" style="s2">that somebody some brain is gonna then</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.130" end="02:00:13.990" style="s2">use us as manipulative little neurons</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.260" end="02:00:16.930" style="s2">okay and then our complete pawns</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.990" end="02:00:19.750" style="s2">Liat lack all free will right either</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.930" end="02:00:36.400" style="s2">blow it up or get absolutely controls</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.750" end="02:00:41.830" style="s2">yeah great great so you have quarter of</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.400" end="02:00:45.340" style="s2">a mile is somebody there&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.830" end="02:00:48.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a organization called</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.340" end="02:00:50.680" style="s2">Miri here in in in in the Bay Area asks</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.640" end="02:00:52.780" style="s2">where I live and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.680" end="02:00:55.630" style="s2">basically they&#39;ve been worrying they</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.780" end="02:00:57.670" style="s2">just basically have like some of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.630" end="02:01:00.930" style="s2">smartest people like some of the most</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.670" end="02:01:00.930" style="s2">socially awkward</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.010" end="02:01:07.980" style="s2">like totally like but but in the inn and</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.369" end="02:01:11.670" style="s2">he took actually took my circling course</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.980" end="02:01:14.400" style="s2">and they all they do is they think about</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.670" end="02:01:17.849" style="s2">they worry about AI right and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.400" end="02:01:20.820" style="s2">all in and it&#39;s interesting because the</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.849" end="02:01:23.760" style="s2">level of the level of intelligence right</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.820" end="02:01:27.420" style="s2">in the level of thinking that to even be</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.760" end="02:01:29.429" style="s2">able to perceive that they&#39;re like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.420" end="02:01:33.210" style="s2">just it&#39;s just crazy</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.429" end="02:01:36.750" style="s2">and he is like you know um the owner of</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.210" end="02:01:40.139" style="s2">this he you ask him how he&#39;s doing and</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.750" end="02:01:42.389" style="s2">it&#39;s based on where all this is at right</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.139" end="02:01:45.239" style="s2">cuz he really does feel they&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.389" end="02:01:47.670" style="s2">side of you know this thing turns and</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.239" end="02:01:50.070" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s we just don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.670" end="02:01:52.019" style="s2">say-so and so he&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.070" end="02:01:54.480" style="s2">anticipating well how do you do it maybe</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.019" end="02:01:56.460" style="s2">you invent it first and you put any test</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.480" end="02:01:59.599" style="s2">it but I think that one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.460" end="02:02:03.780" style="s2">about this is just fascinating to me is</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.599" end="02:02:06.659" style="s2">one one it like when my imagination goes</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.780" end="02:02:10.619" style="s2">into that event horizon right like and</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.659" end="02:02:12.809" style="s2">is is it there&#39;s this way about about</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.619" end="02:02:15.630" style="s2">the more technological things get the</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.809" end="02:02:17.420" style="s2">faster they disappear right and and</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.630" end="02:02:19.829" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize that that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.420" end="02:02:21.329" style="s2">that when you get up and you look at</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.829" end="02:02:24.210" style="s2">your phone that&#39;s the first thing you</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.329" end="02:02:27.480" style="s2">like literally we think conceptually</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.210" end="02:02:31.710" style="s2">inside of our calendar right like yes it</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.480" end="02:02:34.079" style="s2">becomes and then we start to think with</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.710" end="02:02:37.380" style="s2">it and we don&#39;t notice it by definition</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.079" end="02:02:39.480" style="s2">it disappears right yes where&#39;s before</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.380" end="02:02:41.489" style="s2">it be like most of the time you know you</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.480" end="02:02:44.489" style="s2">would like first of all you&#39;re in a role</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.489" end="02:02:46.469" style="s2">that was given to you from most of the</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.489" end="02:02:48.929" style="s2">things around you like you either made</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.469" end="02:02:50.639" style="s2">or you knew how to fix and it had</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.929" end="02:02:54.900" style="s2">everything had there&#39;s more of this kind</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.639" end="02:02:57.300" style="s2">of you know like it had more resistance</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.900" end="02:02:59.130" style="s2">yeah oh there&#39;s like less and less</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.300" end="02:03:02.159" style="s2">resistance between things but it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.130" end="02:03:04.320" style="s2">this connection with disappearing so it</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.159" end="02:03:06.030" style="s2">makes you make sense to me that like we</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.320" end="02:03:09.300" style="s2">would if something like the horizon</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.030" end="02:03:12.090" style="s2">event horizon line were crossed I doubt</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.300" end="02:03:14.610" style="s2">we&#39;d even notice it like right right I</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.090" end="02:03:15.999" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not like I mean you know as</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.610" end="02:03:18.099" style="s2">somebody says</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.999" end="02:03:20.079" style="s2">guy turns purple and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.099" end="02:03:21.339" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something and they don&#39;t many</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.079" end="02:03:22.479" style="s2">people don&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.339" end="02:03:25.359" style="s2">Ben they believe we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.479" end="02:03:26.829" style="s2">singularity evangelize yeah knowledge</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.359" end="02:03:28.989" style="s2">gives you an idea and basically what it</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.829" end="02:03:31.119" style="s2">is there is it what people have matched</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.989" end="02:03:33.519" style="s2">mapped is the evolution of complexity to</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.119" end="02:03:36.249" style="s2">go away out of line and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.519" end="02:03:40.029" style="s2">transformed right and then there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.249" end="02:03:41.619" style="s2">another operative trans yeah so there</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.029" end="02:03:43.359" style="s2">will be and then basically that line</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.619" end="02:03:47.769" style="s2">it&#39;s its limit and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.359" end="02:03:51.519" style="s2">line on the other side yeah so that is</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.769" end="02:03:54.069" style="s2">and how long friends I mean yeah they</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.519" end="02:03:56.279" style="s2">are it&#39;s the artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.069" end="02:03:59.169" style="s2">that is the computational infrastructure</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.279" end="02:04:01.719" style="s2">hope this met a dimension that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.169" end="02:04:03.249" style="s2">okay and then it&#39;s the inner or</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.719" end="02:04:07.629" style="s2">interface with it</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.249" end="02:04:10.859" style="s2">and then a coal our whole issues we have</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.629" end="02:04:14.559" style="s2">to have a wise interface with it right</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.859" end="02:04:17.649" style="s2">yeah why interface which is not</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.559" end="02:04:19.449" style="s2">something I&#39;m seeing no that&#39;s the error</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.649" end="02:04:21.069" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the term trying to get</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.449" end="02:04:24.309" style="s2">out there is and the reason is of course</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.069" end="02:04:26.439" style="s2">what we did was with stem stem is</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.309" end="02:04:28.629" style="s2">science math and technology it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.439" end="02:04:31.509" style="s2">those hyper hasta autistic spectrum</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.629" end="02:04:33.369" style="s2">folks believably good at the analytic</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.509" end="02:04:35.679" style="s2">justification that&#39;s all that there is</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.369" end="02:04:38.709" style="s2">and built technology that enables that</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.679" end="02:04:42.629" style="s2">to be realized right the courtroom and</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.709" end="02:04:46.029" style="s2">courtyard and human relating piece yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.629" end="02:04:48.669" style="s2">yeah totally and that&#39;s enough that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.029" end="02:04:51.069" style="s2">where all of the morality happens that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.669" end="02:04:53.199" style="s2">all right it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like it does</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.069" end="02:04:57.999" style="s2">seem like it does seem like like yoomin</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.199" end="02:05:00.549" style="s2">I thou it&#39;s the one thing that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.999" end="02:05:02.709" style="s2">optimize right like it actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.549" end="02:05:04.809" style="s2">it&#39;s this place where you can&#39;t collapse</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.709" end="02:05:07.179" style="s2">distances I don&#39;t know it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.809" end="02:05:11.109" style="s2">it&#39;s in confronting your other nests</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.179" end="02:05:15.039" style="s2">then that I you have to grow through</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.109" end="02:05:18.759" style="s2">something to to to feel the mystery of</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.039" end="02:05:21.999" style="s2">you right amen that&#39;s a fullness yeah so</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.759" end="02:05:25.269" style="s2">the if we can create a digital culture</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.999" end="02:05:29.560" style="s2">that honors the levels beneath it yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.269" end="02:05:33.070" style="s2">hey that&#39;s what will create a stable</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.560" end="02:05:36.190" style="s2">honoring sustainable values right okay</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.070" end="02:05:38.440" style="s2">and the danger is is that if this thing</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.190" end="02:05:41.200" style="s2">is constructed without being anchored it</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.440" end="02:05:44.350" style="s2">will tear off become a god on its own or</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.200" end="02:05:46.420" style="s2">multiplicity of gods and we will have</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.350" end="02:05:50.140" style="s2">created by children who don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.420" end="02:05:54.970" style="s2">yeah system of the gods I okay and then</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.140" end="02:05:56.950" style="s2">you know then you order chaos hell you</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.970" end="02:05:59.980" style="s2">know that thing will then rain upon us</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.950" end="02:06:03.040" style="s2">yeah right and so this is like one of</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.980" end="02:06:06.220" style="s2">the ways that for me I thought about</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.040" end="02:06:07.450" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right like right with</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.220" end="02:06:09.880" style="s2">this like this conversation</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.450" end="02:06:13.120" style="s2">mmm-hmm there&#39;s one in a few places and</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.880" end="02:06:15.430" style="s2">I then I can see that where technology</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.120" end="02:06:17.590" style="s2">has brought forth something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.430" end="02:06:20.710" style="s2">fundamentally not technological and made</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.590" end="02:06:23.050" style="s2">it more available right like like so so</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.710" end="02:06:23.920" style="s2">for example all of the all the people</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.050" end="02:06:26.650" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.920" end="02:06:28.510" style="s2">intellectual dark web right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.650" end="02:06:29.920" style="s2">interesting because I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.510" end="02:06:32.740" style="s2">these people would have found each other</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.920" end="02:06:35.560" style="s2">otherwise no this is the potential this</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.740" end="02:06:38.110" style="s2">is the owner this system gives us so</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.560" end="02:06:41.260" style="s2">many look at it I mean you know call you</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.110" end="02:06:45.010" style="s2">up they collapse space-time you have a</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.260" end="02:06:47.560" style="s2">real experience of you&#39;re right and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.010" end="02:06:49.660" style="s2">just hit see yeah you know and then I</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.560" end="02:06:52.390" style="s2">think and we&#39;ll have had this wonderful</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.660" end="02:06:55.420" style="s2">connection yeah hey put it up and have</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.390" end="02:06:58.690" style="s2">it as examples or whatever unbelievable</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.420" end="02:07:00.820" style="s2">okay right so that&#39;s what we need to</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.690" end="02:07:03.340" style="s2">figure out how to cultivate yeah fitness</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.820" end="02:07:05.590" style="s2">so for me what we&#39;re looking at I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.340" end="02:07:08.290" style="s2">defined Thomas Brookman talks about meta</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.590" end="02:07:10.840" style="s2">crises okay the leader in the emerge</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.290" end="02:07:12.190" style="s2">thing I characterize them as follows so</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.840" end="02:07:15.460" style="s2">there&#39;s the digital globalization</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.190" end="02:07:16.900" style="s2">meta-crisis son okay and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.460" end="02:07:18.580" style="s2">changing everything so the blue church</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.900" end="02:07:20.230" style="s2">is totally archaic and then what are we</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.580" end="02:07:23.230" style="s2">going to evolve into and it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.230" end="02:07:25.030" style="s2">to topple us are we gonna grow we have</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.230" end="02:07:25.990" style="s2">the tech no environmental crisis which</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.030" end="02:07:28.960" style="s2">is the way they were chewing up the</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.990" end="02:07:30.670" style="s2">earth again you know seven you know plus</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.960" end="02:07:32.440" style="s2">billion of us that are pulling the</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.670" end="02:07:35.640" style="s2">technology out and how the hell are we</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.440" end="02:07:38.950" style="s2">gonna manage that without serious damage</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.640" end="02:07:40.480" style="s2">and third so those are major structural</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.950" end="02:07:43.030" style="s2">issues but then we have the human</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.480" end="02:07:47.080" style="s2">problems of meaning mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.030" end="02:07:50.290" style="s2">yeah so so what we need I love that you</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.080" end="02:07:52.300" style="s2">have Rafael behind you right yeah so</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.290" end="02:07:54.070" style="s2">what we need and this went from this is</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.300" end="02:07:57.400" style="s2">where I really come into the equation in</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.070" end="02:08:01.810" style="s2">China we need an Enlightenment 2.0 quick</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.400" end="02:08:05.650" style="s2">yeah that reboots the Academy yeah roots</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.810" end="02:08:09.910" style="s2">our socio-political court-yard right</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.650" end="02:08:14.320" style="s2">waiting right okay yeah so that as this</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.910" end="02:08:16.950" style="s2">thing grows we all are not know what we</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.320" end="02:08:21.340" style="s2">need as human being that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.950" end="02:08:22.390" style="s2">totally and we can start the sea you</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.340" end="02:08:24.240" style="s2">know it&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.390" end="02:08:27.070" style="s2">interesting for me and starting to get</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.240" end="02:08:29.260" style="s2">because because we started circling and</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.070" end="02:08:31.930" style="s2">I got into Heidegger and I&#39;ve been kind</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.260" end="02:08:33.760" style="s2">of the one that&#39;s been the like working</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.930" end="02:08:36.190" style="s2">out that what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.760" end="02:08:41.080" style="s2">mapping it out and distinctions and</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.190" end="02:08:43.090" style="s2">stuff um but pretty much like I for the</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.080" end="02:08:45.130" style="s2">most part I really hadn&#39;t had much many</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.090" end="02:08:47.770" style="s2">people to talk to at this level right</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.130" end="02:08:49.150" style="s2">and so when I started this podcast it</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.770" end="02:08:51.400" style="s2">was just like well I thought it because</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.150" end="02:08:53.170" style="s2">like interesting to have a podcast and</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.400" end="02:08:55.390" style="s2">have people on interested people on and</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.170" end="02:08:57.670" style="s2">then do something like an interview or</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.390" end="02:08:59.650" style="s2">like a circle but then I started like</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.670" end="02:09:01.210" style="s2">actually talking to people that have</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.650" end="02:09:03.310" style="s2">actually read some of the same books</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.210" end="02:09:06.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve read and write all this rigor</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.310" end="02:09:08.860" style="s2">around it and it is blossomed to this</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.550" end="02:09:14.380" style="s2">whole other thing that I&#39;m still inside</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.860" end="02:09:17.440" style="s2">of going on this ride it&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.380" end="02:09:23.020" style="s2">ecstatic but but at one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.440" end="02:09:25.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed is that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.020" end="02:09:28.300" style="s2">like for example this is in a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.420" end="02:09:31.420" style="s2">with you like see like seeing you right</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.300" end="02:09:34.240" style="s2">in a very real way he&#39;s really seeing</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.420" end="02:09:36.340" style="s2">your ideas and it&#39;s seeing the being</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.240" end="02:09:41.170" style="s2">right that&#39;s called forth and those</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.340" end="02:09:42.790" style="s2">ideas right like it&#39;s it&#39;s uh is that</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.170" end="02:09:45.940" style="s2">there&#39;s people it seems like the people</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.790" end="02:09:48.990" style="s2">that are are can start to address these</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.940" end="02:09:48.990" style="s2">problems right</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.090" end="02:09:54.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole world of people like</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.280" end="02:09:56.240" style="s2">that that that are just that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.080" end="02:09:57.740" style="s2">right this is and this is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.240" end="02:10:00.200" style="s2">figuring out that network and</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.740" end="02:10:02.120" style="s2">distributing it and then and making sure</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.200" end="02:10:04.010" style="s2">that we stays connected with as many</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.120" end="02:10:07.280" style="s2">people as possible don&#39;t become isolated</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.010" end="02:10:09.770" style="s2">yeah totally the attentional systems in</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.280" end="02:10:12.700" style="s2">a swing sort of way into our communities</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.770" end="02:10:14.690" style="s2">yeah the systems is you know that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.700" end="02:10:17.000" style="s2">because and I do believe that people</p>

<p begin="02:13:12.960" end="02:13:18.690" style="s2">concept of God you know this idea of a</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.690" end="02:13:20.910" style="s2">loving agape that as we the mutual</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.690" end="02:13:24.390" style="s2">relational value that&#39;s experience then</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.910" end="02:13:27.090" style="s2">it just moves into the social field yeah</p>

<p begin="02:13:27.090" end="02:13:32.640" style="s2">iterative process of that jumps it up on</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.330" end="02:13:34.670" style="s2">the one hand or what happens you know</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.640" end="02:13:37.140" style="s2">when you see a polarized hell scenario</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.670" end="02:13:40.550" style="s2">it just tears it all down and you just</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.140" end="02:13:42.840" style="s2">feel the design of the tension and</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.550" end="02:13:44.760" style="s2">everybody it&#39;s more than the negative</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.840" end="02:13:48.060" style="s2">exchange its negative through everybody</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.760" end="02:13:50.130" style="s2">yeah yeah or the reverse when it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.060" end="02:13:53.580" style="s2">cumulative and then through everybody so</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.130" end="02:13:55.710" style="s2">it&#39;s just this elevation great totally</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.580" end="02:13:57.960" style="s2">yeah because isn&#39;t it kind of is also</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.710" end="02:14:00.180" style="s2">Vista level of like and this is where I</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.960" end="02:14:02.490" style="s2">think and what we&#39;ve been talking about</p>

<p begin="02:14:05.130" end="02:14:10.890" style="s2">where actually you move into like a</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.050" end="02:14:12.960" style="s2">metacognitive right right we&#39;re we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.890" end="02:14:15.140" style="s2">some level you start to like this that</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.960" end="02:14:18.200" style="s2">you start to</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.140" end="02:14:21.440" style="s2">how do you put this it&#39;s like you start</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.200" end="02:14:23.030" style="s2">to feel into and direct almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.440" end="02:14:25.670" style="s2">almost like touching into the logos</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.030" end="02:14:27.200" style="s2">directly right on some level where you</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.670" end="02:14:31.880" style="s2">have these moments where everything</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.200" end="02:14:33.680" style="s2">starts to look you realize the thing</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.880" end="02:14:37.730" style="s2">that&#39;s been having the conversation the</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.680" end="02:14:53.750" style="s2">whole time but that would be where</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.730" end="02:14:56.540" style="s2">everything&#39;s fractal and that that in an</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.750" end="02:14:59.660" style="s2">walking feel spiritual right totally in</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.540" end="02:15:01.880" style="s2">like the neurology and all the things</p>

<p begin="02:15:04.310" end="02:15:10.730" style="s2">also and here&#39;s the important part is</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.910" end="02:15:12.950" style="s2">like it matters whether or not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.730" end="02:15:14.750" style="s2">looking at reality right and that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:15:21.050" end="02:15:28.160" style="s2">the feedback loop right that&#39;s the thing</p>

<p begin="02:15:40.460" end="02:15:44.150" style="s2">experiential system but man if that</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.470" end="02:15:49.970" style="s2">correspond to reality</p>
