<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">a a more participatory experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">and i found in myself um this this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">question that i&#39;ve been asking myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">and uh and now those around me how i</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">how i might seek wisdom and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:49.759" style="s2">a more participatory way with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">indigenous cultures on the land that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.759" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">at and and where i find um i went on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">hike the other day and i found this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">trail called like red ochre falls or</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">something and i found these</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">pots of um of red oak like in the spring</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">coming from the ground and there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">signs sort of illustrating how they</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">might have been used</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">by indigenous cultures and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">people standing around and taking photos</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">and i had this sense like what would it</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">be like to play in there and have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">experience but it felt to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">off limits and so my curiosity was like</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">what is the way in which i can</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">with wisdom and respectfully and learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">about this in a more participatory way</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what my my question</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">circles around i&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">some of your thoughts around that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky isn&#39;t it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of um</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">like i i i know in the states there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">lot of similar</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">uh problems to hear that when um</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">so as indigenous people when we try to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">and um and do our thing you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">land in places especially national parks</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">and things like that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">hostility</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">and so we found that we we have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">of sneak in there when there&#39;s no one</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">read recently</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">about violence um and a key insight of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">his work if you&#39;ve read it or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">familiar</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">is that there&#39;s an existential threat to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">violence as we&#39;re experiencing it in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">west</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">if he&#39;s right then our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">repression of local violence will result</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">in a build-up and a release of violence</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">at a much larger level</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">um and like you know the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">and the atrocities that happened then is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">sort of the perfect example of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">what it could look like um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">the next time that happens it&#39;ll be even</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:19.120" style="s2">according to his theory um but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">solution he proposes which</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">seems to be pretty popular in the sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">of game b crowd that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">you know a lot of us sort of walk in um</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">is to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">sacred all-violence in order to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">break free of that memetic cycle that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">puts the entire species at risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">in your book you take the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">perspective it seems um sort of calling</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">swift and memorable violence at a local</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">but also immediate forgiveness which</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">also sounds</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">like highly attractive and i was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">wondering more if you could sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">expand upon the sort of punishment</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">system that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">the first peoples use um and how that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">works and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">where you see that interacting with sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">of gerard&#39;s theory that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">basically abolish violence well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">really a punishment system punishment is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">is sort of a small part of it um</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s your policing is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s just conferred</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:14.639" style="s2">into the hands of a few powerful people</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.639" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">like violence like everything like</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">it&#39;s distributed uh throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">system and it keeps moving</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">in that kind of dynamic subordination</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">you know so depending on the context</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">and the knowledge that&#39;s needed uh but</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">particularly the place and which family</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">or which</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">person speaks for that place of where</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">you might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s where that authority is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">now with the violence it is it is highly</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">and highly rule governed and it looks</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">like chaos but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">rule-governed</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">um so basically it minimizes the damage</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">uh the physical damage that&#39;s done and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">then there&#39;s a lot of follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">protocols as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">so for example uh down here where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">staying now</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">there was a protocol in the old days of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">you know anybody that you injured in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">battle or in a fight</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">which was highly controlled that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">would be responsible for their care</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">afterwards so you know it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">like maim someone up really badly if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">know that you&#39;re going to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">for their care</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">you&#39;re only going to want to hurt them</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">badly enough for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">you know okay well i can look after this</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">this guy for two weeks i&#39;m gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">him two weeks worth of damage</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">because that&#39;s all i&#39;m prepared to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">you know there&#39;s other things i</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">mentioned in the book like um you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">with uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">knife fighting um the winner of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">night fight knife fight</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">has to be cut up exactly the same as the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">loser</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">you know so the person with the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">cuts is the loser but then the winner</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">like they stand them side by side and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">they look where the cuts are</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">and they cut them so that both of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">have exactly the same cuts</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">and yeah i&#39;ve participated in that one</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">thing to do to cut somebody else if</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">you&#39;re um</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to get the same cut and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s the point of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">you realize that you&#39;re just hurting</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">yourself you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">different places have different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:34.560" style="s2">so then there&#39;s also the um there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">other mob to the norther here who they</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">a martial arts system based on the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">kangaroos fight</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">um you know because they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">really badly injured but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">incredibly violent but there&#39;s rules you</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">know protocols and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this this big explosion</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">of violence and everybody walks away</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">from it unscathed but</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">they get it out of their system you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">yeah and i suppose you have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">look there&#39;s i don&#39;t know if you come</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">ever come across the work of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">a a an anthropologist called napoleon</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">shanian</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">um he studied he did this um</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">seminal study of the yanamani indians in</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">the amazon</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">who he called the most violent people on</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">earth and so he videotaped</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">you know hundreds of hours of footage of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">just big</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">brawls in the community people fighting</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">and i&#39;ve watched quite a bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny they seem to be wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">mostly and like screaming and writhing</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">there&#39;s not much physical damage being</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">um but then if you look into his work</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">you see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um is anyone here come</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">across the continuum concept</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">uh that book so that&#39;s that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">exactly the same people but studied by a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">woman who was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">childbirth and child wearing practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">she reports a very different experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">of those people</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">you know very peaceful very happy</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">people because of her approach to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">but this fella he he came in and he he</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">gave them gifts immediately</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">and like machetes and axes and things</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">and those people hadn&#39;t seen steel</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">before and so they you know they started</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">fighting over those gifts and he filmed</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">them fighting</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s funny you see them with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">machetes but they don&#39;t use the machetes</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">in the fire</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">you know they&#39;re mostly wrestling and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">he decided so he got them to um</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">in exchange he got them to report to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">all of their genealogies</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">so who was related to whom and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">they reported that to him he fed it into</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">the computer</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">to do an analysis of their kinship</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">system to see who was related to whom</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">and then spent thousands of hours uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">watching the videotapes</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">and he noted a pattern whereby you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">people who were related to each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">would look after each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">fights</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">and people who were closely related</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t fight each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">and they&#39;d support each other against</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">other opponents</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">and uh his argument was that these</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">people were so primitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">that they couldn&#39;t possibly hold all</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.160" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">that genealogical</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">information in their heads only a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">computer could do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">so therefore they were being driven by</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">something unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">even though they told him their</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">genealogies that&#39;s how he found out</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">about it he said they couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">it was so weird um</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">but people took his work seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">so out of that came the idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">that selfish gene idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">the idea that people are machines who</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">have no</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">real conscious choice about their</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">behavior but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">your genetics are driving you um</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">you know as an as as an individual agent</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">you know you&#39;re going to be selfish</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">because your genes are selfish and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">they want to do is replicate</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">so your behaviors will be driven by that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">and that all of those behaviors can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">figured out with algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">on a computer and i mean you know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">that gave rise to next hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">you know all these the neoliberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">social fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">um that idea of the human being as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">consumer that can be manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">um and that you know i mean the entire</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">uh system that&#39;s developed over the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">30 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">uh has been around that idea so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:38.720" style="s2">the idea of liberalism uh the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">freedom and liberty that&#39;s been imposed</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.720" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">on the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">you know is this idea of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">going around fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">whatever their wants and desires are and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">that somehow in the aggregate that forms</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">the invisible hand of the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:55.200" style="s2">and that that will just the market will</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">solve everybody you don&#39;t need community</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.200" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">you don&#39;t need family you don&#39;t need</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">marketplace that&#39;ll sort it out but then</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">also that within that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">people can be manipulated you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">uh you know into behaving in certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:17.039" style="s2">um you know through their algorithms and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">you know what that&#39;s turned into with uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.039" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">social media and and all of the rest all</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">mobile phone devices all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">thing it goes right back to that old</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">asshole anthropologist buddy projecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">weird ideas onto indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">and like i said if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">continuum concept a female</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">anthropologist would see a completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">when she goes in and she&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">child-rearing practices</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">she sees a very different culture there</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">with very different conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">um yeah sorry that was a really long</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s kind it&#39;s kind of important</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">because it it establishes this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">the primitive is something that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">must project its own narratives back</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">onto</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">you know in order to support this idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">of progress</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">this idea of growth this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">so you know the myth of progress can</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">only exist with a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">um you know paleolithic past</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">of of brutality and simplicity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">and the fittest survive you know so they</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">get all the desirable traits like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">um you know like</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know stuff like you know rape</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">is normal and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">and you know secretly every woman wants</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">to get raped i mean you must have seen</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">those studies</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">you know um you know and they just</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">project it like</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">they say they&#39;re being scientific but</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">they&#39;re projecting a narrative backwards</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">that they have no proof for that just</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">yeah that goes back to caveman times</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">when everybody was raped</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know and they picture they</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">walk around in nature and it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">that&#39;s all these plants and animals just</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">raping each other that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">thing but as human beings we&#39;re rising</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">above that we&#39;ve developed we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">and you know so we have to control</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">ourselves and we have to control</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s just going to be endless</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">rape and murder um</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s just we all know that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">um but for some reason we&#39;re all going</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">along with the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:28.840" style="s2">and that narrative is bullshit and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:31.360" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.840" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">anyway that guy&#39;s dead now that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.360" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">anthropologist</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">explanation of how a whole community</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">works to hold wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">and knowledge and you know as</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">a whitey in a village mainly of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">um colonizers who all have</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">very very different narratives about</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">place and belonging</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">how to sort of work</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">as a community to develop collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">meaning so i&#39;ve been running pilgrimages</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">to um visiting all the mountains in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.919" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">river and so forth so taking the kids</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">and every year climbing higher</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">and sort of growing into these places</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">and really</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">making commitment through coming into</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">relationship with country</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">um but the difference the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">sorry i&#39;ll try and get the point the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">difficulty between</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">my own deep personal experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">in country</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">that&#39;s very powerful compared to trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">to hold</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">a hold space for community connection</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">to to places when we don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">ritual or meaning about um</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">country and the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">the depth of relationship with the more</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">than human world that is possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">so i know what you mean interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">your thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">how to develop collective connection in</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">such a fractured</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">kind of world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">well it comes out of the first one i</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s easy enough to control your own</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">you know or to influence yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">you know despite what the studies of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">yanomani indians tell us</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">you can actually decide to walk along</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">the river</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s not your selfish genes making</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">you do it you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">um but when you&#39;re doing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">interacting with a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">complex self-organizing sentient system</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s filled with sentient uh human and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">non-human entities</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">you know other than humans and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s something of a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">surrender but it&#39;s an acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">you know when you start to you obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">have reached that where you come into</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">that place and you become part of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">field that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">observing itself um</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.720" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;re no longer standing</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">outside of the field observing it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">going oh this is an ecosystem and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">is connected to this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">connected to this and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">i understand the secret system now</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">you&#39;re actually in it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">and you&#39;re not trying to observe it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">you&#39;re just part of a system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">observing itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re accepting those flows of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">information hey tyson flows</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the those flows of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">information coming through and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">not trying to accumulate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">and walk away with a hypothesis or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">story to share or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">you&#39;re just letting it</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">come through you and then letting it go</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">and letting it change you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.720" style="s2">letting it transform you and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">adapting to that place</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.720" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">and all kinds of entities of spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">um you know little parasites microscopic</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">things they&#39;re all coming into you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">they&#39;re in that place</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re changing you and making you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">part of that place</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">and warburton is as good a place as any</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.039" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">one of the few sort of living places</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">left in around this horrendous city</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">uh where we are here i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">horrible this this city</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">you know built on a destroyed swamp is</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">it&#39;s really terrible um yeah but see</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">that&#39;s that sort of individual work but</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">i mean it starts out like that but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">you&#39;re really coming into a collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">and so i&#39;d say that&#39;s the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">second part of your question</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">you know how to connect with others is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">that you can&#39;t force it you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">if you think you&#39;ve come away from your</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">individual work</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">on the land with an idea of how things</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">or you think you have an answer or you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">think you have a solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">or you think you have a set of tasks</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to do that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">or you&#39;ve learned something and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">think oh everybody should know this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">everybody should know this everybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">should think like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">if everybody thought like this the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">would be a better place i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">make change</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be the change i want to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">in the world you&#39;re an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">you know because everything you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">learned</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">destroyed it right there</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">you know and you have to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">the wider community</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">and everyone in the world in the same</p>

<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">and following that and allowing that to</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">who&#39;s decided to organize it all and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">these are the dates and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do and</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">of them like rise and fall this year</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">five of them i&#39;ve been involved with</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">reluctantly as soon as you give it a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">and um it&#39;s finished</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">yeah i wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">how indigenous thinking can save the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">world is your byline was that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">publisher then</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not my byline yeah i thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">you know the chapter uh forever ltd</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">for forever limited yeah that was my</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">title</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">was forever ltd and that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">um you know which is not good i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">takes too much too long to explain that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">no one understands what that means</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna buy a book called forever</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">ltd but that was the point</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">it was like i don&#39;t want to name it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">and that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">title itself was sort of it was trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">to get across the idea that as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">you name something it&#39;s finished</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s corporatized it&#39;s branded and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">stuffed so i was i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">ironically do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">um and so i only had the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">connecting with a few hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">through the book who might read it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">and you know just um because i can</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">manage a few hundred relationships um</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">but anyway it kind of went the other way</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">and it went how indigenous thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">could save the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">you know at a time whenever there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">crisis of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">and and people are obsessed with sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">making and they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">anywhere and considering weird stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">um so it&#39;s ended up um you know suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">you know a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">relationships that i just can&#39;t manage</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">at all um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">so i&#39;m doing the podcast because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">that&#39;s new campfire and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">i can at least you know superficially</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">touch base with</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">who&#39;s read the book and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a promise of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">there and of an ongoing dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">i assumed i&#39;d be able to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">and i just yeah i can&#39;t do it</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">and one of the parts of it that really</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">stood out for me that i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">intrigued by</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">was how you began your sense making</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">process your your</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">your cognitive process of picking out a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">topic by crafting a tool</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">and then um going through this whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">process and like each</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">part of the tool will like represent</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">some part of your thinking so</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">if you&#39;d be so gracious um could you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">maybe demonstrate or</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">kind of like show that process that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">would be amazing</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">yeah i saw that uh question pop up so i</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">was thinking about how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">uh so i grabbed a couple of things um</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know so you you find it in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">um the basic visual images and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">communications of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a circle and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s kind of a a square or a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:18.960" style="s2">diamond or a triangle kind of thing um</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">like you always see these things um</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.960" end="00:33:24.799" style="s2">in a lot of the in a lot of the shapes</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">for the symbology you know um</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.799" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of how carving goes as</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">but so i mean you can see and this male</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">or female energy stuff in there</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">and you probably can&#39;t really see it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">there it&#39;s not a very good image</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">but you so you can see that male kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.760" style="s2">orion</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">constellation you know that all around</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.760" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">the world is called the hunter you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">or the warrior you know um</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s that kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">know square or diamond shape happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.960" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">there with</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">through that constellation and then here</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">on the other side you&#39;ve got them um</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">you can see the more circular stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a seven sisters story the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">pleiades constellation</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">um so you kind of see this coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">through and i don&#39;t know i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">this in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">practice of carving this is that orion</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to see but yeah so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">doing a boomerang</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">uh so it&#39;s basically two things with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">lot of the weapons</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">um so doing the boomerang both these so</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">this this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">law stick here and so that&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">round</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">one you know a rounded object</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">there um and so these both start out as</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">logs you know they&#39;re just a log</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">and so for that for this one</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">you know you basically start out</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">you know chopping it there until you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">that rounded or pointed</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">and but you see how i&#39;m turning it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">you&#39;re just always turning it like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got it here and hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">them like baby&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">i&#39;m never allowed to do this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s hard because if i try and do</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">it at work there&#39;s all this oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">shit going um workplace health and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">safety things that are missing</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">messing up my my practice um</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">and someone inevitably calls security or</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">um and it&#39;s hard in the city because</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">people call the cops when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">sitting somewhere with an axe like</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">but anyway i&#39;ve done them all and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">managed not to um</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">to die or be incarcerated for too long</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">or anything yet so that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">um anyway yeah so you&#39;re holding it like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">a little baby&#39;s head here</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">and you actually can&#39;t cut your fingers</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">off doing that and so you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">turning it and you&#39;re chopping chipping</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">and you&#39;re turning turning and you do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">all the way down like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s that circular motion uh as</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this sort of haptic cognition</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">this embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:09.040" style="s2">going in i don&#39;t know is it probably a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">lot of you probably know about the new</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">materialism</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">that would be a way into thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">this kind of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">where you have neural processes</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">happening beyond your skull</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">and actually into the tools and objects</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">that you use but then into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">relationships with people places</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">and entities all around you you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re working in these stories and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">these places</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">as you cut you&#39;re cutting it into there</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">and so you&#39;re ending up this is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">a um a usb like a memory stick you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">you&#39;re encoding all the information into</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">and then you might etch some designs in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">there that are like</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">little mnemonic triggers for some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">that information</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">now i&#39;ve done here so that&#39;s a map of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">place there</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">that i&#39;ve put in there but this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">problematic because it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s black wattle</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">uh from a place where wattle is male</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">uh but i brought it down here and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">carved it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">on country where wattle is female</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">and so there&#39;s knowledge from elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">and then there&#39;s knowledge from here in</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">there so i&#39;ve got this really</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">problematic law stick</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">um that auntie had to flog me for</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">but not with yet um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">she&#39;s got her own sticks um so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">that one there&#39;s that circle way</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">with the carving but then this one here</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">this is cool i haven&#39;t shared this with</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">anyone yet these these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">um this one and i can&#39;t share too much</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s male activity and and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">can make</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">a woman sick like seeing me do this</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">um not just a woman like um</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">any uh menstruating organism</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">um can get sick from watching me uh if i</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">was actually carving</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">i could could do this i could get sick</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">um anyway so i like uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">this one it&#39;s it&#39;s a log and you&#39;ll cut</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:25.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">like that first on that angle so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.839" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">making a point all the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">along there and then you do it on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">so what you end up with in the cross</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">section is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">a diamond shape</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">carved out of the log and then you cut</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">those part both sides of the diamond and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s still thick then</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">so you do it again you basically keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">making a diamond shape</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">and then you cut the ridges off that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">sort of landscape of the wood</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">uh you bring it flatter until it comes</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">flat like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">you know so this one is um it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">very different way of cutting</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">so you you&#39;re encoding a really</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">different kind of knowledge and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">different sort of way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">you know into that wood um you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">all the different carvings have</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">so a lot of the things i might make out</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">of bark like a shield or a coulomb or</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">and then a wooden shield that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">different way of cutting as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s different kinds of thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">are going into there</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">but then different stories of place from</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">where the wood comes from</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">um yeah and where you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">walking and working and where those and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">what stories come in there</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">so like each one is a chapter in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">so this one is um is really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">um the probably problematic idea of uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">holistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">which is one of those words that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">overused and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">under under um known</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">you know little understood you know um</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">so this was that chapter lemonade for</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">headaches</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">uh where i look at medicine a bit you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">know and i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">look at um you know how it can be useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">um like a useful intersection between</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">indigenous knowledge and western science</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">is to um try and help uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">like mainstream researchers</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">include the variables of time and place</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">in their work so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">studies where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">the results have have not been</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">replicable because</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">the researchers ignored time and place</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.520" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">medicine research with with plants they</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">ignore where the plants is harvested</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">and they ignore the season in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">those plants are harvested</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">so they have variable results and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">they have inconclusive data</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:41:01.599" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why you know um</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">there is no evidence that fish oil is</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.599" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">to your health because they&#39;ve not been</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">have have replicable results in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">studies because they don&#39;t pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">to where they&#39;re catching the fish</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">or what time of year those fish are</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:19.359" style="s2">harvested</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">so you might have one study that shows</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.359" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">like this miraculous bloody</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">effect on the kidneys and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">one will show no effect at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">yeah so um you know i try to help people</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">out with including those variables of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">time and place</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">in their research and and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">valuable thing that can come from</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">knowledge it&#39;s part of the whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">that the truth being in the aggregate of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">all the stories</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">uh coming amongst each other you know um</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">you know every model and scientists know</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">this every model is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">but useful in some context</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">every model every theory is useful in</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">in in the right context but</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">it is wrong there isn&#39;t a unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">and some people are looking for that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">like a holy grail because that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">the project of westernism</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">is to find one unified narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">one unified body of knowledge one</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">unified belief system one unified</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">language to rule them all</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">um is the project of westernism and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s a pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">universe it&#39;s a pluralistic reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s just the physics</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">of the reality that we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s magical thinking to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.079" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a unified field theory or</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">um and it&#39;s a damaging process to um</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the entire society and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">economic system and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">geopolitics and and everything is built</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">around that fantasy of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">of of that one unified good</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">way and that somehow the anglo sphere is</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">going to be the repository</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">of all knowledge and uh you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">just unified into one monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">um which is kind of that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">apocalypse looks like</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">so the english word for universe you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s based on vertebrae</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">which means to become so verse is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">verso like turned into</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">and then uni is one so even the english</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">word for the universe is this fantasy of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">turning everything into one monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">one unified system and a unified system</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">like what everything looked like before</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">so nothing there is no</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">one one doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:43:58.960" style="s2">you know one is just zero there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.960" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">one because it&#39;s not possible to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">anything existing in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">without being in relation to something</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">and then out to many other something</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">you know it&#39;s we only exist in relation</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">to other things</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">and in different contexts the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.440" style="s2">meaning of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">of that relation and that reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.440" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;m offline on a bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">benjamin has a question about crash</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">related to your your tool making i had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.359" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">question about</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">uh how you learned and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">um you know how old were you what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">process and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">looking forward do you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">craft that you learned</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">is being passed on in a sustainable way</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">um yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">but um a lot of people think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">it&#39;s dead and gone a lot of our own</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">people think that too that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.280" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s happening in the same spaces</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">people are sneaking in at night first</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s happening like that um i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">finding that the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">is being held like quietly and privately</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">by people of knowledge uh all over the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">they just don&#39;t talk to anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">and they don&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">the media and um you know while they</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">have things that they want to share with</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">um like old man juma in my book you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">he has things that he wants to share</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">with the world to sort of make a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">action in spirit occur you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">uh to you know he he wants to enact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">and so he&#39;s given me those things to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">pass on to the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">you know these are just um</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not though they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">they&#39;re not those things</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not those deeper knowledges and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">and understandings</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">you know um yeah these are the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">way of bringing people into that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">gradually bringing people back into</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">um you know which kind of needs to occur</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">hey i saw a question pop up about gender</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">yes that was hannah this is a i mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:40.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a really highly problematic thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a big contested issue um in our</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.839" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">as well and it&#39;s a very hard thing to to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">um if you&#39;re worried about um</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">maintaining a brand or anything um</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:56.319" style="s2">or maintaining i don&#39;t know the ability</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.319" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">because there&#39;s pretty much not anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">that anyone can say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">a bunch of people aren&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">upset about at the moment there</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">at the same as everywhere else uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">fortunately i&#39;m not really concerned</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">with my brand so</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">i can talk up as much as i like about</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">um unfortunately i don&#39;t have a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">opinion about it because every</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">you know um it&#39;s kind of like um</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">you know in the old days if you were an</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">ambassador it was really different</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">um to what diplomats do today there was</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">quite a bit of sex involved because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">had to establish those relations first</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">you know and a lot of it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">constrained by the same kind of labels</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">um as it is today</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">i and i think a lot of settlers and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">particularly missionaries and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">and stuff like that were really um like</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">horrified by what they saw</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">and and a lot of that so most of it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">not recorded</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">actually you know almost there&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">few hints here and there of what was</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">uh in terms of sexuality and sex and uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">gender and gender roles and all that</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">kind of thing and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">misapprehensions</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">so everybody&#39;s taken on board the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">mythology of uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:46.640" style="s2">you know men were the hunters and women</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.319" style="s2">where the gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.640" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a universally</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.319" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">unchallenged assumption</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">uh that a lot of science and psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:50:00.559" style="s2">um ah governance everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">you know is based on that idea and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.559" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">kind of bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">um and i think if you really look into</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll see you know like i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">that neanderthal men and women had the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">same fracture patterns</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">uh in their skeleton skeletal remains</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">um which is really a really important</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">they just noted that you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">studies but they didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">draw any conclusions from that because i</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">i think it would unravel</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">pretty much all of you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">civilization and society as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">to acknowledge that women were bloody</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">hunting</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">women in europe were hunting megafauna</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">bros they were doing it the same way as</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">the men were</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">you know um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">i like you know they can acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">that neanderthals are a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">advanced</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">than we thought you know because like</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:58.559" style="s2">especially after they found out that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">most europeans have neanderthal dna</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.559" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">um then they discovered that ah actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">they had a really advanced</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">chaotic culture oh yeah in the end it</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">wasn&#39;t cro-magnon</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">cro-magnon had a 10 bigger brain than</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">modern humans that&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">um so they&#39;re able to acknowledge all</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">that uh but</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t revise the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">gender role thing</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">like civilization is built on you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">the subjugation</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:31.280" style="s2">you know just by accident of birth</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">of half the population that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">civilizations work</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">there there isn&#39;t there isn&#39;t a</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.559" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">if civilization is patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s necessarily patriarchal because you</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">this lifetime</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">these feminine and masculine concepts</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">map</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">onto the items that you showed us</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:30.240" style="s2">and i think you mentioned a die as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s viewed differently in two</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">different cultures so</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">i was wondering if you could speak to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">that but if you feel it has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">covered enough then that&#39;s okay too um</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">yeah um and and i mean i&#39;m just um</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">you know i&#39;m creating these things</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">within the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">the traditions that i belong to um</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">you know and within the the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">you know the knowledge has been passed</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">to me along that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">and um i i guess it&#39;s it&#39;s dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">female and male energies and of course</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:08.079" style="s2">everybody&#39;s got um</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">a bit of both in different uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.079" end="00:56:12.799" style="s2">sort of percentages in their being and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s fluid because that can change</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.799" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">throughout your life</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">you know and it does change throughout</p>

<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">because if you if you make it through to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">extreme old age</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">uh to to elderhood you know um</p>

<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">when you get older so throughout your</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">life there is a shift</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">in that that masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">energy so that&#39;s why elders are able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">uh different things and they have their</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">own kind of secret business that they do</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">um they don&#39;t particularly share with</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">uh because they&#39;re working with a very</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">different um</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">sort of admixture of men&#39;s business and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">women&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">um as they go along to those really high</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">levels of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">um you know but the rest of us will be</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">sitting from moment to moment in</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">you know with male energy in our belly</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">or female energy in our belly</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s only certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">that those things can come alongside</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">each other productively or safely</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">uh so there&#39;s lots of community ritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">activity and um</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">you know man or woman together you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:36.160" style="s2">things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:36.160" style="s2">and all of the the um</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">ritual and knowledge and practice around</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.359" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">children and child rearing</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">these are all points of intersection</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:47.760" style="s2">where those</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">energies can come together but um</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.760" end="00:57:51.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of things that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">have to be separate because</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.520" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">a man&#39;s energy is uh what&#39;s just often</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">described too in aboriginal cultures as</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">sour</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s a bitter and sour energy</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">and that that kind of like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">people hearing that from the first time</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:08.640" style="s2">hmm yeah that&#39;s true you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.640" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">smell it&#39;s a different chemistry you</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:16.160" style="s2">know to the spirit of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">and then um whereas women&#39;s women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.160" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">energy is</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">is it&#39;s a it&#39;s different it&#39;s um</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.839" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of energy</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">um and the problem with uh bringing</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">those together</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">um in in the wrong way and in the wrong</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">male&#39;s energy as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.160" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">you know um so it&#39;s um it&#39;s important in</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:59.280" style="s2">a lot it&#39;s important to maintain um</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:59:00.400" style="s2">male and female spaces you know where</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.280" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">activities can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.400" end="00:59:04.559" style="s2">done that aren&#39;t going to make people</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">sick um</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.559" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">yeah but at the same time</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s pretty much a foundational</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">concept of indigenous cultures</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:28.559" style="s2">as that um everything good happens in in</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">between</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.760" end="01:06:41.760" style="s2">and build from the pattern that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:45.280" style="s2">find there to reclaim</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.760" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">you know a way of being human uh that is</p>

<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">just horrific things that wreck the</p>

<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:20.160" style="s2">some way of being human um that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.760" end="01:07:21.760" style="s2">real and that actually occupies our</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.160" end="01:07:24.559" style="s2">ecological niche</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.760" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">and our our role as a custodial species</p>

<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.000" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">like it when people try and lump</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:33.359" style="s2">those genuine seekers in with white</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">activists</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.359" end="01:07:37.119" style="s2">um you know who are really just trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">to make a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">arc where they can keep all of their</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">stolen goods</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">and and carry it across into the next</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">yeah that uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:51.599" style="s2">the white atavism that you described</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">there sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.599" end="01:07:55.280" style="s2">a match made in hell between russo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.240" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">state of nature</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:07:59.119" style="s2">and and the maga like make america great</p>

<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:06.079" style="s2">and and trying to keep trying to keep</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.319" end="01:08:08.799" style="s2">the moral purity of one</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.079" end="01:08:09.520" style="s2">and the the stolen wealth of the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.799" end="01:08:12.640" style="s2">yeah</p>

<p begin="01:08:25.759" end="01:08:29.120" style="s2">the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.880" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">and economic success of the jewish</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.120" end="01:08:34.319" style="s2">diaspora everywhere</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.400" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">mean that you can see the continuity</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:53.199" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:54.159" style="s2">of jewish culture everywhere you go in</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.199" end="01:09:57.199" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.159" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">um you know and you can see the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.199" end="01:10:00.960" style="s2">kinds of continuities everywhere else</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">a lot of us as indigenous people i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.960" end="01:10:06.239" style="s2">could learn a lot from the jews</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">in terms of um you know stabilizing and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.239" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">being able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">self-support and separate our culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:13.440" style="s2">from the mainstream but just</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">you know keep it there but then also be</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.440" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:18.320" style="s2">you know distribute our gifts to the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:20.960" style="s2">culture as well</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:22.239" style="s2">so you know i mean where would we be</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.960" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">without seinfeld</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.239" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">um so you&#39;ve got this culture producing</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:28.080" style="s2">all these amazing things that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">wants</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.080" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">and um and that&#39;s the relation you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:35.199" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">and i guess you know um and</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.199" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no particular plan for it um</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:42.719" style="s2">i think people like to project plans</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">like the protocols of the elders of zion</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.719" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">and assume that there has to be a plant</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:49.199" style="s2">um but i i don&#39;t see that in jewish</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">culture i see this um</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.199" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just that idea of</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:55.120" style="s2">fostering the conditions for emergence</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.239" style="s2">you know people are behaving and living</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.120" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">in the right way</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.239" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">and good things come out of that and i</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:01.600" style="s2">and i guess that that&#39;s a human way to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.600" end="01:11:06.800" style="s2">um if there&#39;s a if there&#39;s a plan for a</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">kind of universal jewish cabal</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.800" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">to manipulate global economies i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:14.960" style="s2">in on it</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s just it i just think i</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.960" end="01:11:17.600" style="s2">think i think the jewish culture is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">perfect example of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.600" end="01:11:24.159" style="s2">you know of not having a plan you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:26.400" style="s2">but having an an an ethical pattern that</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">has followed and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.400" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">you know the good things emerge from</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:33.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">you know um yeah it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.120" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">a collective sort of supportive</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:42.719" style="s2">you know uh a group of all very</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:45.760" style="s2">different individuals all together</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.719" end="01:11:48.880" style="s2">just um allowing</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">you know creativity to emerge um</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.880" end="01:11:52.880" style="s2">allowing things to emerge and now</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">allowing you know governance patterns</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.880" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">and things like that to happen i mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what i see in the diaspora</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:11:59.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not what i see in israel that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.000" end="01:12:01.120" style="s2">different thing like i said but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.360" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">what i see in the diaspora</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.120" end="01:12:05.360" style="s2">and i think that like the jewish</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:06.560" style="s2">diaspora is a pretty damn good model of</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.360" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.560" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">of how to be in in really and how to</p>

<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:16.239" style="s2">and not just survive it but thrive and</p>

<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">were just on a call</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.199" end="01:13:19.040" style="s2">a couple hours ago we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.040" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">greek dialogue and sort of some ideas</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">that they had about</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:26.480" style="s2">you know how to relate to each other so</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:29.360" style="s2">that you could have a good conversation</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.480" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">you know a conversation that sort of is</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.360" end="01:13:32.640" style="s2">fruitful</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:35.520" style="s2">or leads to us being able to do things</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.640" end="01:13:36.800" style="s2">together that we couldn&#39;t do separately</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.520" end="01:13:39.440" style="s2">you know in your book you talk a lot</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.800" end="01:13:40.640" style="s2">about you know yarny about how you get</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.440" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.640" end="01:13:44.159" style="s2">with people and you want to have this</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.159" end="01:13:48.080" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.000" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">storytelling it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.080" end="01:13:51.600" style="s2">experimental storytelling where you</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.600" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">and so i was just curious you know like</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.960" end="01:13:55.120" style="s2">when you hear about the greeks do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:13:56.800" style="s2">just think oh hey</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.120" end="01:13:58.400" style="s2">they were just getting those greek dudes</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.800" end="01:14:00.719" style="s2">they were just yarny</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.400" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">or different or how would you compare</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.719" end="01:14:04.159" style="s2">the two what do we</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.840" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">not get about it well i think the only</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.159" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">difference is um</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:09.600" style="s2">is abstraction so in the the greek stoa</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.600" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">what was discussed was was abstracted</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:18.880" style="s2">and um and sort of um not</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:20.400" style="s2">not sitting within a context a living</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.880" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.400" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">um so it&#39;s that birth of reductionism</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">you know that idea of okay so for</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:27.600" style="s2">example being able to separate the</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">concepts</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.600" end="01:14:31.520" style="s2">so inventing a word for nature and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:34.560" style="s2">separating that</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.520" end="01:14:36.560" style="s2">from the word for society which so</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.560" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">in indigenous cultures and in most human</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.560" end="01:14:42.080" style="s2">cultures prior to that</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">the invention of the stower um</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:46.480" style="s2">prior to those greek yarns you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:48.080" style="s2">there was no separate concept for nature</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.480" end="01:14:50.320" style="s2">or environment</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.080" end="01:14:51.600" style="s2">you know uh so that was i&#39;d say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.320" end="01:14:53.840" style="s2">the only difference</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.600" end="01:14:55.600" style="s2">but for the rest of it in in the the</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.840" end="01:14:57.120" style="s2">form and shape of it i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.600" end="01:15:00.640" style="s2">lot of similarities</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.120" end="01:15:02.159" style="s2">you know particularly just the flow of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.640" end="01:15:04.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.159" end="01:15:06.480" style="s2">and that kind of respect and the idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.800" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">the idea that the truth could be found</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.480" end="01:15:10.960" style="s2">in the aggregate</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.239" end="01:15:12.800" style="s2">and that there wasn&#39;t this idea of uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.960" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">with a lot of the traditions anyway</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.800" end="01:15:16.239" style="s2">um because there were different</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:17.440" style="s2">different schools of thought of course</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.239" end="01:15:20.719" style="s2">over time and even</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.440" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">at the same time um this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.719" end="01:15:26.400" style="s2">you know you weren&#39;t there to um</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">to dominate through discussion and to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.400" end="01:15:30.239" style="s2">have your story come out on top</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">and for yours to become the dominant</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.239" end="01:15:33.440" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.360" style="s2">you know they weren&#39;t seeking a dominant</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.440" end="01:15:37.920" style="s2">narrative they were seeking</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.360" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">not even a consensus but they were kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.920" end="01:15:42.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:44.480" style="s2">seeking a pluralistic aggregate of truth</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.640" end="01:15:46.000" style="s2">where you know the outliers on the bell</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.480" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:52.080" style="s2">are interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:54.000" style="s2">that story you know adds to the context</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.080" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">of the rest of the bell</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.000" end="01:15:59.040" style="s2">you know what i mean um but rather than</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:16:00.239" style="s2">just focusing exclusively on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.040" end="01:16:02.640" style="s2">majority opinion</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.239" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">or even more dangerously just focusing</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.640" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">on the outlier</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:11.520" style="s2">stories which is always dangerous um</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:12.400" style="s2">yeah that they were able to try and try</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.520" end="01:16:14.640" style="s2">and form this</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">this this holistic view of all the</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.640" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">stories together</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:20.239" style="s2">and to find sort of a shape of the truth</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">within that</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:24.640" style="s2">you know you do that but but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:25.920" style="s2">say that because there&#39;s there&#39;s no word</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.640" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">for truth</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.920" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">you know there aren&#39;t these abstracts so</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:32.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve never had to separate</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.000" end="01:16:33.600" style="s2">out all these ideas and talk about them</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:36.560" style="s2">because they just</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.600" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">are that&#39;s part of the contextual</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.560" end="01:16:39.440" style="s2">foundation of the whole yarn in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:41.600" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.440" end="01:16:43.199" style="s2">so you&#39;re coming to the yarn and ninety</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.600" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">percent of it is just context that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.199" end="01:16:47.199" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even need to be said</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.360" end="01:16:49.840" style="s2">so you can have a quite an economy of</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.199" end="01:16:49.840" style="s2">words you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.800" end="01:16:55.120" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to listen like this</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.719" end="01:16:56.960" style="s2">here there&#39;s where i&#39;m talking for like</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.120" end="01:16:59.280" style="s2">maybe eight or ten minutes at a time</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:17:02.080" style="s2">straight that doesn&#39;t have to happen</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.280" end="01:17:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of back and forth you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.080" end="01:17:04.320" style="s2">and unless like there&#39;s an old person</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.600" end="01:17:07.520" style="s2">telling us</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.320" end="01:17:08.800" style="s2">long story or something then you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.520" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.800" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">but then then old people only tell the</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:15.199" style="s2">old story like the entire story</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">you know in a really specific genre</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.199" end="01:17:17.920" style="s2">that&#39;s you know telling a story to</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.920" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">because most of the time you only get a</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:22.880" style="s2">fragment of the story that&#39;s relevant to</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:25.760" style="s2">a place</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.880" end="01:17:28.560" style="s2">or a context or you know you&#39;ll only</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.760" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">hear part of the story</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.560" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">and it&#39;ll be so you receive that story</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:34.000" style="s2">out of order</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">over a number of years in different</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.000" end="01:17:38.000" style="s2">contexts rather than being told from</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">start to finish</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.000" end="01:17:42.800" style="s2">in that way so i guess everything&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:46.080" style="s2">of different</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.800" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know and that uh you know we</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.080" end="01:17:48.640" style="s2">impose these time structures but also</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">spatial</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:52.400" style="s2">structures i mean now a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.640" end="01:17:54.320" style="s2">think if you&#39;re sitting in a circle</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.400" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it but you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.320" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">just turning a straight line into a</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:17:58.400" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:17:59.920" style="s2">you start with one person then everybody</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.400" end="01:18:02.480" style="s2">gets their turn with the talking stick</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">as it goes around</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.480" end="01:18:06.719" style="s2">and everybody in order just monologues</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.480" end="01:18:12.159" style="s2">while everybody has to listen to them</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.719" end="01:18:14.159" style="s2">um that&#39;s not yawning either</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.159" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s hard to describe even what</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.159" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">johnny means</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.920" end="01:18:23.360" style="s2">christian would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">christian did you hear me</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:40.000" style="s2">let&#39;s go to thomas yeah i&#39;m here sorry</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.080" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">about that christian&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.000" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.360" end="01:18:48.080" style="s2">um what was my question</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:50.080" style="s2">i had to write it a few times so i</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.080" end="01:18:52.080" style="s2">should probably refer back to it rather</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.080" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">than try to do it from memory</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.080" end="01:18:57.920" style="s2">uh okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:18:58.719" style="s2">is mythology something to be held in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.920" end="01:19:01.760" style="s2">purely</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.719" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">allegorical way something to extract</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">meaning from the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:07.600" style="s2">and then integrate it into one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.600" end="01:19:11.360" style="s2">and your sense making and then kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.840" end="01:19:14.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.360" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">put in its place or discarded or</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.640" end="01:19:18.480" style="s2">is there something to be gained from an</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:23.120" style="s2">emotional commitment</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.480" end="01:19:25.679" style="s2">to a mythological story um</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.120" end="01:19:26.320" style="s2">something like divine and sacred that</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.679" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">you can like</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.320" end="01:19:33.600" style="s2">it should it can be alive in you um</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.560" end="01:19:35.040" style="s2">or yeah it&#39;s a question of like how to</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.600" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">balance yeah like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.040" end="01:19:39.679" style="s2">relating to the divine through mythology</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">uh while allowing for like</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.679" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">pluralism at the level of you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:45.199" style="s2">understanding what&#39;s going on so to</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:48.840" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.199" end="01:19:52.000" style="s2">well mythology doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.840" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">um and the divine doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.000" end="01:19:55.120" style="s2">at least as a separate thing from</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.920" end="01:19:56.640" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.120" end="01:19:58.159" style="s2">you know what what people are calling</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.640" end="01:20:01.120" style="s2">mythology now</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.159" end="01:20:01.920" style="s2">or myths all these sorts of things well</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.120" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">all they are</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.920" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">is a it&#39;s just a model</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.280" end="01:20:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a model of reality that&#39;s useful in</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:12.080" style="s2">some contexts</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.040" end="01:20:13.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s when you fucking use it you</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.080" end="01:20:16.159" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.679" end="01:20:17.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s like any other you know as</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.159" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">newton you do use newton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.760" end="01:20:22.880" style="s2">physics like you i mean you do every day</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:25.760" style="s2">in a lot of the technology that you use</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">and it&#39;s a useful model of reality in</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.760" end="01:20:29.440" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.960" style="s2">circumstances but for the zoom meeting</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.440" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">to work</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.960" end="01:20:34.960" style="s2">and for the the relative time to happen</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:37.280" style="s2">is this signals buzzing up to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.960" end="01:20:39.520" style="s2">satellite and then bouncing down into a</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.280" end="01:20:42.880" style="s2">million places around the globe at once</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.520" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">um newton that wouldn&#39;t work we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.880" end="01:20:45.199" style="s2">have this zoom</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:47.920" style="s2">on the newton model we&#39;ve got to go to</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.199" end="01:20:49.679" style="s2">einstein for a bit</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.920" end="01:20:51.760" style="s2">you know which is also only useful in</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.679" end="01:20:52.880" style="s2">some contexts it&#39;s useful to make the</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.760" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">zoom meeting where</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.880" end="01:20:57.280" style="s2">to make the tech work so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:20:58.960" style="s2">the model for that</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.280" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">uh what people are calling myths and</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.960" end="01:21:03.679" style="s2">mythology uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:05.679" style="s2">deeply layered things you know and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.679" end="01:21:07.040" style="s2">mostly people are only coming in at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.679" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">folklore</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.040" end="01:21:12.719" style="s2">children&#39;s fable level of the mythology</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.560" end="01:21:14.639" style="s2">and that has a purpose it&#39;s mostly just</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.719" end="01:21:16.159" style="s2">to put kids to sleep</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.639" end="01:21:17.840" style="s2">god damn it at night because we need a</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.159" end="01:21:21.040" style="s2">minute to ourselves fuck</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.840" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">um but you know the rest of the deep</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.040" end="01:21:25.760" style="s2">layers of mythology</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:29.760" style="s2">um you know they contain</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.760" end="01:21:33.520" style="s2">maps memory knowledge that are useful</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.760" end="01:21:35.600" style="s2">in contexts they&#39;re useful</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.520" end="01:21:37.280" style="s2">in you know there&#39;s parts of myths that</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.600" end="01:21:40.000" style="s2">are just for women</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.280" end="01:21:40.800" style="s2">or just for old women and that they only</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.000" end="01:21:44.239" style="s2">apply</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.800" end="01:21:46.159" style="s2">you know as a model in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.239" end="01:21:47.440" style="s2">you know such as inducting a young woman</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.159" end="01:21:49.199" style="s2">into this area</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.440" end="01:21:50.719" style="s2">of reality or something like that and</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.199" end="01:21:53.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.719" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">um you know but it&#39;s also for medicine</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.600" end="01:21:57.360" style="s2">it&#39;s also for this and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:58.880" style="s2">this whole universes of knowledge in</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.360" end="01:22:01.040" style="s2">there in every</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.880" end="01:22:02.239" style="s2">mythology there&#39;s there&#39;s various models</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.040" end="01:22:03.360" style="s2">that are applicable in different</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.239" end="01:22:05.120" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.360" end="01:22:06.400" style="s2">but useless in other contexts so why</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.120" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">would you even look at it</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.400" end="01:22:13.040" style="s2">um but it&#39;s the same as everything else</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.600" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">you know there are i mean i guess you</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.040" end="01:22:16.320" style="s2">could think of a lot of engagement with</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">myth and ritual as uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.320" end="01:22:21.679" style="s2">in terms of uh simulation you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:23.520" style="s2">uh simulation and modeling that you do</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.679" end="01:22:25.199" style="s2">to try and predict how a system will</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.520" end="01:22:27.520" style="s2">behave and all that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.199" end="01:22:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.520" end="01:22:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just like software</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.120" end="01:22:36.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s um you know software for</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.480" end="01:22:39.120" style="s2">the mind not just your mind but you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:40.960" style="s2">the mind of the sentient uh landscapes</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.120" end="01:22:42.880" style="s2">and context that you inhabit</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.960" end="01:22:44.480" style="s2">um you know your mythology is just a</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.880" end="01:22:46.880" style="s2">handy bit of software for that</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.480" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s no big deal it&#39;s just the same as</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.880" end="01:22:50.800" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:52.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a handy model of theory that you</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.800" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">can apply to certain</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.800" end="01:22:56.400" style="s2">concepts as soon as you elevate it to</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:23:00.080" style="s2">this this this</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.400" end="01:23:01.600" style="s2">goddamn spiritual uh thing of</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.080" end="01:23:04.080" style="s2">of this you you&#39;ve got to have this</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.600" end="01:23:06.880" style="s2">religious or or something</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.080" end="01:23:08.639" style="s2">or that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the place</p>

<p begin="01:25:04.080" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">to look for secret knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.199" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">but in your book uh you mentioned how</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:18.639" style="s2">rhyme and alliteration were great ways</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.400" end="01:25:23.280" style="s2">of disseminating knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.639" end="01:25:24.880" style="s2">and one one thing that stood out to me</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.280" end="01:25:26.960" style="s2">in the back of the book in your last</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.880" end="01:25:28.480" style="s2">chapter and you also talked about it</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.960" end="01:25:31.600" style="s2">with omajuma</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.480" end="01:25:34.480" style="s2">is the seven spirit families so</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.600" end="01:25:34.880" style="s2">this is something i found through a rap</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.480" end="01:25:39.280" style="s2">song</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.880" end="01:25:43.040" style="s2">actually uh it&#39;s from christoph crane</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.280" end="01:25:46.239" style="s2">he created a double album called kairos</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.040" end="01:25:46.719" style="s2">and he goes quite in depth about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.239" end="01:25:48.679" style="s2">seven</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.719" end="01:25:50.159" style="s2">spirit families and the seven</p>

<p begin="01:25:50.159" end="01:25:54.159" style="s2">and i was just wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.320" end="01:25:57.520" style="s2">expand on that more because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.159" end="01:25:57.520" style="s2">kind of been consumed by it</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.239" end="01:26:02.960" style="s2">it is um it&#39;s just a rabbit hole it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.719" end="01:26:06.480" style="s2">fractal rabbit hole that one</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.960" end="01:26:09.199" style="s2">was and you just um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.480" end="01:26:10.239" style="s2">yeah you start to get a sense that that</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.199" end="01:26:12.080" style="s2">we all</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.239" end="01:26:14.639" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ve heard that explained as just</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.080" end="01:26:16.320" style="s2">you know um just a universal pattern</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.639" end="01:26:19.920" style="s2">recognition thing that</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.320" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">that humans or many name way of the same</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.920" end="01:26:24.080" style="s2">sort of shapes and so if there&#39;s a vague</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:26.320" style="s2">man shape of something in the sky then</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.080" end="01:26:29.600" style="s2">everyone will see that as a man</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.320" end="01:26:31.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s i mean</p>

<p begin="01:27:15.360" end="01:27:18.639" style="s2">they&#39;re holding on to the out of africa</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.360" end="01:27:21.040" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.639" end="01:27:22.159" style="s2">that&#39;s why like every time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.040" end="01:27:23.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a discovery</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.159" end="01:27:25.440" style="s2">we get every year there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.360" end="01:27:27.360" style="s2">announcement like oh um</p>

<p begin="01:27:27.360" end="01:27:30.320" style="s2">suggests that uh</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.800" end="01:27:33.280" style="s2">aboriginal people have actually been</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.320" end="01:27:37.040" style="s2">here for more than 100 000 years</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.280" end="01:27:40.639" style="s2">you know but the record still says</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:42.239" style="s2">60 000 or 60 000 plus they can&#39;t move it</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.639" end="01:27:45.280" style="s2">on from that because the math doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.239" end="01:27:48.080" style="s2">work for the out of africa theory</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.280" end="01:27:49.520" style="s2">chances are like from from everything</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.080" end="01:27:51.120" style="s2">that i keep looking at</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.520" end="01:27:53.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen there&#39;s a really there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.120" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">really good argument for um</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.280" end="01:27:57.760" style="s2">for people coming out of uh here</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.520" end="01:27:58.320" style="s2">australia like our old people&#39;s stories</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.760" end="01:28:00.639" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.320" end="01:28:02.000" style="s2">um or you know what was i mean at a time</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.639" end="01:28:03.760" style="s2">when australia wasn&#39;t even just</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.000" end="01:28:05.280" style="s2">australia it was just</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.760" end="01:28:07.199" style="s2">you know part of a big asian sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.280" end="01:28:08.960" style="s2">land mass um</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.199" end="01:28:10.400" style="s2">yeah chances are people actually came</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.960" end="01:28:13.760" style="s2">out from there</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.400" end="01:28:15.679" style="s2">um like modern humans um</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.760" end="01:28:17.679" style="s2">but then even this idea of modern humans</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.679" end="01:28:20.080" style="s2">is a bit of a misnomer because</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.679" end="01:28:22.320" style="s2">you know modern humans is just a hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.080" end="01:28:24.239" style="s2">of seven different bloods</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.320" end="01:28:26.840" style="s2">and i guess you can look at those</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.239" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">studies you know you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.840" end="01:28:31.840" style="s2">homoflorences homo neandophthalus</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.840" end="01:28:34.080" style="s2">uh you know your cro-magnon and your</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.840" end="01:28:37.040" style="s2">homo erectus and all right</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.080" end="01:28:39.760" style="s2">and then the denisovans and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.040" end="01:28:43.199" style="s2">something else it&#39;s like seven bloods</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.760" end="01:28:45.040" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.199" end="01:28:46.239" style="s2">the idea of all those families coming</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.040" end="01:28:49.040" style="s2">together again is</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.239" end="01:28:49.600" style="s2">kind of nice you know um and yeah old</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.040" end="01:28:52.320" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.600" end="01:28:54.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s basically the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.320" end="01:28:55.040" style="s2">of the book is it&#39;s just a delivery</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.080" end="01:28:57.920" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.040" end="01:28:58.880" style="s2">um for you know this this spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.920" end="01:29:02.800" style="s2">vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.880" end="01:29:04.800" style="s2">of his six symbols that have just uh he</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.800" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">wanted it to go out into the world</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.800" end="01:29:09.199" style="s2">and so this is just a delivery system</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s just a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.199" end="01:29:13.280" style="s2">marketing and packaging around that in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.040" end="01:29:14.960" style="s2">book people keep reading the book and</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.280" end="01:29:17.040" style="s2">saying it&#39;s changing change them at the</p>
