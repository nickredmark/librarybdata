<p begin="00:00:06.710" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">hey folks welcome back to the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.690" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">podcast livestream our 18th this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">question and answer portion and we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">now going to address your super chat</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">questions starting with the ones from</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">the first hour and continuing on to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">ones from this hour so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">burning questions feel free to enter</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">them so as as has been the the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">we will spend about a half an hour on</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">these from the first hour at which we</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:40.620" style="s2">have ranked mostly just by monetary</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">amount not entirely did a very poor job</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.620" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">and they will try to answer the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:45.329" style="s2">ones in the order if they come in in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">second hour but we&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">start with one from last time we had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:51.059" style="s2">lot of good questions last time that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to because we were focusing</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">on evergreen only questions there are a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">number of them I&#39;d like to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">now but there was one at a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:00:59.480" style="s2">high dollar level that was quite good so</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:01.770" style="s2">we&#39;re actually was start there already</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.480" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">from Martin when the Beringia pnes</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.770" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">migrated into the americas and the ice</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">age ended they were effectively isolated</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">from the rest of humanity how long would</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">the isolation of the varangians</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">descendants up needed to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">lead to a new and distinct species of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">Homo say however Indiana&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2">great question which I am now going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">dodge so stealthily so my answer would</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">be the funny thing about humans is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">human populations function like species</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:32.850" style="s2">in other clays and so in a sense it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:35.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take any time at all of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.850" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">you&#39;re really looking at is whether they</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">behave differently enough that we would</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">justify such a claim on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">if you&#39;re asking how long would it take</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">for the genetic isolation to create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">barrier to mating so great that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">would be incapable of crossing it a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">long time would be the answer and we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">tell that because apparently</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">Neanderthals and modern humans did mate</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">that we&#39;re all missing in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">question the answer is staring us in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">face how long does it take for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">language to become uninterpretable by a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:15.569" style="s2">descendant language</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:17.099" style="s2">right and so in some sense to people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.569" end="00:02:19.079" style="s2">cannot communicate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.099" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">because they do not share a language can</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.079" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">produce an offspring but they are very</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">unlikely to buy any honorable route and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:28.139" style="s2">so that is a kind of speciation</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">mechanism but it is below the species</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.139" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">level is if the population level yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">that&#39;s great and I&#39;ve just finished that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">by pointing out how many such divisions</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:42.599" style="s2">there are among the descendants of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">varangians that a Navajo and a Qunari</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.599" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">person in the Andes and valdivian from</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:52.199" style="s2">the coast of the west coast of South</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:55.169" style="s2">America or one of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.199" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">southern tip of Claire Terra Tierra del</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.169" end="00:03:00.299" style="s2">Fuego would have almost nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:02.969" style="s2">common they were dealing with different</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.299" end="00:03:04.829" style="s2">problems in different places and they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.969" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">been separated by enough time and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.829" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">distance that they would have shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:13.500" style="s2">little language if any and this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:16.859" style="s2">this is that so there was change over</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.500" end="00:03:18.479" style="s2">time and these species boundaries that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.859" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">we put on things you know the usual</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.479" end="00:03:23.609" style="s2">definition of species that people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:26.430" style="s2">in their heads is one of can they mate</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.609" end="00:03:28.019" style="s2">right if if two individuals can get</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.430" end="00:03:30.389" style="s2">together and produce viable offspring</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.019" end="00:03:31.919" style="s2">this is the so-called biological species</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.389" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">concept which of course raises all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.919" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">of questions about one of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:36.689" style="s2">species concepts you might have and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">unfortunately we can spend a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.689" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">of time talking about all the different</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:42.620" style="s2">species concepts once you get into it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:47.879" style="s2">evolutionary biology you see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.620" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">species is a necessary distinction to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.879" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">use to talk about differences between</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:57.719" style="s2">populations but at best the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">between species are always fuzzy at at</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.719" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">temporal borders and sometimes at</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:05.159" style="s2">spatial ones - yeah at first they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">but in human beings if you&#39;re incapable</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.159" end="00:04:09.959" style="s2">of conveying the concept hey how about</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">dinner and a cave painting maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.959" end="00:04:15.269" style="s2">not gonna get anywhere and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:17.250" style="s2">effectively a mating boundary you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.269" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">that look in your eye I do all right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.250" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">going to pretend you don&#39;t thanks</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">Christian this word from echo over</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:26.410" style="s2">evolutionary time does the why</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:28.270" style="s2">some lose most of its original genes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.410" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">increase its non recombining region</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:33.970" style="s2">what is the benefit our male mutations</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:36.370" style="s2">more risky as in a winner-take-all or</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.970" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">get wiped from the gene pool before I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.370" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">know you wanted to answer this let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:47.080" style="s2">just clarify that the Y chromosome is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:48.580" style="s2">present in male mammals but that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:50.830" style="s2">that particular mode of sex</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.580" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">determination is a mammal specific thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.830" end="00:04:59.650" style="s2">so this answer may or may not what cat</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:05:02.110" style="s2">cat antics may or may not obtain across</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.650" end="00:05:05.080" style="s2">a wider swath of evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.110" end="00:05:07.960" style="s2">yep all right so what I wanted to say in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.080" end="00:05:10.450" style="s2">response to this one is if you think</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.960" end="00:05:13.479" style="s2">about chromosomes and the information</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.450" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">they carry most of your chromosomes all</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.479" end="00:05:18.100" style="s2">the autosomes spend an equal amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">time in male form and female form they</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.100" end="00:05:21.100" style="s2">find out in the zygote what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:23.380" style="s2">gonna be and then they are that thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">they&#39;re trapped for that period of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:28.510" style="s2">in male or female form and they act</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">accordingly the Y chromosome is quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.510" end="00:05:33.310" style="s2">different the Y chromosome is the only</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:36.940" style="s2">one in which the genes know whether they</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.310" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">came from mom or dad and that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.940" end="00:05:42.100" style="s2">hazard with the Y chromosome which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:45.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s genes can play a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.100" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">game its genes can play against the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.160" end="00:05:51.880" style="s2">maternal chromosomes and in their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:56.139" style="s2">interest so for example a gene that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.880" end="00:05:59.470" style="s2">found itself on the y chromosome and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.139" end="00:06:03.010" style="s2">a zygote would know that it came from</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.470" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">dad and therefore might take more</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.010" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">resources from mom during pregnancy</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:11.500" style="s2">especially in a species or population in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:13.090" style="s2">which mating was not monogamous because</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.500" end="00:06:15.780" style="s2">they would know that the siblings that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.090" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">they would be depriving of resource by</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.780" end="00:06:22.150" style="s2">extracting more than the mother was</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:24.010" style="s2">tempted to give would not be close</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.150" end="00:06:28.690" style="s2">relatives they&#39;d be 1/4 siblings rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.010" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">than 1/2 siblings so in effect the best</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.690" end="00:06:34.630" style="s2">argument that I&#39;m aware of is that the Y</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">chromosome is devoid of most coding</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.630" end="00:06:39.490" style="s2">genes because it is untrust</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:42.690" style="s2">and therefore it has effectively been</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.490" end="00:06:44.980" style="s2">shut down so here&#39;s the punchline I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.690" end="00:06:46.360" style="s2">thought that the white chromosome being</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.980" end="00:06:50.070" style="s2">untrustworthy was a pretty good punch</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.360" end="00:06:53.710" style="s2">line already it gets better okay if</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.070" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2">patriarchy were a real thing it would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.710" end="00:06:59.320" style="s2">on the y chromosome and therefore it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:00.910" style="s2">been shut down because the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.320" end="00:07:02.920" style="s2">genome understands it has an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.910" end="00:07:05.080" style="s2">preventing that kind of competition from</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.920" end="00:07:07.320" style="s2">breaking out now I want to be very</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.080" end="00:07:10.420" style="s2">careful here I do not believe that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.320" end="00:07:13.060" style="s2">patriarchal phenomena are unknown or</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.420" end="00:07:15.970" style="s2">impossible it is patriarchy which I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.060" end="00:07:17.830" style="s2">regard as a myth and so noting that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.970" end="00:07:21.010" style="s2">biology long before anybody was</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.830" end="00:07:23.230" style="s2">discussing anything had taken up arms</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.010" end="00:07:25.600" style="s2">against the possibility of patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.230" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">and had left the rest of the genes in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.600" end="00:07:33.640" style="s2">a rauzein veil of ignorance situation</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:36.040" style="s2">where genes don&#39;t make rules that favor</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.640" end="00:07:37.510" style="s2">males over females because half the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.040" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">they&#39;ll be in a female form and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.510" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">therefore it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">do it that&#39;s the situation we find</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:46.780" style="s2">ourselves in for the most part and so it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:49.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean history hasn&#39;t been very</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.780" end="00:07:51.070" style="s2">unfair to females it has in some ways it</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.180" end="00:07:53.110" style="s2">has been unfair to males in some other</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.070" end="00:07:56.880" style="s2">ways it is time for us to renegotiate</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.110" end="00:07:59.350" style="s2">this deal between the sexes but</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.880" end="00:08:02.950" style="s2">understanding how deep the biology of</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.810" end="00:08:12.310" style="s2">worth our consideration in navigating</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.310" end="00:08:18.580" style="s2">so I feel like both of these should</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.540" end="00:08:20.320" style="s2">should warrant much longer conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.580" end="00:08:21.580" style="s2">and indeed I want to take slight issue</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:08.709" style="s2">what the term means we have we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.000" end="00:10:10.990" style="s2">have patriarchal structures rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.709" end="00:10:13.570" style="s2">matriarchal structures but that does not</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.990" end="00:10:15.640" style="s2">mean that you know we&#39;re living in a</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.620" end="00:10:21.250" style="s2">which was the sort of cartoon version</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.250" end="00:10:25.270" style="s2">young feminists wouldn&#39;t make sense for</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.900" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">men to do it and they don&#39;t do it but it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.270" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that men haven&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:31.029" style="s2">with some perfectly ridiculous solutions</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:34.270" style="s2">to problems unacceptable stuff but um</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.029" end="00:10:36.610" style="s2">but consider the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.270" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">patriarchy as it is wheeled wielded in</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.610" end="00:10:43.089" style="s2">common parlance is a myth that obscures</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">a much more interesting and nuanced set</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.089" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">of questions about the predicament that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">men and women find themselves in today</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:52.570" style="s2">so the second thing that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">take a slight issue with is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.570" end="00:10:57.430" style="s2">that only the y chromosome is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.300" end="00:10:59.770" style="s2">knowing where it&#39;s from and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.430" end="00:11:01.510" style="s2">mean you you know this but the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.770" end="00:11:04.329" style="s2">you said it it sounded like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.510" end="00:11:05.180" style="s2">ability for genes to track their</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.329" end="00:11:07.100" style="s2">effectively there</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.180" end="00:11:08.750" style="s2">heritage and we know you this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.100" end="00:11:11.810" style="s2">genomic imprinting which emerged from</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.750" end="00:11:13.400" style="s2">the David Haig Lab in the 90s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.810" end="00:11:16.750" style="s2">but when we were in graduate school a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.400" end="00:11:19.460" style="s2">little bit before suggest that actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.750" end="00:11:22.010" style="s2">particular genes can track who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.460" end="00:11:23.780" style="s2">who they&#39;re from and actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.010" end="00:11:26.900" style="s2">paternal genes are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.780" end="00:11:29.350" style="s2">produce bigger babies the stealing</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.900" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">stealing taking more of mothers resource</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.350" end="00:11:34.970" style="s2">for this baby especially in species or</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">in populations where you don&#39;t have pair</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.970" end="00:11:38.180" style="s2">bonds and where the father of this baby</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:40.490" style="s2">may not be the father of the next baby</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.180" end="00:11:44.840" style="s2">by the same mother so the Y chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.490" end="00:11:47.480" style="s2">is certainly only ever in in males in</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.840" end="00:11:50.360" style="s2">mammals but there are other mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.480" end="00:11:53.060" style="s2">by which genes can effectively keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.360" end="00:11:55.310" style="s2">track of who they came from although any</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.060" end="00:11:57.830" style="s2">individual gene could have probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.310" end="00:12:00.260" style="s2">spent equal time in men and women in its</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.830" end="00:12:02.900" style="s2">history so let me fix what I said that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.260" end="00:12:05.420" style="s2">it is true that they are not the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.900" end="00:12:07.340" style="s2">genes that can know but they are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.420" end="00:12:11.330" style="s2">only genes in which we expect the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.340" end="00:12:13.640" style="s2">sequence itself to be modified by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.330" end="00:12:14.900" style="s2">reliable fact of having come from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:16.100" style="s2">father and so for those of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:17.870" style="s2">finding this all mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.100" end="00:12:21.290" style="s2">the amazing thing about the Y chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.870" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">is that it has one really important gene</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.290" end="00:12:27.110" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.490" end="00:12:29.180" style="s2">it&#39;s the sry gene or the tlg in testes</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.110" end="00:12:31.340" style="s2">determining locus this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.180" end="00:12:33.710" style="s2">tells the rest of the genome hey guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.340" end="00:12:36.050" style="s2">what you&#39;re a male go down the male</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.710" end="00:12:39.830" style="s2">pathway and so it affects what the rest</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.050" end="00:12:41.900" style="s2">of the the genome transcribes it affects</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.830" end="00:12:44.390" style="s2">everything else but it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.900" end="00:12:46.130" style="s2">signal that says go down this pathway</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.390" end="00:12:48.650" style="s2">and the absence of that social condition</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.130" end="00:12:50.030" style="s2">yep in the absence of that signal you go</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.650" end="00:12:52.220" style="s2">down the other pathway which is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.030" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">default pathway which is female and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.220" end="00:12:55.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not that there are no other</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.720" end="00:12:58.760" style="s2">sequences on it but there&#39;s precious</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.370" end="00:13:01.610" style="s2">little on the y chromosome and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.760" end="00:13:05.260" style="s2">important thing is this the single locus</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.610" end="00:13:08.930" style="s2">and so it does appear like a kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.930" end="00:13:11.720" style="s2">the genome which is rich with</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.040" end="00:13:14.630" style="s2">information of all kinds much of which</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.720" end="00:13:17.540" style="s2">we don&#39;t yet understand this one thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.630" end="00:13:20.870" style="s2">is a gene NAC</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.540" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">of not very interesting stuff and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.870" end="00:13:26.230" style="s2">that is in and of itself a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.230" style="s2">and conspicuous fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.279" end="00:13:31.350" style="s2">all right next question is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.069" end="00:13:32.699" style="s2">evolutionary process searching for</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.350" end="00:13:34.889" style="s2">something pertaining to divergent</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.699" end="00:13:38.129" style="s2">cognition such as high-functioning</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.889" end="00:13:39.660" style="s2">autism or Asperger&#39;s our non-stem</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.129" end="00:13:41.490" style="s2">analysis methods intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.660" end="00:13:44.759" style="s2">inadequate to engage with cognition</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.490" end="00:13:46.939" style="s2">based analysis instead versus race or</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.759" end="00:13:46.939" style="s2">gender</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.990" end="00:13:52.220" style="s2">they don&#39;t totally get it new you having</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.100" end="00:13:54.140" style="s2">a hard time parsing this one I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.220" end="00:13:58.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some pieces I spot in there so</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.140" end="00:14:00.590" style="s2">you want to go with that yeah so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.040" end="00:14:02.870" style="s2">know whether you know what we call</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.590" end="00:14:06.050" style="s2">high-functioning autism or Asperger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.870" end="00:14:08.420" style="s2">syndrome is really a pathological state</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.050" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">at all right it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.420" end="00:14:15.770" style="s2">some sort of built-in low frequency</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:18.400" style="s2">useful at a lineage level phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:20.750" style="s2">then maybe the connection to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.400" end="00:14:23.210" style="s2">debilitating autism or severely</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.750" end="00:14:24.950" style="s2">debilitating autism is not what it seems</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.210" end="00:14:27.800" style="s2">because we could not afford a job of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.950" end="00:14:28.820" style="s2">figuring out what the ideology is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.800" end="00:14:32.060" style="s2">there that work and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.820" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">actually out there live among many</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.060" end="00:14:37.280" style="s2">psychologists the idea this is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:39.800" style="s2">actually a spectrum but really at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.280" end="00:14:41.570" style="s2">to perhaps multiple distinct things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.800" end="00:14:44.060" style="s2">and so anyway I guess I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.570" end="00:14:46.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a caution which is especially in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.060" end="00:14:49.070" style="s2">places like psychology it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.490" end="00:14:53.390" style="s2">psychologies fault initially but it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.070" end="00:14:55.640" style="s2">much easier to be descriptive in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.390" end="00:14:58.220" style="s2">realm of something like the mind and its</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:15:00.020" style="s2">functioning than it is to be mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.220" end="00:15:02.410" style="s2">because Minds differ a lot even when</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.020" end="00:15:04.700" style="s2">they work functionally in a similar way</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.410" end="00:15:06.530" style="s2">and so anyway we end up defining</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.700" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">syndromes and then we discover that our</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.530" end="00:15:11.060" style="s2">definitions create some sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:14.540" style="s2">incompatibility when we bring them to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.060" end="00:15:16.040" style="s2">logical extreme and so anyway beware</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.540" end="00:15:18.130" style="s2">that when somebody says something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.040" end="00:15:21.890" style="s2">autism they&#39;re not saying something</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.130" end="00:15:23.450" style="s2">specific like RNAi right they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.890" end="00:15:25.160" style="s2">something that might be at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.450" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">a syndrome and a syndrome might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.160" end="00:15:28.280" style="s2">triggered by multiple things and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:31.130" style="s2">therefore have different meanings and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.280" end="00:15:33.260" style="s2">anyway you may be looking at something</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.130" end="00:15:35.420" style="s2">that has a rare adaptive form that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.260" end="00:15:37.430" style="s2">call Asperger&#39;s and then a pathological</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.420" end="00:15:39.470" style="s2">form that we call autism and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.430" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">spectrum at all but it has some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.470" end="00:15:44.960" style="s2">overlap yeah and I guess the more and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:47.030" style="s2">look at the first brightest question the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.960" end="00:15:50.090" style="s2">evolutionary process is not searching</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.030" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">for divergent cognition per se but as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.090" end="00:15:58.750" style="s2">have as we have said elsewhere in Ellis</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:16:00.499" style="s2">times else when I guess humans are both</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.750" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">highly specialized in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.499" end="00:16:05.449" style="s2">I&#39;m a generalist and we managed to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:08.059" style="s2">both in part by being so social by</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.449" end="00:16:12.139" style="s2">living in such tight-knit groups and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.059" end="00:16:13.999" style="s2">having one or a few members of a group</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.139" end="00:16:16.129" style="s2">having what you&#39;re calling your</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.999" end="00:16:17.869" style="s2">divergent cognition in one of a variety</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.129" end="00:16:19.699" style="s2">of ways is I mean we have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.869" end="00:16:23.119" style="s2">before you know it might be might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.699" end="00:16:25.189" style="s2">dyslexia or left handedness or or being</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.119" end="00:16:28.729" style="s2">on the autism spectrum or any number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.189" end="00:16:30.139" style="s2">things may well allow for a greater</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.729" end="00:16:32.979" style="s2">problem solving and may actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.139" end="00:16:35.779" style="s2">population&#39;s road into the shamanistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.979" end="00:16:38.089" style="s2">when if the rest of the population is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.779" end="00:16:41.509" style="s2">quite embedded than the orthodoxy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.089" end="00:16:45.649" style="s2">I&#39;m the sacred so I can translate that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.509" end="00:16:50.179" style="s2">into our usual language the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.649" end="00:16:53.979" style="s2">process builds mechanisms that search so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.179" end="00:16:58.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve called that Explorer modes and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.979" end="00:17:00.259" style="s2">could something like autism or left</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.159" end="00:17:02.059" style="s2">handedness or collective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.259" end="00:17:04.069" style="s2">all of these things play some role and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.059" end="00:17:07.009" style="s2">so how the how these things interface is</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.069" end="00:17:08.089" style="s2">a little hard to say but but somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.009" end="00:17:13.010" style="s2">in the neighborhood of your question</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.089" end="00:17:15.169" style="s2">seems to be a potentially right concept</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.010" end="00:17:17.030" style="s2">well finding a cure for cancer proved to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.169" end="00:17:19.400" style="s2">be impossible does cancer somehow</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.030" end="00:17:21.110" style="s2">fundamentally serve life thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.400" end="00:17:23.480" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.110" end="00:17:26.569" style="s2">no it doesn&#39;t serve life yes it will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.480" end="00:17:29.150" style="s2">impossible to cure it it does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.569" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">that it will be impossible to render it</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.150" end="00:17:36.620" style="s2">manageable so in my paper on telomeres I</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">believe it made the final final version</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.620" end="00:17:47.330" style="s2">of the paper we proposed the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:50.690" style="s2">of extending lifespans by elongating</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.330" end="00:17:52.940" style="s2">telomeres which would only be tolerable</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.690" end="00:17:56.030" style="s2">in the case that you were very good at</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.940" end="00:17:58.030" style="s2">managing tumors so early that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.030" end="00:18:00.169" style="s2">trivial matter to deal with them so</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.030" end="00:18:02.090" style="s2">imagine for example and there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.169" end="00:18:05.350" style="s2">you can&#39;t do this yet and shouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.090" end="00:18:09.290" style="s2">dry yet but imagine that you went for</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.350" end="00:18:11.720" style="s2">regular body scans that found a reliable</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.290" end="00:18:16.760" style="s2">signature of something that had crossed</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.720" end="00:18:18.470" style="s2">over into tumorigenesis and that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.760" end="00:18:20.630" style="s2">was a mechanism for dealing with those</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.470" end="00:18:22.100" style="s2">things when they were tiny and that your</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.630" end="00:18:24.710" style="s2">scans were regular enough that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">ever got beyond tiny well it might be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.710" end="00:18:29.450" style="s2">that you could then deal with all those</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.750" end="00:18:31.429" style="s2">cancers in a way that didn&#39;t matter to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.450" end="00:18:33.350" style="s2">you and you could get some extra youth</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.429" end="00:18:36.260" style="s2">because basically you&#39;d borrowed from</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.350" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">this new capacity you wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.260" end="00:18:40.040" style="s2">do anything you would want to try</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:43.220" style="s2">anything like this right now because in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.040" end="00:18:46.070" style="s2">all probability proto tumors which is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.220" end="00:18:48.380" style="s2">term I tried to coin in that paper which</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.070" end="00:18:51.470" style="s2">are things that are not tumors but they</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.380" end="00:18:53.929" style="s2">are basically one mutation shy these are</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.470" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">round growths that probably exist in</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.929" end="00:18:57.290" style="s2">almost every tissue in the body on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">surface of our skin they would be moles</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:00.710" style="s2">they would be colorful and your liver</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:02.210" style="s2">you&#39;d never know they were there unless</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.710" end="00:19:05.179" style="s2">somebody went in with a microscope and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.210" end="00:19:08.390" style="s2">looked right but these things are likely</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.179" end="00:19:10.220" style="s2">to be so common that if you got a scan</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.390" end="00:19:11.690" style="s2">and you look for all sorts of growths</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.220" end="00:19:13.460" style="s2">that were out of place you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.690" end="00:19:15.140" style="s2">probably find so many of them that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.460" end="00:19:17.299" style="s2">be overwhelmed and even if you set some</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.140" end="00:19:18.470" style="s2">threshold where you could ignore most of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.299" end="00:19:19.170" style="s2">the ones that we&#39;re never going to harm</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.470" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.170" end="00:19:27.450" style="s2">you would still be constantly facing</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:29.010" style="s2">false positives where you think you had</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.450" end="00:19:31.320" style="s2">some cancer that needed to be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.010" end="00:19:32.730" style="s2">and in fact what you had was some growth</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:35.160" style="s2">that would never bother you would never</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.730" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">cause a pathology so we&#39;re not anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.160" end="00:19:40.140" style="s2">near this but is it conceivable that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:44.130" style="s2">the future body scans could be good</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.140" end="00:19:46.110" style="s2">enough and techniques that using the</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.110" end="00:19:49.740" style="s2">is surgically dealt with only that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:52.680" style="s2">tissue would question and didn&#39;t cause a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.740" end="00:19:54.690" style="s2">larger wound could be so good that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.680" end="00:19:57.590" style="s2">could extend human lifespans this way</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.690" end="00:19:57.590" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s conceivable</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.360" end="00:20:02.050" style="s2">next question I am interested in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.610" end="00:20:04.420" style="s2">pursuing research in mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.050" end="00:20:05.590" style="s2">modeling of biological systems I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.420" end="00:20:07.150" style="s2">just wondering if you have anything more</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.590" end="00:20:09.100" style="s2">to say on this there any warnings you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.150" end="00:20:11.370" style="s2">give me any trap so might easily fall</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.100" end="00:20:14.670" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.370" end="00:20:17.130" style="s2">oh boy I mean I got to you got to hang</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.670" end="00:20:20.090" style="s2">up to I mean I the thing that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.130" end="00:20:20.090" style="s2">for me first is</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:31.290" style="s2">that the few modelers that I have known</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.180" end="00:20:34.200" style="s2">at all have not have not been focused on</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.290" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">hypothesis and that I don&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.200" end="00:20:37.380" style="s2">know them before they were modelers so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:41.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it was drummed out of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.380" end="00:20:42.900" style="s2">by by being being a modeler or if they</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.250" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">went into it sort of that with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.900" end="00:20:46.770" style="s2">data-driven approach rather than I</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:48.900" style="s2">bought the SIS driven approach and there</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.770" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">is nothing inherently about modeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.900" end="00:20:53.700" style="s2">that should that can&#39;t be hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">driven but that it looks at just</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.700" end="00:21:00.120" style="s2">anecdotally to me like those being</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:01.970" style="s2">hypothesis driven and being a modeler</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.120" end="00:21:04.530" style="s2">aren&#39;t living particularly well</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:06.270" style="s2">side-by-side that much the detriment of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.530" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">the accuracy of the models that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.270" end="00:21:12.600" style="s2">using so you know keep hypotheses front</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:14.520" style="s2">and center in your mind yeah predictably</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.600" end="00:21:18.290" style="s2">enough going to have a similar message</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.520" end="00:21:21.480" style="s2">which is models can be made to mirror</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.290" end="00:21:24.330" style="s2">behaviors that they do not actually tell</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.480" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">us anything about if you include enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.330" end="00:21:27.420" style="s2">parameters in the model you can get them</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:28.860" style="s2">to spit out behaviors that look like</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.420" end="00:21:33.270" style="s2">just about any natural thing you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.860" end="00:21:36.780" style="s2">find so the utility of models is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.270" end="00:21:39.510" style="s2">generating hypotheses that then require</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.780" end="00:21:42.630" style="s2">a test in very simple cases you can use</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.510" end="00:21:44.340" style="s2">a model to test certain ideas but as</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.630" end="00:21:47.250" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with something complex</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.340" end="00:21:49.950" style="s2">like biology tends to be you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.250" end="00:21:51.810" style="s2">take a model and use it for its highest</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.950" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">and best use which is the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.810" end="00:21:57.390" style="s2">possibilities which you then test in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:22:00.060" style="s2">nature and so what Heather is responding</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.390" end="00:22:03.510" style="s2">to is that the tendency is to use models</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.060" end="00:22:05.430" style="s2">as a cheaper way of accessing nature as</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.510" end="00:22:10.050" style="s2">if they were true and the assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.430" end="00:22:12.270" style="s2">just aren&#39;t supported so beware of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.050" end="00:22:13.890" style="s2">problem of making models that mirror the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.270" end="00:22:15.570" style="s2">behavior for the wrong reasons not</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.890" end="00:22:17.910" style="s2">because they are internally not like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.570" end="00:22:20.310" style="s2">system in question and I should also say</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.910" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">be aware that model means really two</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.310" end="00:22:24.530" style="s2">different things you say mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:27.060" style="s2">model I take that to mean computer model</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.530" end="00:22:29.910" style="s2">I&#39;d generate models and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.060" end="00:22:32.310" style="s2">useful but the point is the model is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.910" end="00:22:33.240" style="s2">description of the way a system might</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.310" end="00:22:35.550" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.240" end="00:22:38.460" style="s2">and then the hypotheses get tested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.550" end="00:22:40.050" style="s2">nature and if they if they give you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.460" end="00:22:41.790" style="s2">predictions that actually turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.050" end="00:22:44.700" style="s2">manifest in nature especially if those</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.790" end="00:22:47.910" style="s2">predictions are surprising they reflect</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.700" end="00:22:51.650" style="s2">well on the whole model so my model of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.910" end="00:22:55.950" style="s2">telomere senescence and cancer was</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.650" end="00:22:59.790" style="s2">bolstered by the demonstration by human</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.950" end="00:23:02.220" style="s2">and Grider that lab mouse telomeres were</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.790" end="00:23:05.100" style="s2">anomalous and that wild mice had short</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.220" end="00:23:06.810" style="s2">telomeres that prediction does have lots</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.100" end="00:23:08.520" style="s2">of interesting implications but to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.810" end="00:23:10.470" style="s2">the most important was that it reflected</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.520" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">well on the larger model which said</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.470" end="00:23:16.950" style="s2">something about life history strategies</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:21.000" style="s2">in creatures like us so two different</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.950" end="00:23:22.890" style="s2">kinds of models what do you think is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">most accurate assessment of COBIT 19</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.890" end="00:23:31.080" style="s2">mortality rates as best and it&#39;s very I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:34.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know you know I I mentioned that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.080" end="00:23:37.200" style="s2">think sort of off the cuff I said that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.410" end="00:23:39.480" style="s2">it appears to have a case fatality rate</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:40.800" style="s2">which mortality rate is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.480" end="00:23:42.780" style="s2">looser term but a case fatality rate</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.800" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">being just what percentage of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.780" end="00:23:48.870" style="s2">infected died something like four to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:49.350" style="s2">five times that of flu it could be ten</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.870" end="00:23:52.740" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.350" end="00:23:54.990" style="s2">I think there&#39;s I don&#39;t think we will</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.740" end="00:23:57.090" style="s2">find that it has been during this time</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.990" end="00:23:59.550" style="s2">during the time of the pandemic anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.090" end="00:24:01.980" style="s2">closer to that of the flu it may it may</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.550" end="00:24:03.780" style="s2">come to that you know it mate within a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.980" end="00:24:05.310" style="s2">year from now if it&#39;s still here if it</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.780" end="00:24:08.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t disappear which some</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.310" end="00:24:10.650" style="s2">coronaviruses do it may end up</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.820" end="00:24:13.140" style="s2">equilibrating at something close to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.650" end="00:24:16.110" style="s2">CFR for flu but I think it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.140" end="00:24:19.230" style="s2">something right will have been something</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.110" end="00:24:22.260" style="s2">right now around something like a half a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.230" end="00:24:24.930" style="s2">percent but I honestly don&#39;t put a ton</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.260" end="00:24:27.090" style="s2">of confidence in that estimate yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.930" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">again I&#39;m gonna dodge the question and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.090" end="00:24:32.430" style="s2">say I am suspicious that different</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.840" end="00:24:34.440" style="s2">strains may differ and that may be</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.430" end="00:24:37.170" style="s2">throwing us different locales may differ</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.440" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">that change over time will cause the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.170" end="00:24:40.530" style="s2">number to shift and even if change over</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">time did not cause the number to shift</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.530" end="00:24:45.630" style="s2">that our understanding of the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.919" style="s2">and their meaning will cause our</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.630" end="00:24:50.129" style="s2">treatment of it too</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.919" end="00:24:51.989" style="s2">better so for example let&#39;s say I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.129" end="00:24:55.769" style="s2">saying this is true not a doctor don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.989" end="00:25:01.789" style="s2">know but if it was true that people with</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.769" end="00:25:01.789" style="s2">severe respiratory SARS co2 infection</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.940" end="00:25:06.530" style="s2">tend to present as somebody in need of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:08.360" style="s2">ventilator but the ventilator makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.530" end="00:25:10.220" style="s2">matters worse and we learn not to put</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.360" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">people on them you would expect the case</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.220" end="00:25:17.140" style="s2">fatality rate to go down as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.440" end="00:25:20.450" style="s2">our painfully earned knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.140" end="00:25:22.190" style="s2">anyway no doubt there are dozens of ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.450" end="00:25:24.890" style="s2">in which we are learning how to treat</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.190" end="00:25:26.540" style="s2">people better than we were in the early</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.890" end="00:25:29.390" style="s2">phases of this which should drive the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.540" end="00:25:30.500" style="s2">CFR down so yeah well there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.390" end="00:25:32.840" style="s2">so this is something we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.500" end="00:25:34.210" style="s2">and maybe deserves more time in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.840" end="00:25:35.930" style="s2">regular part of a future episode</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.210" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">although at some point we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.930" end="00:25:41.690" style="s2">start veering away from code of 19 and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.820" end="00:25:44.540" style="s2">talking more about other things this</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.690" end="00:25:47.270" style="s2">virus seems at least capable of and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.540" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">quite likely is mutating very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:51.380" style="s2">quickly it is spread fast into many</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:54.770" style="s2">different domains across many different</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.380" end="00:25:56.870" style="s2">types of environments and we know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.770" end="00:25:58.340" style="s2">know the genome has been mapped in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.870" end="00:26:03.530" style="s2">number of strains and we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.340" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">changing fast that that put that right</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.530" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">next to the fact that we keep hearing</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.960" end="00:26:11.060" style="s2">that both the tests for active infection</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:14.780" style="s2">the antigen tests and tests for past</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.060" end="00:26:17.750" style="s2">infection the antibody tests are wildly</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:19.250" style="s2">variable in their accuracy that you you</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.750" end="00:26:21.380" style="s2">know you don&#39;t you can&#39;t just say okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.250" end="00:26:23.390" style="s2">this one has a 2% false positive and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.380" end="00:26:25.820" style="s2">1% false negative these tests just seem</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.390" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">to be wildly variable so what might that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.820" end="00:26:30.890" style="s2">be about why is this white like it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:32.450" style="s2">thing to try to find a vaccine and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.890" end="00:26:34.220" style="s2">talked before about how difficult it may</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.450" end="00:26:36.680" style="s2">be and how we may never get one but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.220" end="00:26:39.530" style="s2">know hopefully we do but why are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.680" end="00:26:44.090" style="s2">tests so bad the tests as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.530" end="00:26:46.730" style="s2">about right may be bad because using a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.090" end="00:26:48.440" style="s2">test developed for one strain will not</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.270" end="00:26:54.980" style="s2">fast and the piece of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.970" end="00:26:56.450" style="s2">whatever it is that the test is looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.980" end="00:26:58.970" style="s2">at it doesn&#39;t happen to be in the new</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.450" end="00:27:00.380" style="s2">strain we may get mu may be getting you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.970" end="00:27:01.430" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t get false positives this way</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.380" end="00:27:04.490" style="s2">but you would get a whole lot of false</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.430" end="00:27:06.620" style="s2">negatives so if you had and likely it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.490" end="00:27:08.330" style="s2">would be mostly the serology tests the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.620" end="00:27:10.940" style="s2">tests that were antibody testing per</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.330" end="00:27:13.070" style="s2">passed infection and that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.940" end="00:27:15.530" style="s2">if that were true that would mean that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.070" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">the background rate of infection</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.530" end="00:27:18.860" style="s2">many parts the world was much higher</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">than it appears to be and that would</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.860" end="00:27:22.040" style="s2">also you know once the denominator goes</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:24.530" style="s2">up that means the case fatality rate</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.040" end="00:27:27.560" style="s2">goes down but that also mean it just has</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.530" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">huge epidemiological implications if</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.560" end="00:27:31.580" style="s2">it&#39;s true if a whole bunch of people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">felt like they probably were sick</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.580" end="00:27:35.900" style="s2">actually were sick even though the tests</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:38.300" style="s2">are coming back negative and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.900" end="00:27:39.740" style="s2">bunch of people therefore who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.300" end="00:27:41.510" style="s2">think they were sick probably were as</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.740" end="00:27:43.580" style="s2">well but perhaps the tests that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.510" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">using were made in one part of the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.580" end="00:27:46.730" style="s2">of one part of the country that had had</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:47.930" style="s2">a different strain than the one that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.730" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">in the further world they&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.930" end="00:27:52.160" style="s2">so this is a possibility that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:56.810" style="s2">heard anywhere else except in our house</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.160" end="00:27:58.100" style="s2">and it&#39;s it makes this question you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.810" end="00:28:00.020" style="s2">what&#39;s the most accurate assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.100" end="00:28:03.320" style="s2">copa90 mortality rates even harder to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.020" end="00:28:07.130" style="s2">get close to it does and also suggests</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.320" end="00:28:08.750" style="s2">yet again that we were at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.130" end="00:28:11.540" style="s2">right neighborhood when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.750" end="00:28:13.550" style="s2">about the Theodore Roosevelt the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.540" end="00:28:16.730" style="s2">aircraft carrier that had an outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.550" end="00:28:19.610" style="s2">and the lost opportunity of a population</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.730" end="00:28:20.840" style="s2">of exactly known dimension that could</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.610" end="00:28:24.440" style="s2">have been followed in order to figure</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.840" end="00:28:26.270" style="s2">out how these patterns actually work so</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.440" end="00:28:27.770" style="s2">I guess the point would be look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.270" end="00:28:30.230" style="s2">still not too late to start</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.770" end="00:28:32.510" style="s2">carefully tracking some populations so</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.230" end="00:28:35.630" style="s2">well that you could establish who had</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.510" end="00:28:39.740" style="s2">had an infection you know frankly by you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.630" end="00:28:41.390" style="s2">know viral shedding or whatever and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.740" end="00:28:44.030" style="s2">we could test the hypothesis that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.390" end="00:28:46.270" style="s2">tests are you know inaccurate in an</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.030" end="00:28:49.610" style="s2">inconsistent way based on what strain</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.270" end="00:28:52.850" style="s2">you had versus what strain the test was</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.610" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">built for yeah so anyway still a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.850" end="00:29:00.260" style="s2">idea and if not for this pandemic then</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:29:02.630" style="s2">for the next one next question the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.260" end="00:29:04.040" style="s2">YouTube video mathematical challenges to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.630" end="00:29:05.780" style="s2">Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.040" end="00:29:08.090" style="s2">scholarly discussion at the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.780" end="00:29:09.920" style="s2">mathematical impossibility of Darwin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.090" end="00:29:11.690" style="s2">theory is this a reasonable challenge</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.920" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">the theory is this a new idea you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.690" end="00:29:14.810" style="s2">nodding as if you know the video I do I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:16.310" style="s2">looked it up to make sure it was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.810" end="00:29:19.010" style="s2">video I was thinking of oh when you saw</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.310" end="00:29:22.040" style="s2">the question yeah it&#39;s uh David Glanton</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.010" end="00:29:24.560" style="s2">er David Berlinski and Stephen Meyer oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.040" end="00:29:26.060" style="s2">it&#39;s that one yeah it&#39;s that one okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.560" end="00:29:26.870" style="s2">alright I&#39;m now going to get in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.060" end="00:29:29.420" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.870" end="00:29:31.490" style="s2">everybody so hopefully you&#39;ll stick with</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.420" end="00:29:33.140" style="s2">me you&#39;ve committed to do that and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.490" end="00:29:35.630" style="s2">rest of you it was nice knowing ya but</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.140" end="00:29:38.150" style="s2">okay I can tell you both too they will</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.630" end="00:29:39.860" style="s2">as well and the pets I heard the animals</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.150" end="00:29:41.240" style="s2">yeah well they don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.860" end="00:29:42.170" style="s2">talking about so this won&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:46.190" style="s2">anything for them</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.170" end="00:29:48.620" style="s2">no that&#39;s true in any case I I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.190" end="00:29:52.100" style="s2">those three guys and I must say I quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.620" end="00:29:54.350" style="s2">like them there are challenges say who</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.100" end="00:29:58.460" style="s2">it is against David Gartner who</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.350" end="00:30:03.230" style="s2">triggered a wave of controversy by artis</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.460" end="00:30:04.610" style="s2">a computer math guy and he basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.230" end="00:30:07.040" style="s2">said that he had come to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.610" end="00:30:10.730" style="s2">he didn&#39;t believe that Darwinism was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.040" end="00:30:12.800" style="s2">an accurate model and of course Steven</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.730" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">Meyer of the Discovery Institute has</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.800" end="00:30:18.590" style="s2">long been searching for evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:20.660" style="s2">Darwinism is inadequate to this to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.590" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">explain life as we know it and David</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.660" end="00:30:24.290" style="s2">velinski has yet a third position none</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:27.080" style="s2">of them have the same position which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.290" end="00:30:29.900" style="s2">interesting but they&#39;re all skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.080" end="00:30:32.750" style="s2">the standard-issue Darwinian framework</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.900" end="00:30:35.330" style="s2">yeah and you know when I met these guys</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.750" end="00:30:37.130" style="s2">I told them that I thought there was</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.330" end="00:30:39.380" style="s2">something to the challenges that were</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.130" end="00:30:40.730" style="s2">being leveled not all of them but some</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.380" end="00:30:43.010" style="s2">of the challenges that were being</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.730" end="00:30:47.059" style="s2">leveled had content to them but that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.010" end="00:30:48.950" style="s2">solution actually was a deeper kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.059" end="00:30:50.540" style="s2">Darwinism that basically Darwin had been</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.950" end="00:30:52.250" style="s2">right Darwin was of course not very</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.540" end="00:30:54.700" style="s2">specific because he couldn&#39;t be in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.250" end="00:30:56.929" style="s2">absence of knowledge of how genes work</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.700" end="00:30:58.670" style="s2">but I you know I flat out told him I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.929" end="00:31:01.370" style="s2">said look this is your Waterloo are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.670" end="00:31:03.710" style="s2">ready for it and you know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.370" end="00:31:06.830" style="s2">persuaded them and they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.710" end="00:31:11.320" style="s2">persuaded me but the thing that I find</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.830" end="00:31:13.880" style="s2">so troubling is that the field of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.320" end="00:31:20.530" style="s2">legitimate evolutionary biologists</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.880" end="00:31:23.630" style="s2">treats all of this as if it is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.530" end="00:31:26.570" style="s2">offered in good faith I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.630" end="00:31:28.429" style="s2">this is the case in any of these in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.570" end="00:31:30.410" style="s2">case of any of these three people they</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.429" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">are all skeptical for their own reasons</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.410" end="00:31:34.550" style="s2">I believe they are in the end wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that every challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.550" end="00:31:40.260" style="s2">incorrect and you know challenges like</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:42.390" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.260" end="00:31:44.190" style="s2">is there enough time given the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.390" end="00:31:47.820" style="s2">mechanisms that are presented in order</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.190" end="00:31:49.320" style="s2">for the for adaptation to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.820" end="00:31:52.260" style="s2">discovered the various things that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.320" end="00:31:54.210" style="s2">credit to it if that is the if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.260" end="00:31:56.790" style="s2">mechanisms involved are the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.210" end="00:31:59.760" style="s2">described in the textbook I think this</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.790" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">is actually a fair challenge and to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.760" end="00:32:05.070" style="s2">extent that the field discovers that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:06.809" style="s2">mechanisms we already have in discussion</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.070" end="00:32:08.370" style="s2">are perfectly adequate the field will</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.809" end="00:32:10.830" style="s2">become stronger for having demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.370" end="00:32:12.750" style="s2">that and to the extent that we find out</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.830" end="00:32:14.820" style="s2">that actually there is something there</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.750" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">is a gap between what we claim is being</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.820" end="00:32:19.130" style="s2">explained and the mechanism that we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:22.770" style="s2">said explained it that points directly</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.130" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">to another mechanism now my point is</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.770" end="00:32:26.850" style="s2">that mechanism is Darwinian it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:30.540" style="s2">different Darwinian mechanism Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.850" end="00:32:32.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t say you know DNA to protein was</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.540" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">the only Darwinian mechanism he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.610" end="00:32:38.309" style="s2">have any position on it because he</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:40.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t know about DNA so my point would</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.309" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">be there is a missing mechanism it does</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.620" end="00:32:45.780" style="s2">render the story that we tell about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:47.669" style="s2">Darwinism works inadequate and that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.780" end="00:32:49.230" style="s2">effect the solution involves what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.669" end="00:32:53.220" style="s2">have called Explorer modes that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.230" end="00:32:55.260" style="s2">basically over time the route Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.220" end="00:32:57.870" style="s2">discovers more and more effective ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.260" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">of exploring design space and so it</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.870" end="00:33:02.190" style="s2">finds solutions faster than it would if</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:04.380" style="s2">it was doing this totally haphazard</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.190" end="00:33:06.840" style="s2">thing where you know you&#39;ve all heard</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.380" end="00:33:08.850" style="s2">the story right there are lots of</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.850" end="00:33:12.870" style="s2">often one of them is good those good</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">ones off and go extinct anyway yes they</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:20.309" style="s2">ultimately produces things like wings</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.580" end="00:33:22.380" style="s2">and eyes and all of that and my point</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.309" end="00:33:24.840" style="s2">would be now Darwinism produces those</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.380" end="00:33:27.330" style="s2">things but it isn&#39;t that simple random</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.840" end="00:33:29.490" style="s2">mutation mechanism it&#39;s other ways that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.330" end="00:33:33.450" style="s2">Darwinism has given rise to exploration</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.490" end="00:33:35.549" style="s2">of design space and I think frankly as</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.450" end="00:33:38.700" style="s2">much as some of the critiques offered by</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.549" end="00:33:42.690" style="s2">Gartner and and Berlinski</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.700" end="00:33:46.380" style="s2">and Myers are I think dead ends and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.690" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">accurate no I&#39;m not I&#39;m not concerned</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.380" end="00:33:51.030" style="s2">about the Cambrian explosion for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:52.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.030" end="00:33:56.550" style="s2">to the extent that some of their</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.920" end="00:33:58.680" style="s2">critiques actually really do stand up to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.550" end="00:34:00.660" style="s2">scrutiny the field should take them</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.680" end="00:34:03.090" style="s2">seriously these are decent people and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.660" end="00:34:04.890" style="s2">they&#39;re offering the produces people and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.090" end="00:34:07.050" style="s2">very smart people who are not who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.890" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">not naive about the level of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.050" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">that they&#39;re thinking about yes well I</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:13.770" style="s2">mean look two of them are not biologists</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:16.590" style="s2">right some of their critiques actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.770" end="00:34:19.590" style="s2">are fairly easily dealt with one of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.590" end="00:34:23.100" style="s2">is a biologist and a very good one right</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.590" end="00:34:25.290" style="s2">now he does have a take he&#39;s he has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.100" end="00:34:27.000" style="s2">particular thought which is that design</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.290" end="00:34:29.580" style="s2">is the explanation and I think he will</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.000" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">turn out to be dead wrong but but</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.580" end="00:34:35.280" style="s2">nonetheless the quality of the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:39.360" style="s2">that he brings to bear is higher than</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:40.919" style="s2">you would expect yeah so I&#39;d like to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.360" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">through at least the 20 other questions</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.919" end="00:34:46.370" style="s2">here so we had a lot more let&#39;s do a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:46.370" style="s2">little fast and go to the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.930" end="00:34:54.340" style="s2">well I just lost or I was off can you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.600" end="00:34:55.780" style="s2">tell me how seemingly complex animal</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.340" end="00:35:00.910" style="s2">instincts evolved that are inherited</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.780" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">Thanks not quickly I mean I think I</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.910" end="00:35:05.740" style="s2">think you kind of just got there</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:08.530" style="s2">actually with the last question yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.740" end="00:35:11.800" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like everything else and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.530" end="00:35:14.890" style="s2">know darkness does a good job with you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.800" end="00:35:17.770" style="s2">know as a beautiful job in fact on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.890" end="00:35:19.840" style="s2">eye and how you get to an eye with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.770" end="00:35:22.060" style="s2">challenge that we&#39;ve all heard you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.840" end="00:35:23.320" style="s2">if half an eye is of no value how could</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.060" end="00:35:25.690" style="s2">you possibly get to an eye and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.320" end="00:35:29.800" style="s2">out half an eye is of great value and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.690" end="00:35:32.680" style="s2">being able to spot how small differences</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.800" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">in capacity could accumulate with no</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.680" end="00:35:37.930" style="s2">places where there is a big jump</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:40.860" style="s2">downward in utility that&#39;s the basic</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.930" end="00:35:43.840" style="s2">answer and so you know a crude ability</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.860" end="00:35:46.270" style="s2">to deploy some program in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.840" end="00:35:48.850" style="s2">you might call an instinct that has some</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.270" end="00:35:50.710" style="s2">tendency to adjust the probability of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.850" end="00:35:52.810" style="s2">finding food or whatever in your favor</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.710" end="00:35:54.700" style="s2">that gets refined over time into</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.810" end="00:35:56.950" style="s2">something that&#39;s almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.700" end="00:35:58.750" style="s2">imagine but if you saw all the steps</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.950" end="00:36:01.330" style="s2">you&#39;d get it yeah and I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.750" end="00:36:03.100" style="s2">there&#39;s something if I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.330" end="00:36:05.860" style="s2">the questioner is so I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.100" end="00:36:08.500" style="s2">they&#39;ve used the language here with with</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.860" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">intentional precision and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.500" end="00:36:12.370" style="s2">instinct instance is one of these words</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:14.140" style="s2">that often animal behaviorists don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.370" end="00:36:18.100" style="s2">anymore because there&#39;s very little that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.140" end="00:36:21.580" style="s2">is just completely programmed in at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.100" end="00:36:23.530" style="s2">level of behaviors but complex animal</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.580" end="00:36:26.080" style="s2">instincts might actually be pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.530" end="00:36:29.170" style="s2">something that is behaviorally simple</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.080" end="00:36:31.630" style="s2">but actually requires a whole interplay</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.170" end="00:36:34.360" style="s2">of anatomical physiological endocrine</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.630" end="00:36:36.580" style="s2">illogical perhaps developmental things</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.360" end="00:36:38.680" style="s2">to come together and so you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.580" end="00:36:43.060" style="s2">you get a simple and perhaps binary</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.680" end="00:36:44.590" style="s2">outcome with a whole lot of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.060" end="00:36:46.300" style="s2">behind it and you know it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.590" end="00:36:48.460" style="s2">the same kind of answer but it is harder</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.300" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">it is harder to imagine your way there</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.460" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">and you know as as again Dawkins has</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:55.530" style="s2">said failure of imagination is not an</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:58.330" style="s2">argument but it is you know the I</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.530" end="00:37:01.570" style="s2">argument that he makes so elegantly the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.330" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">Dawkins makes so elegantly is an easier</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.570" end="00:37:05.730" style="s2">one to to grok right</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:07.530" style="s2">any ability to sense the difference</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.730" end="00:37:10.490" style="s2">between light and dark is better than no</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.530" end="00:37:14.210" style="s2">ability at all even if that first</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.490" end="00:37:17.670" style="s2">photoreceptor if any of us who are fully</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.210" end="00:37:20.819" style="s2">who have full vision we&#39;re to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.670" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">that state it would feel like a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.819" end="00:37:27.240" style="s2">loss but from total darkness it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:29.069" style="s2">great advance so when you have a system</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.240" end="00:37:30.839" style="s2">that looks like you pull out a single</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.069" end="00:37:34.349" style="s2">thing and you&#39;ve got a Jenga tower</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.839" end="00:37:37.500" style="s2">falling it&#39;s harder to imagine how it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.349" end="00:37:38.700" style="s2">worked but but with most these systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.500" end="00:37:41.880" style="s2">we can&#39;t actually live together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.700" end="00:37:43.549" style="s2">that&#39;s in fact a lot of what a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.549" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">development biologists do is figure out</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.520" end="00:40:06.460" style="s2">this case I would break out one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.670" end="00:40:09.250" style="s2">respirators that we have for no leases</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.460" end="00:40:11.230" style="s2">or carpentry or for you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.250" end="00:40:11.650" style="s2">spray and solvents or something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.230" end="00:40:14.109" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.650" end="00:40:15.730" style="s2">so these things are much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.109" end="00:40:17.319" style="s2">industrial-strength much less</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.730" end="00:40:21.700" style="s2">comfortable than the bandanna I got to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.319" end="00:40:23.829" style="s2">tell you but the problem the model for</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.700" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">the infection when I&#39;m running around</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.829" end="00:40:29.859" style="s2">with in my head at the moment is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:32.559" style="s2">some vessel that when you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.859" end="00:40:34.599" style="s2">somebody sick begins to fill and if it</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.559" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">gets above some threshold then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.599" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">likely to get sick if you keep it below</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.349" style="s2">that threshold you are unlikely to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:43.210" style="s2">sick nothing is impossible but unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.349" end="00:40:45.369" style="s2">so if you have a two-minute interaction</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.210" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">with somebody it&#39;s very very unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.369" end="00:40:50.020" style="s2">you will reach that threshold even if</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:51.730" style="s2">they&#39;re sick right but if you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.020" end="00:40:53.260" style="s2">sitting next to somebody who&#39;s sick the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.730" end="00:40:56.020" style="s2">chances that you&#39;ll get through you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.260" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">an hour flight and not reach that top</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.020" end="00:41:01.150" style="s2">level is pretty low with a you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:02.920" style="s2">respirator prevent you from getting to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.150" end="00:41:04.750" style="s2">that level I think so I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.920" end="00:41:06.369" style="s2">see it also depends on how many ways it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.750" end="00:41:11.529" style="s2">can spread you know so that the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.369" end="00:41:13.480" style="s2">emerging medical consensus which who</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.529" end="00:41:15.369" style="s2">knows if it&#39;s right but the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.480" end="00:41:17.260" style="s2">medical consensus suggests that airborne</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.369" end="00:41:20.230" style="s2">is clearly the way that this spreads</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.260" end="00:41:23.319" style="s2">most and the aerosols probably and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.230" end="00:41:25.329" style="s2">fomites the stuff on surfaces poses</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.319" end="00:41:27.820" style="s2">actually very very little risk which if</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.329" end="00:41:29.260" style="s2">true you know means that retail can open</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.820" end="00:41:31.090" style="s2">v/o things like that and it&#39;s sitting</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.260" end="00:41:33.910" style="s2">next to someone if you and they are both</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.090" end="00:41:37.080" style="s2">masked um is actually pretty safe</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.910" end="00:41:40.690" style="s2">yep well if you and they are both masked</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.080" end="00:41:42.100" style="s2">yes but I would still say in a flight</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.690" end="00:41:43.810" style="s2">and you know even an hour flight you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.100" end="00:41:47.500" style="s2">could get stuck on the tarmac for an</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.810" end="00:41:51.190" style="s2">extra hour and so you know I trust my</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.500" end="00:41:53.770" style="s2">bandana if I&#39;m in a position to limit my</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.190" end="00:41:57.190" style="s2">interaction with anybody I don&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.770" end="00:41:59.070" style="s2">I&#39;m you know blazing through a store to</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.190" end="00:42:01.840" style="s2">you know to get groceries or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.070" end="00:42:03.520" style="s2">I&#39;m in a lot of control over whether I</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:07.840" style="s2">an airplane you lose that and so I might</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:10.600" style="s2">go the extra step and and use a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.840" end="00:42:12.340" style="s2">respirator though I&#39;m not happy about</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.600" end="00:42:17.590" style="s2">that as a choice I do think it would</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.780" end="00:42:39.050" style="s2">and the schools of Education have been</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.500" end="00:42:47.000" style="s2">it that we can get you Elizabeth and</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.000" end="00:42:53.870" style="s2">system and actually teach children the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.710" end="00:42:56.450" style="s2">right thing I think you know first you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.870" end="00:42:59.000" style="s2">have to get through school and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.450" end="00:43:01.790" style="s2">probably does require some some feints</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.000" end="00:43:03.230" style="s2">some some lies about what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.790" end="00:43:04.900" style="s2">believe in that&#39;s awful that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.230" end="00:43:09.590" style="s2">education is the opposite of education</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.900" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">but once you have children you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.590" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">do that you teach them to experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">their own bodies and the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:19.970" style="s2">and learn from what they experience and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:22.100" style="s2">believe their eyes before they believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.970" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">what someone told them or what they read</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.100" end="00:43:26.990" style="s2">in a book or on the internet and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">know it depends of course what level of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.990" end="00:43:30.470" style="s2">educator you&#39;re looking to be if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.210" end="00:43:41.720" style="s2">increasingly it&#39;s tough within the k-12</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.340" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">system to do even what you know aspiring</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:49.850" style="s2">educate want to do because of because</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.090" end="00:43:53.090" style="s2">basically the authoritarian stuff coming</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.130" end="00:44:01.180" style="s2">Behind and such but are actually ways to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:04.580" style="s2">enforce orthodoxy on children and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.180" end="00:44:07.930" style="s2">believe them of passion that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.580" end="00:44:10.970" style="s2">promising answer no I would just say</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.930" end="00:44:12.440" style="s2">there is no good answer I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.970" end="00:44:15.740" style="s2">you would get through such a program I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.440" end="00:44:18.680" style="s2">certainly wouldn&#39;t on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.740" end="00:44:21.500" style="s2">what&#39;s certain to happen is the more</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.680" end="00:44:23.870" style="s2">absurd the claims become and the more</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.500" end="00:44:25.340" style="s2">ubiquitous they become in school as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.870" end="00:44:29.960" style="s2">result of the fact that the schools of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.340" end="00:44:31.820" style="s2">Ed are are selling people this nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.960" end="00:44:33.350" style="s2">the fact is people will have no choice</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.820" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">but to pull their children out of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.350" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">schools and then the schools will</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:40.340" style="s2">collapse and so I don&#39;t look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:45.320" style="s2">that period it could be the end of us</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.340" end="00:44:49.340" style="s2">because it might have a very destructive</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.320" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">effect on our body politic but but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.340" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;re very close to the end</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:55.390" style="s2">of the of the story of this pollution</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:57.890" style="s2">because it&#39;s gotten so abhorrent that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.390" end="00:44:59.840" style="s2">you know people will not tolerate it no</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.890" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">and you actually mentioned one of Toby</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.840" end="00:45:02.230" style="s2">our 14 year olds teachers in the last</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.400" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">whole section on dystopias and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.670" end="00:45:14.630" style="s2">just doing a fantastic job he&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.630" end="00:45:23.900" style="s2">but he&#39;s exposing these children to so</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.030" end="00:45:27.710" style="s2">many different forms of literature and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.900" end="00:45:30.620" style="s2">film and music that basically teach</p>

<p begin="00:45:30.620" end="00:45:35.930" style="s2">piece of course it doesn&#39;t work when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:37.940" style="s2">say okay I&#39;m going to slowly early on</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.930" end="00:45:39.890" style="s2">many thought that coronavirus had</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.250" end="00:47:23.210" style="s2">asked this before we answered that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.900" end="00:47:25.609" style="s2">question in the last one because I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.210" end="00:47:30.099" style="s2">I was certainly working with the popular</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.099" end="00:47:35.059" style="s2">but given that 77% of flu cases are</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.290" end="00:47:36.920" style="s2">asymptomatic me understand flu a lot</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.730" end="00:47:46.670" style="s2">19 cases recent Ematic so I hope really</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.010" end="00:47:54.290" style="s2">the question fact is we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.520" end="00:47:57.020" style="s2">the number of cases that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.290" end="00:48:00.530" style="s2">asymptomatic and possibly not testing</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.530" end="00:48:04.760" style="s2">just lacking yeah so it could well be</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.930" end="00:48:39.080" style="s2">just say there are several things in</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.080" end="00:48:46.890" style="s2">first of all exercise is not specific</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.640" end="00:48:48.930" style="s2">enough and we have there are several</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.930" end="00:48:52.050" style="s2">way because their cellular structure is</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.090" end="00:48:56.010" style="s2">not standard</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.050" end="00:48:58.020" style="s2">so skeletal muscle being multinucleate</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.080" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">without adding cells therefore it not</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.500" end="00:49:26.430" style="s2">exactly what I answered this person over</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.650" end="00:49:28.380" style="s2">email was that the brain is also similar</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.430" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">in the sense that exercising the brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.380" end="00:49:33.390" style="s2">is not a matter of cellular growth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">a matter of dendritic growth and so that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.390" end="00:49:40.850" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t predict degradation through</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:45.510" style="s2">use quite the opposite but you do see</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.850" end="00:49:47.700" style="s2">damage from from what the numbers are</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.510" end="00:49:48.810" style="s2">but something like going to you know 90%</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.700" end="00:49:51.810" style="s2">and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.810" end="00:49:53.490" style="s2">of what you&#39;re capable of doing both at</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.810" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">the muscular and cardiovascular levels I</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.490" end="00:49:57.780" style="s2">think actually puts you at least for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">short term at greater risk of getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.780" end="00:50:04.460" style="s2">any viruses or bacteria that you may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:06.840" style="s2">exposed to and probably also does cause</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.840" end="00:50:10.740" style="s2">damaged from that particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.610" end="00:50:12.570" style="s2">exercise so honest-to-goodness cellular</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.740" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">damage does have this effect some</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.570" end="00:50:16.620" style="s2">tissues involved don&#39;t regenerate very</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:18.930" style="s2">well so cartilage for example does not</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.620" end="00:50:22.050" style="s2">regenerate and you can give yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.930" end="00:50:24.630" style="s2">arthritis by for example running on hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.050" end="00:50:26.390" style="s2">surfaces this sort of thing so what I</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.630" end="00:50:30.080" style="s2">would say is it&#39;s a tissue by tissue</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.390" end="00:50:33.120" style="s2">analysis and then the final complexity</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.080" end="00:50:34.810" style="s2">is that exercise obviously does some</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.120" end="00:50:36.790" style="s2">things for you that actually reduce</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.810" end="00:50:39.340" style="s2">where even if the exercise itself causes</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.790" end="00:50:40.930" style="s2">wear if it brings your weight down then</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.340" end="00:50:44.200" style="s2">the amount of wear and tear you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.930" end="00:50:45.940" style="s2">for you step is less so it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.200" end="00:50:47.260" style="s2">phenomenon and what you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.940" end="00:50:50.050" style="s2">figure out what the net of all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.260" end="00:50:52.390" style="s2">things are and also figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.050" end="00:50:56.200" style="s2">play the game right so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.390" end="00:50:58.120" style="s2">that you know for example biking has the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.200" end="00:50:59.470" style="s2">cardiovascular benefits of running but</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.120" end="00:51:02.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t do the damage to your joints</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.470" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">it may be something worth considering</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.320" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really even more so right</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.099" end="00:51:10.999" style="s2">hi math major here after you prove a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.349" end="00:51:13.009" style="s2">conjecture it becomes a theorem without</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.999" end="00:51:15.109" style="s2">an axiom axiom is something you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.009" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">prove and assume correct foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.109" end="00:51:20.029" style="s2">mass otherwise absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:22.549" style="s2">analogy love from Russia PS allowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.029" end="00:51:24.410" style="s2">open discussion certainly wins yep I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.549" end="00:51:26.930" style="s2">love this now there is some ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.410" end="00:51:28.819" style="s2">because I mean basically these things</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.930" end="00:51:31.220" style="s2">don&#39;t map perfect this is a reference to</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.819" end="00:51:33.380" style="s2">our episode 1516 it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.220" end="00:51:35.989" style="s2">right and so the I think the point that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.380" end="00:51:39.109" style="s2">this this person is making is that an</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.989" end="00:51:43.009" style="s2">axiom is presumed true which is also the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.109" end="00:51:45.049" style="s2">case for a theory right presumed true in</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.009" end="00:51:47.329" style="s2">the case of axiom the part that I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.049" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">I got wrong is that an axiom could turn</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.329" end="00:51:53.269" style="s2">out to be false right and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:56.690" style="s2">several people did point out this nuance</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.269" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">the upshot wasn&#39;t entirely clear but</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.690" end="00:52:00.349" style="s2">let&#39;s just say the mapping is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:01.729" style="s2">perfect I think I suggested that it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.349" end="00:52:04.249" style="s2">closer than it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.729" end="00:52:05.690" style="s2">but nonetheless the parallel is there</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.249" end="00:52:09.769" style="s2">the question is really one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.690" end="00:52:12.499" style="s2">terminology and anyway I have to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.769" end="00:52:15.069" style="s2">pretty excited that a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.499" end="00:52:17.569" style="s2">people seem to have taken the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.069" end="00:52:18.789" style="s2">question of these terms and their</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.239" end="00:52:29.029" style="s2">that was the point and let&#39;s keep</p>

<p begin="00:53:38.730" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">true so you know how would you do it why</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.400" end="00:53:46.500" style="s2">would you do it but but anyway I called</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:49.320" style="s2">it wrong so anyway I do hope that Joe&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.320" end="00:53:57.900" style="s2">on it eliminates the sensorial bias but</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.010" end="00:53:59.799" style="s2">who knows if that was part of his</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.900" end="00:54:02.450" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.799" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">can wearing masks prevent the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.450" end="00:54:08.170" style="s2">strains that have mild or no symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.680" end="00:54:11.140" style="s2">this is an excellent question and I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.170" end="00:54:14.380" style="s2">and I have wondered it you know given</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.140" end="00:54:16.359" style="s2">that people who are let&#39;s just make it</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.380" end="00:54:21.730" style="s2">clean and say who are asymptomatic are</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.359" end="00:54:24.970" style="s2">not coughing air droplets of people at</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.730" end="00:54:27.369" style="s2">the very least they need to be in closer</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.970" end="00:54:30.009" style="s2">proximity probably for longer because</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.369" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">speaking is going to eject fewer than</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.009" end="00:54:35.950" style="s2">coughing or sneezing well that said you</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:37.960" style="s2">know something like like singing or</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.950" end="00:54:39.789" style="s2">yelling will produce a lot of air</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.960" end="00:54:41.769" style="s2">droplets and people do you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.789" end="00:54:43.930" style="s2">us sometimes find myself talking like</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.769" end="00:54:45.430" style="s2">and can we watch something come out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.930" end="00:54:50.200" style="s2">her mouth much to our embarrassment</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.430" end="00:54:53.740" style="s2">right so yes but will they will masks</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.200" end="00:54:55.240" style="s2">prevent as many infections in in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.740" end="00:54:56.529" style="s2">person who is asymptomatic who was</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.240" end="00:54:58.900" style="s2">wearing them as opposed to a person who</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.529" end="00:55:01.509" style="s2">is symptomatic was wearing them probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.900" end="00:55:03.999" style="s2">not but certainly will prevent more it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.509" end="00:55:06.190" style="s2">will prevent more infections than not</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.999" end="00:55:10.809" style="s2">wearing it at all yeah I guess I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.190" end="00:55:14.440" style="s2">really sure why one would expect it not</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.809" end="00:55:17.799" style="s2">to work I mean the fact is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.440" end="00:55:20.349" style="s2">about maybe I just can&#39;t read it can can</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.799" end="00:55:22.150" style="s2">wearing masks prevent well yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.349" end="00:55:25.989" style="s2">you could read it that way I read it as</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.150" end="00:55:27.849" style="s2">as you know will they do they stand some</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.989" end="00:55:32.170" style="s2">chance of being effective and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.849" end="00:55:35.109" style="s2">given that earliest the main symptom</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.170" end="00:55:36.910" style="s2">that people talk about in sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.109" end="00:55:38.109" style="s2">classic go but nineteen if there can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.910" end="00:55:39.819" style="s2">such a thing for a disease that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.109" end="00:55:42.309" style="s2">around for less than a year is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.819" end="00:55:44.650" style="s2">extreme and unending coughing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.309" end="00:55:47.589" style="s2">coughing is going to just spray droplets</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.650" end="00:55:49.420" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t have symptoms you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.589" end="00:55:53.980" style="s2">going to be spraying droplets at speed</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.420" end="00:55:56.200" style="s2">less so then right but the point is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.980" end="00:55:58.150" style="s2">mask takes care of some large fraction</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.200" end="00:55:59.680" style="s2">of droplets so to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.150" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">asymptomatic people are spreading the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.680" end="00:56:05.009" style="s2">disease to people who haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:07.749" style="s2">exposed yet it seems to me like the mask</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.009" end="00:56:11.140" style="s2">has the same positive effect it will</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.749" end="00:56:15.009" style="s2">still filter out some fraction of those</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.140" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">particles and result in the exposure</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.009" end="00:56:17.820" style="s2">being that much less intense and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:20.040" style="s2">therefore that much</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.820" end="00:56:21.960" style="s2">less likely to cause infection so if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.040" end="00:56:27.210" style="s2">can try to translate this I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.960" end="00:56:28.980" style="s2">saying that say I&#39;m just gonna put fake</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.210" end="00:56:31.530" style="s2">numbers on this say someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.980" end="00:56:33.990" style="s2">actively coughing and is not wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.530" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">mask would infect 10 people and by</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.990" end="00:56:37.140" style="s2">wearing a mask they can produce let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:39.480" style="s2">make it easier can infect a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.140" end="00:56:43.380" style="s2">people and by by wearing a mask we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.480" end="00:56:45.390" style="s2">reduce that to 10 and and thus it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.380" end="00:56:47.670" style="s2">reduction of 90% of the infection</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.390" end="00:56:49.320" style="s2">a person who is asymptomatic but has the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.670" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">virus might only infect 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.320" end="00:56:53.070" style="s2">because they&#39;re not spreading as much</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:54.990" style="s2">and wearing a mask what is expected to</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.070" end="00:56:56.970" style="s2">have exactly the same fractional effect</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.990" end="00:56:58.380" style="s2">so in that case the person who would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.970" end="00:57:00.270" style="s2">infecting 10 people is now only</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.380" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">infecting one and the person who would</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.270" end="00:57:05.790" style="s2">be infecting 10 people is only affecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:10.770" style="s2">10 but there still is just as much gain</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.790" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">in in cain&#39;t and loss there&#39;s just as</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.770" end="00:57:17.100" style="s2">much decrease in infection transmission</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:19.460" style="s2">but you just start out at probably very</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.100" end="00:57:21.600" style="s2">different places yes all of that assumes</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.460" end="00:57:23.250" style="s2">droplet size is the same for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.600" end="00:57:25.320" style="s2">symptomatic in the asymptomatic the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.250" end="00:57:26.850" style="s2">droplet numbers right but so yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.320" end="00:57:29.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know that there&#39;s an all else</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.850" end="00:57:33.450" style="s2">being equal assumption there that may</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.160" end="00:57:35.190" style="s2">well not be true yeah yeah okay how much</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.450" end="00:57:36.600" style="s2">do you trust the bioinformatics people</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.190" end="00:57:39.300" style="s2">in regards to figuring out what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.600" end="00:57:42.870" style="s2">scope two strains there are do you trust</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.300" end="00:57:45.540" style="s2">my Python or our program so so should we</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.870" end="00:57:48.590" style="s2">trust the implicit models both a general</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.540" end="00:57:48.590" style="s2">and a particular question</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.780" end="00:57:54.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s this one here</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.370" end="00:58:01.740" style="s2">certainly I don&#39;t trust the attitude</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.960" end="00:58:03.840" style="s2">that my Python or our program says so in</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.740" end="00:58:05.220" style="s2">fact this is this is a big beef that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.840" end="00:58:08.040" style="s2">have with a lot of the way that modern</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.220" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">that the analysis part of modern science</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.040" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">is done that even very careful</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:16.770" style="s2">scientists who are hypothesis driven and</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:19.530" style="s2">went to great lengths to do exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.770" end="00:58:21.690" style="s2">right experiment in order to address to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.530" end="00:58:24.660" style="s2">distinguish prophesies and collected</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.690" end="00:58:27.450" style="s2">data very carefully in in a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.660" end="00:58:30.060" style="s2">controlled way are often very willing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.450" end="00:58:33.060" style="s2">throw those data into some effectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.060" end="00:58:36.300" style="s2">big complex black box of a statistical</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.060" end="00:58:37.860" style="s2">analysis program and have something pop</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.300" end="00:58:39.960" style="s2">out the other side I&#39;m going to pop what</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.860" end="00:58:42.540" style="s2">pops out is something I like they go oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.960" end="00:58:45.300" style="s2">yeah this is wonderful and maybe don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.540" end="00:58:47.310" style="s2">question whether or not they met the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.300" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">assumptions of the test whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.310" end="00:58:51.750" style="s2">they slid something wrong it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:54.420" style="s2">long time since I&#39;ve used are at this</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.750" end="00:58:58.020" style="s2">point and I was never very very good</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.420" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">with it but it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.020" end="00:59:02.760" style="s2">program as all you know as Sasa&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:06.060" style="s2">spss is like as all of the stats</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.760" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">programs are and you can do too much</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.060" end="00:59:11.610" style="s2">without really knowing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:12.630" style="s2">and they let you they let you break the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.610" end="00:59:14.910" style="s2">assumptions of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.630" end="00:59:15.930" style="s2">statistical tests so this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.910" end="00:59:18.630" style="s2">slightly different question since</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.930" end="00:59:20.760" style="s2">bioinformatics and but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.630" end="00:59:25.160" style="s2">question about how many strains there</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.760" end="00:59:27.180" style="s2">are and so I don&#39;t know and just as to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.160" end="00:59:29.100" style="s2">deciding whether some creature is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.180" end="00:59:31.890" style="s2">member of a different species or the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.100" end="00:59:33.990" style="s2">same species is something in which we</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.890" end="00:59:36.570" style="s2">just have a standard there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.990" end="00:59:39.300" style="s2">going to be a standard for strain</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.570" end="00:59:41.130" style="s2">there&#39;s the caveat that we have said</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.300" end="00:59:43.590" style="s2">several times which is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.130" end="00:59:45.150" style="s2">certain to be a huge number of strains</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.590" end="00:59:48.210" style="s2">that are never detected because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.150" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">so quickly dead ended and so when we say</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.210" end="00:59:51.420" style="s2">is there another strain what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:55.380" style="s2">really saying is have some strains</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.420" end="00:59:57.210" style="s2">succeeded enough that we see it so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.380" end="00:59:58.590" style="s2">don&#39;t even think the question you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.210" end="01:00:00.210" style="s2">not your question but I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.590" end="01:00:01.380" style="s2">question how many strains are there is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.210" end="01:00:03.390" style="s2">good question I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.380" end="01:00:05.550" style="s2">answerable questions how many strains</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.390" end="01:00:06.780" style="s2">are successful enough that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.550" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">worry about in this distinct</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.780" end="01:00:09.550" style="s2">evolutionary phenomena that might be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:14.610" style="s2">good question</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.550" end="01:00:18.040" style="s2">and do I trust I mean the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.610" end="01:00:21.160" style="s2">phylogenetically speaking which is the</p>

<p begin="01:01:34.450" end="01:01:37.360" style="s2">you know other creatures do this too</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.920" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">there are certainly ways that you can</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.060" end="01:01:52.890" style="s2">right but anyway the point is</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.670" end="01:01:54.300" style="s2">painting with a broad brush the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.890" end="01:01:55.980" style="s2">assumptions about phylogenetic</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.300" end="01:01:57.630" style="s2">systematics and the model that it uses</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.980" end="01:01:59.460" style="s2">is so dead simple there&#39;s almost nothing</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.630" end="01:02:02.010" style="s2">that can be wrong with it other than</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.460" end="01:02:03.210" style="s2">some pattern that doesn&#39;t fit you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.010" end="01:02:04.650" style="s2">if you have two branches of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.210" end="01:02:05.640" style="s2">evolutionary tree that then come back</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.650" end="01:02:07.470" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.640" end="01:02:10.620" style="s2">then that&#39;s not going to be mapped on to</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.470" end="01:02:13.500" style="s2">a program that assumes bifurcation right</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.620" end="01:02:14.670" style="s2">so that sort of thing can up end it but</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.500" end="01:02:16.530" style="s2">in general if we&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.670" end="01:02:18.630" style="s2">how many strains of the virus there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.530" end="01:02:21.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not a complex question and so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.630" end="01:02:22.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have a highly complex mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.090" end="01:02:25.140" style="s2">model that can offend you you have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.860" end="01:02:27.450" style="s2">very simple mathematical model and what</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.140" end="01:02:29.610" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is shoving lots of data at</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.450" end="01:02:31.560" style="s2">it and the more data you have the more</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.610" end="01:02:35.400" style="s2">it drowns out the noise and the better</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.560" end="01:02:38.730" style="s2">you can see so that&#39;s all pretty secure</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.400" end="01:02:41.250" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s to make a long story</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.730" end="01:02:43.260" style="s2">short I think there is a reason to trust</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.250" end="01:02:46.290" style="s2">some sort of broad brush analysis that</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.260" end="01:02:49.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get out over its keys about how</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.290" end="01:02:50.490" style="s2">many strains there are but how many</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.140" end="01:02:51.660" style="s2">strains there are doesn&#39;t mean how many</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.490" end="01:02:56.630" style="s2">strains there are it means how many</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.660" end="01:03:02.370" style="s2">strains are we seeing actively spreading</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.630" end="01:03:04.200" style="s2">over an hour okay um let&#39;s just at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.370" end="01:03:07.040" style="s2">let&#39;s get through two more and again</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.200" end="01:03:08.970" style="s2">we&#39;re missing so many which we apologize</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.040" end="01:03:10.680" style="s2">thank you again for treading water</p>

<p begin="01:04:14.720" end="01:04:19.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe that&#39;s something he and</p>

<p begin="01:04:21.380" end="01:04:29.600" style="s2">trachtenberg er yep and that you know he</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.530" end="01:04:31.190" style="s2">I haven&#39;t listened to all of them but I</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.600" end="01:04:32.960" style="s2">think I&#39;m more familiar with Daniels</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.190" end="01:04:36.710" style="s2">position than I am with Erik&#39;s objection</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.960" end="01:04:39.260" style="s2">to it and Erik basically starts by</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.710" end="01:04:42.290" style="s2">saying you know calling me suspicious or</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.260" end="01:04:44.600" style="s2">not suspicious color me skeptical but</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.530" end="01:04:51.500" style="s2">I mean look there are several questions</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.120" end="01:04:54.520" style="s2">tied up here and we don&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.500" end="01:04:58.580" style="s2">go into all of them one is is there a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.520" end="01:05:00.470" style="s2">system that could be reached if we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.580" end="01:05:02.120" style="s2">teleport rather than figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.470" end="01:05:03.620" style="s2">get there is there a system that would</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.120" end="01:05:06.740" style="s2">be stable and have the characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.620" end="01:05:08.030" style="s2">that we would agree a game B solution</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.740" end="01:05:09.800" style="s2">would have to have in order to be called</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.030" end="01:05:11.870" style="s2">that that&#39;s a different question than</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.800" end="01:05:13.640" style="s2">can we get there from here which might</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.870" end="01:05:16.130" style="s2">be impossible even if the place to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.640" end="01:05:18.410" style="s2">actually does exist and so which of</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.130" end="01:05:21.020" style="s2">these things Erik is skeptical about my</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.410" end="01:05:23.330" style="s2">guess would be that you know if he says</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.020" end="01:05:25.460" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t trust that people can get</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.330" end="01:05:27.470" style="s2">there that&#39;s a navigation question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.460" end="01:05:29.720" style="s2">not a is there an evolutionarily stable</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.470" end="01:05:33.320" style="s2">strategy that would accomplish the goal</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.720" end="01:05:35.930" style="s2">so I am also skeptical that that we will</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.320" end="01:05:37.730" style="s2">get there I think it&#39;s plausible I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.930" end="01:05:39.260" style="s2">it&#39;s worth pursuing until we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.730" end="01:05:40.460" style="s2">impossible because otherwise I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.260" end="01:05:42.590" style="s2">know what we&#39;re gonna do and Erik&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:05:42.590" end="01:05:52.790" style="s2">is frankly not very helpful could I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.320" end="01:05:54.800" style="s2">not sure I know what this next question</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.790" end="01:05:56.690" style="s2">is we may go to another one but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.800" end="01:05:58.820" style="s2">read it could the missing mechanisms be</p>

<p begin="01:05:58.820" end="01:06:04.550" style="s2">come together to form a new organism</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.800" end="01:06:06.830" style="s2">with a new unique ability that could be</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.550" end="01:06:10.790" style="s2">one element we&#39;ve talked before about</p>

<p begin="01:06:20.780" end="01:06:30.920" style="s2">other but there will be many mechanisms</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.950" end="01:07:15.410" style="s2">obligate twin bearing and they also have</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.150" end="01:07:17.300" style="s2">offspring that require a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.410" end="01:07:19.970" style="s2">amount of care and they have a difficult</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.300" end="01:07:21.590" style="s2">nature tiny and their offspring are big</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.970" end="01:07:23.930" style="s2">proportion of their body size so mom is</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.590" end="01:07:25.940" style="s2">a hard time carrying them as vera boreal</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.930" end="01:07:27.800" style="s2">and all this so anyway they&#39;re one of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.940" end="01:07:30.830" style="s2">few species in which we see something</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.800" end="01:07:34.760" style="s2">like polyandry which is multiple males</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.830" end="01:07:36.350" style="s2">and anyway for a long time I thought it</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.760" end="01:07:37.640" style="s2">must be that they were identical twins</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.350" end="01:07:40.100" style="s2">which would solve the question of why</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.640" end="01:07:41.930" style="s2">the male&#39;s put up with the two male</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.100" end="01:07:44.120" style="s2">mates of the mother that the three of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.930" end="01:07:45.830" style="s2">them going around co-parenting that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.120" end="01:07:48.260" style="s2">two fathers were identical twins as well</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.830" end="01:07:49.910" style="s2">right which I you know in I almost</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.260" end="01:07:52.160" style="s2">failed out of graduate school on this</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.910" end="01:07:54.800" style="s2">basis because I knew they were behaving</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.160" end="01:07:56.120" style="s2">like identical twins and yet the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.800" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">evidence said that they were not</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.120" end="01:08:00.650" style="s2">identical twins and that just didn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.450" style="s2">so I basically kept making that point</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.650" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">that they really have to be identical</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.450" end="01:08:05.330" style="s2">twins and the professor is all of whom</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:07.190" style="s2">in this case were actually really</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.330" end="01:08:08.090" style="s2">excellent just kept saying to you yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.190" end="01:08:09.860" style="s2">but it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.090" end="01:08:11.990" style="s2">right but is it true no it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.860" end="01:08:15.440" style="s2">okay but anyway it turned out years</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.990" end="01:08:16.970" style="s2">later that chimerism solves the problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.440" end="01:08:18.800" style="s2">that I thought that identical twins</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.970" end="01:08:21.440" style="s2">would solve in a way that I didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.800" end="01:08:24.740" style="s2">to predict because basically in the womb</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.440" end="01:08:27.230" style="s2">males exchange tissue and so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.740" end="01:08:29.270" style="s2">brothers who are not one individual or</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.230" end="01:08:31.250" style="s2">another each brother is a composite of</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.270" end="01:08:35.540" style="s2">the same two genomes and therefore when</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.250" end="01:08:37.370" style="s2">one brother reproduces they are passing</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.540" end="01:08:39.260" style="s2">on the genes that they both carry so</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.370" end="01:08:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s really actually be that if if</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.260" end="01:08:44.720" style="s2">brother a has sex with their shared mate</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.320" end="01:08:47.300" style="s2">it may actually be brother B is genome</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.720" end="01:08:49.520" style="s2">that he spreads through his sperm and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.300" end="01:08:51.320" style="s2">read I&#39;m realizing in this moment saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.520" end="01:08:54.540" style="s2">there is no brother a and brother B</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.320" end="01:08:59.310" style="s2">they&#39;re both a and B asleep</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.540" end="01:08:59.310" style="s2">individual yes something like identical</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.810" end="01:09:05.830" style="s2">right but I mean there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.390" end="01:09:07.420" style="s2">individuals right I mean there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.830" end="01:09:09.130" style="s2">individuals that you can look at and yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.420" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">genetically they are not genomically</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.130" end="01:09:12.700" style="s2">individuals right but they mean you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:14.259" style="s2">you can look at them and say okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.700" end="01:09:15.609" style="s2">you know that&#39;s Steve over there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.259" end="01:09:19.450" style="s2">you could put collar on one of them and</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.609" end="01:09:21.730" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something even if even if</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.450" end="01:09:24.250" style="s2">this guy wandered off for two weeks</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.730" end="01:09:25.960" style="s2">during her fertile period and this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.250" end="01:09:27.910" style="s2">the only one having sex with their mate</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.960" end="01:09:29.980" style="s2">that the guy who had wandered off may</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.910" end="01:09:31.330" style="s2">actually turn out to be genetically the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.980" end="01:09:33.190" style="s2">father of the resulting offspring</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.330" end="01:09:35.290" style="s2">because of the Kaymer ISM well I still</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.190" end="01:09:37.390" style="s2">think you can&#39;t even say he may be the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.290" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">father because what is he and my point</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.390" end="01:09:46.509" style="s2">would be actually it&#39;s a very Clintonian</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:48.370" style="s2">thing you just said digging it okay I do</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.509" end="01:09:50.440" style="s2">want to just quickly one more question</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.470" end="01:09:58.360" style="s2">your comments patriarchy is a myth for</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.110" end="01:10:01.750" style="s2">example piques my interest I do not want</p>
