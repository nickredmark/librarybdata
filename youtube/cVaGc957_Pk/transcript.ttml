<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">you know from way back close to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">other in southampton we actually come</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">from the same city</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2">oh is that right is that right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">almost no one comes from there so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.600" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">really interesting oh really that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">when i i first spoke with david um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">one thing that attracted me to rebel</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">wisdom in general</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">was the fact that it was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">cultural issues and things going on of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">the moment but it was also</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">looking at it from frameworks that were</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">maybe slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">mystical or spiritual and these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">aren&#39;t there isn&#39;t much space for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:30.800" style="s2">necessarily i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">in the in the mainstream public</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.800" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">and the way that i&#39;ve come to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">conversation has never been political</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">um i&#39;ve come to this conversation um</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">maybe through something that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">could consider close to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">yeah something of a of a more spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">inclination</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">i recognize that you know there is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">much more to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">us to each other um</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">then we&#39;re often led to believe or we</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">often allow ourselves to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">um and i recognize that there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">certain ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">that can really</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">stop us from recognizing our commonality</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">and when i saw things deepening</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">in in that sense you know stopping this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">type of recognition that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what got me very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">this cultural shift</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">and this moment it wasn&#39;t for me or left</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">or right thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">it just seemed that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">that there could be another way to look</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">at some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">really contentious issues from a lens</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">solely political um and so when i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">speaking uh to david i was saying you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">know like</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">i&#39;m very interested in maybe trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">come across someone who</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">who is maybe thinking about these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">from from another maybe more humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">angle and then there you are in his bag</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">and i i did read the book and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">it was really uh you know because i had</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">no expectations you know when he</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">gave it to me i mean i&#39;m at the point at</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">the moment i get books given to me often</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">um and you know you don&#39;t always you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">kind of just half take it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">really know what to expect you know and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">kind of grateful and you&#39;re not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">you&#39;re going to read it</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">but you take it anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">but i did i was on the bus and and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know just thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">uh as often and and especially with</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">a new sort of increased platform i guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">i&#39;m very much thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:38.160" style="s2">how how best to serve</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">you know and i just thought that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.160" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">your book would have something in it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">it very much did</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">um and then i i did some more research</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">and you know i see you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">compassionate conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">and maybe one of the things that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">trying to learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">is how do we make people with</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">opposing views see that the other side</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t evil</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">you know but maybe just how do we show</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">people that others who they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">with just have different understandings</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">of what is good</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">rather than i&#39;m trying to deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">subjugate</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">and oppress you of course that happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">intentionally in some areas but i</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">personally don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what most people set out to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">and so i&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">you know like how do you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">some of the tools that you think for</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">having more compassionate conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">one of the things that comes up a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">conversation these days</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">you know i i think in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">wolf culture and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">you know basically the the effort to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">to genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">create equality which is the the upside</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">in my experience of what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">um this kind of you you said something i</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">thought was interesting you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">the difference between being woke</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">as though it&#39;s a done deal an awakening</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">which is an ongoing process so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">wave of awakening is that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">happen you know one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">we&#39;re asked to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s it&#39;s good for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">is just simply learn how to listen</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">learn how to listen to somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">experience that is different from our</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">that maybe they&#39;ve drawn different</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">conclusions and different beliefs based</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:22.030" style="s2">and to be able to do it in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">where we distinguish what we&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.030" end="00:06:26.479" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">from agreement we may agree we may not</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.479" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">we may have a different set as you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">saying with david that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">really different set of life experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">but our capacity to receive</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">and hear someone else&#39;s experience that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">that language of you know can i</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">understand i don&#39;t quite know what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">means can i hear and can i take in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">what someone else is telling me</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">absolutely i can&#39;t without a doubt so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">that quality that ability to really</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">listen and receive and not allow our own</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">reference points our own desires our own</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">needs to get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">i think is a fundamental skill that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">all need to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">so even just the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">listening to me right now i can feel the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">of your receptivity you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">taking in what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">you know so i think that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">fundamental because it&#39;s easy to listen</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">when i hear something i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to listen when i hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">something that i&#39;m at least open to but</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">it gets really difficult to listen</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">when i hear something that i don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">with and even harder to listen when i</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">myself feel criticized</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">or challenged or called out or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">you know that&#39;s one of the real skill</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">sets that we need to develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">as an inability to realize that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">listen in spite of being stressed</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">you know that&#39;s something we can do so i</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">would start there with just</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">that basic skill and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">why do you think that you know i i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">you&#39;re right i think listening</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">really is key of course and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">simple but</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think many of us do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">very well we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">we think we do but we actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">especially when we&#39;re stressed</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">exactly but i often think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:07.759" style="s2">disagree with that we probably need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">pay closer attention to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">yeah you know or probably that we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">to listen to more of i think and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s worked in my favor but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve always just been</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">very naturally interested in ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">i disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">um because i&#39;ve always been keen to know</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">well how does someone get to that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">know like because i guess if you truly</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">do maybe think an idea is harmful you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">rather than condemning that idea off the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">bat i mean which you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.959" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">can do but if you want to maybe stop the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">flow of those ideas then you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">able to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">like you know what drives people or</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">draws people into these types of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">um so yeah i&#39;ve always i i really think</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">that type of thing um yeah listening to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">or becoming more curious about</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">what we dislike i think is is quite key</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">yeah well i i think it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">you i&#39;ve observed both you and david do</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">well and it might be fun at some point</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">during the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">maybe we can find a way to disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">each other so we can model that i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">one of the things that we tend not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">see very much online is we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">healthy disa well maybe we do do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">guys feel like you see people</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">disagree and challenge each other online</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">you&#39;re right because when i was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">listening to you today</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">i remember you said something somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">and i think actually this might have</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">been around the metoo movement you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">speaking to someone about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">and i think somewhere you said something</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">like you like to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">um you like to encourage disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">absolutely to work with that and i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because i</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">would say you&#39;re right when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">podcasts and alternative media i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">often we&#39;re speaking to people who who</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">agree with us</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah we don&#39;t often have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">that space so i wouldn&#39;t i would say on</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">twitter i often find</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">that the way that i use twitter and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">been very grateful because i see that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen with many</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">people but sometimes people disagree</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">with me and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the most it&#39;s the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">disagreements i&#39;ve ever heard you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">like yeah you&#39;re just kind of more than</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">angry or aggressive they&#39;re just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">like oh you haven&#39;t considered this</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">do you remember this yeah and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">like oh well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">um i couldn&#39;t consider that i will next</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">so sometimes on twitter it happens uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">but generally speaking no i don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">very often</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">so that&#39;s something i think we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">actually start to model and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">talking with david a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">what would it be like to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">to have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">with people of really different world</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">views and see what we can learn about</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">doing it online</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">so the the curiosity that you&#39;re that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">such a driver of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">how you relate to the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">one has to have one has to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">questioner now how do you ask good</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">questions how do you know as you said</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">you like to actually you gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">opinions that aren&#39;t your own because</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in how people arrived</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.519" style="s2">at them so that very process of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">that process of questioning of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">i think is another one and again i will</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">you know the channel has done a great</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">job with working with polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">theory and working with embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">working with somatic responses</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">but lots of times what keeps us from</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">either listening or inquiring in a real</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">way is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">literally just the responsive threat in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">the nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">for you to be able to hear something you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">disagree with and be</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">curious is actually counter-intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">usually we move away from the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">right it&#39;s like almost like amoeba you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">know there&#39;s a stimulus and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">something that we don&#39;t like we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">simply move away</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">and so to turn and inquire into that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">counter-intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">you know so that that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">amazing thing to be able to do in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:53.000" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">well thank you and again it&#39;s from life</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.000" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">experiences that i&#39;ve had so far you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">you watched the interview with david and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">i you know i</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">i spoke about you know my brother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">passing and wanting to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">what happened you know essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">could drive a young man to take someone</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">else&#39;s life and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">and i think once you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">you know tragic things like that i guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">everything else if i&#39;m honest it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feel as threatening in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">comparison</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">uh you know so as much as that was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">really tragic situation like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:30.320" style="s2">i&#39;m grateful for the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:32.000" style="s2">how can i put it i&#39;m grateful for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.320" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">tolerance it&#39;s given me</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">in in a certain way um</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">yeah i i guess so um</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">it&#39;s also going to say to you um</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">and also what i found really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">in the book and which is something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">i never knew about before and i guess i</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">mentioned it to david in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">is you know you talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">stages of being maybe is maybe what i</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">can call it and i remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:04.839" style="s2">the ethnocentric stage the world-centric</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:08.079" style="s2">stage and things like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">um do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.079" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">how do we because maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">possible to um</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">help people sort of move through these</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">stages i&#39;m starting to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">it&#39;s something people can only do on</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">their own but so</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">for let&#39;s say like people like myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">who are quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">critical you know or concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">excesses</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">of the woke movement if you like</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been trying to tell myself for</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">some time now you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">when i&#39;m trying to not get too</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">frustrated and i&#39;m trying to and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">remember that i&#39;ve been in that place</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">in many ways you know how do we try to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">how can we remind people because i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:57.519" style="s2">in becoming so anti the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:14:01.920" style="s2">don&#39;t like that you are also now</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.519" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">that thing and so how do we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.920" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">because what i don&#39;t see i think enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">of sometimes is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t often see people trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">their world view enough because what i</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">see there and i think it&#39;s overlooked a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">lot is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">a lot of pain you know anger yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">anger is a anger is a more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">socially acceptable presentation of pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">you know but i think it&#39;s pain and hurt</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">that&#39;s really there</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">um and which is why i try not to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">demeaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">of them i may be critical but not</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">demeaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">i hear that yeah i hear that um</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">so there are kind of three different</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">things going on for me and what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying right now so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">first one is just back to that original</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">that you posed at the beginning around</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">state stages structure stages of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">and what does that have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">everything so a little something on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">and then the other two things i heard</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">is that people that how humans develop</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">and grow is a bit of a mystery you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">starting to think people can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">coerced they actually it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">almost that you elect into and i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">you&#39;re right about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">and then the question of how is pain</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">and maybe we can use the word trauma</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">because that&#39;s you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">working with trauma these days</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">how can trauma be related with</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">in a way that we become liberated and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">free to love rather than</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">now oriented around how traumatized we</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">are because that&#39;s the other danger of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">trauma right is that then</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">it becomes the identity so you know how</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">do we actually work with that so just in</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">terms of state stages</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">i found stages of development really</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">helpful to me in my mediation work</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">and as i said in my book i went from i</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">just naturally started using elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">kubler ross&#39;s stages of grief because i</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">was doing work at the time</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">a lot of conversations related to race i</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">was working in the judiciary and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">we had a racial and ethnic fairness task</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">force and this was 20 years ago i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">believe how long it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">and i just saw such a range of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">availability</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">and the way people showed up in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">from denial all the way to absolute flex</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">flexible warm-hearted freedom</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">availability creativity that i was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t help but start to create</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">you know of people right regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">race or ethnicity people who were</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">you know in denial that there were any</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">issues people who were angry and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">advocating at the top of their lungs</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">fair enough people who&#39;d kind of found a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">niche that worked for them</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">bargaining people who were just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">want to relate and were</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">sad and then these as i said before just</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">these people who were immensely free and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">i got very curious that&#39;s when i was</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">introduced to ken&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">so one of the things that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">important is how identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">is held in the body mind has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">what we&#39;re able to experience and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:58.000" style="s2">we&#39;re able to convey and communicate</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">with so when i hear you talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.000" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">what i hear you say is i can pick up an</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">but i am very in touch with that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">myself that&#39;s beyond identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not limited to the fact that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">black i&#39;m not limited to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">i&#39;m a woman i&#39;m not limited to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">my sexual identity or my gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">fluid and sometimes people do relate to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">as a privilege there&#39;s a privilege to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">free of identity and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">and you know there may be some truth in</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">that but what i say in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">compassionate conversations that i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">is important is it&#39;s a privilege i want</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:35.039" style="s2">everyone to be able to experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a privilege we want to share to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.039" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">free of identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">and i think we can and sorry that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">really i&#39;m glad you brought that up and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">you know it was just a few weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been thinking about identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">in my own personal journey i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">how much i promote it</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">maybe subtly i&#39;m sure it can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">creep into my ideas</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">um but i&#39;m very interested in this idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">of transcending identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s very interesting that you point</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">out from speaking to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">that you know or you can clearly feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">i&#39;m not someone who i try not to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">someone bound by my race</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">you know gender sexuality or anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">you said it those are the least</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">interesting parts of yourself i thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">that was a really interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">say and it made me think like</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">maybe those are the least interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">parts of myself i haven&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">it so i feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">i love that you said that well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">well i&#39;d like to i&#39;d like to think so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">i&#39;d like to think that those</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">and and i think maybe one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">why i take</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">a lot of the time that we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">now to heart is that many people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">intent on telling me that actually the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">most interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">is being black um and i think i find</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">that very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">and i think because if we&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">people the most interesting things about</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">them are their identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">um then they will never know what can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">beyond that and there is something about</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">identity that i do find quite limiting</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">um and i&#39;m saying it probably just on</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">twitter the other day that i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">the fixation with our identities can</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">limit our identities yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s say i&#39;m a black you know woman</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">and so maybe that means that i can only</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">listen to or read other black women and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">anything that isn&#39;t that i&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">naturally hostile about or</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">considered to be a threat you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">just limiting my own world view</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">um or you know my ability limiting my</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">my own capacity to connect with people</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">but the problem is like identity right</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">is is so um</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">big you know it&#39;s so important for</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">you know i i&#39;m but i feel a real freedom</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">you know and i can&#39;t necessarily i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">saying my life is perfect and that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t know buy your way into a ferrari</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">but what i am saying is that like</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">i i feel a sense of freedom you know i</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">feel a great sense of freedom in being</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">able to use my my short time here</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">and i&#39;m very hyper aware of that to um</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">that&#39;s something you and i have in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">interesting yes i did read that in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">book i remember i</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">i smiled to myself and i felt comforted</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">because i think you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">your sister</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">and you were talking about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:11.679" style="s2">differences between you and your sister</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">and you were the type of child who was</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.679" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">contemplating the meaning of life right</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">that was definitely me um my sister was</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">crushing it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">you know yeah right right and so yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">that&#39;s completely completely new</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">she still is oh no i i care</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">um so yeah you know how how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">we kind of go about you know because i</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">in order to transcend identity people</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">want to know what&#39;s left you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">not my identity if it&#39;s not my blackness</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">or my manhood or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">you know my femininity then then what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">for me and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">can i ask you a question about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">because one of the things that i found</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">really interesting is when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">about your the i i loved that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m thinking about those of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">who are listening right now you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">one of the things that we do know in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">developmental theory is that lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">times there&#39;s a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">when people will shift identity or shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">stages or be able to take on more world</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">views or or more perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">something like like they come to an</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">or a loss but when you describe that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">lying on the bed and seeing a slideshow</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">of all your most fundamental questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">that were extremely raw</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">and very intimate and in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">what i heard you say is</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">you they couldn&#39;t be avoided and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">the answers were so</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">in in some ways like um what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">what would the word be you said raw that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">you were so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">intimate with yourself and there was</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">sort of no getting out of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">in a way and and to me i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">what gave you access to this part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">that isn&#39;t limited by your respective</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">identities</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">and was it related to that crisis how</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">did you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">how how did you get in touch with this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">part of yourself and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">as being beyond identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">um is it is that a good is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">it is a question such a good question i</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">probably may not have thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">so i so like i said for me</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">it was um you know the catalyst was you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">know a close death in the family</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">um and it was you know the first time</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">i&#39;d ever experienced something like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">and immediately i could tell by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">that people responded in my family</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t actually have much</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">belief you know i</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:35.200" style="s2">they did have beliefs my family are</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">muslims um</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.200" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">however you know this sounds weird to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">say and i don&#39;t mean any disrespect to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">them or and of course definitely not to</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">the faith</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">but what it seemed as though is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">they were clinging on to religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">almost kind of as an insurance policy as</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">a kind of like you know just in case you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">know i&#39;m gonna hold on to this but</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">i could see they couldn&#39;t always lean on</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">for for warmth and and and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">protection when they most needed it</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">and so that made me think well what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">that thing you know because people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">gonna i&#39;m gonna keep losing people</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">you know people even closer potentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">so what am i gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">um and i guess that kick started this um</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">this search for something and at first</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">that was for maybe a tribe maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.840" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">maybe a truth or maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">akin to that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">i think when i realized how</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">when i realized that you know so from</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">this sort of awakening that i had</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">i realized how much of myself i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">cut myself off from because it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">fit the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">of maybe what a black girl does what a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">woman does what a woman is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">what a black person on the left is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">supposed to think or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">um just all of these things became very</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">very suffocating they were very</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:10.799" style="s2">suffocating all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">um and i recognized i&#39;d always had the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">ability to connect with anyone of any</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">race gender you know background social</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">hard for me to explain um but it&#39;s sorry</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really good to think about and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">really trying to give like um</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">a real answer but i just i just looked</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">around me and i saw that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">it seemed to me that people cling to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">because they were scared of this other</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">thing this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">that isn&#39;t always so pretty sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit dark sometimes a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">bit messy and it definitely isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">image of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">yourself that you like to portray</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">but once i realize that that thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make you bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">yes yeah yeah yeah once i realized that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">acknowledging these um</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">undesirable aspects of yourself that do</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">not make you bad once i took good and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">out of my vocabulary almost at least in</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">the way that i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">um i think that made it very easy</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">to explore anything that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">saying is</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">so important right now because i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the piece that when people do</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">diversity work</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">that they don&#39;t do well at all which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna substantiate a difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna substantiate a difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">based on our race based on our gender</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">based on whatever religion whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">we have to unpack how quickly we assign</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">good and bad to those differences</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s there immediately so if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">don&#39;t help people</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">unpack and let go of those value</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">judgments</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re just creating difference and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">binding people to these up and down</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">relationships so what i hear you saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">is that that there was some way in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">your encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">your life yourself including</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">the things that you were trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">the ways you were trying to be but also</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">maybe we would call those things shadow</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">that the part of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">that we feel like we can&#39;t show to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">world because they&#39;re too shameful</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">and that when you when you un</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">coupled those ex that part of who you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">are from this value judgment of good and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:21.039" style="s2">that was where freedom was for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">that&#39;s incredible yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.039" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">and you know so now i tried i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">good and bad i only tried to think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">things in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">um constructive and and destructive yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">i try not to you know so and and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">for me and so that only tells me if</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:40.240" style="s2">is productive or construct you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">productive or useful or not</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.240" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t about something being uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">morally you know incorrect and things</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">and so yeah it just yeah i really think</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">it you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">it truly does give us a sense of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">within ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">but also when i acknowledged some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">things that make me ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">of myself you know and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">things that were living in me</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">were unspeakable some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">and then recognizing that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">because i&#39;m not that unique</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">you know we&#39;re all living with our own</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t have a lot of guidance it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound like you had guidance</p>
