We focus on the idea of ​​happiness a lot
 The problem with this is that it takes our focus away from potentially more effective goals
 It is better to seek meaning than happiness
 12 Laws of Life About How to Live Right with Face
 Subjugation, tragedy and malice
 And one of the suggestions
 In 12 Laws of Life
 That the existence of life
 Use it to classify it as an interaction between chaos and order, or the unknown and the known
 You are always trying to balance these two things
 If what you do is too familiar, then you are bored
 Everything you do is so anonymous, you are anxious
 And what you have to do is find a neutral line between these two
 This broadens the meaning
 If you can get these two things right then you will have your cake and eat it too
 I hope people get the idea that there is a formula for existence
 In the face of ill and conquering life
 Noble and powerful
 He is able to keep them at the worst possible times without making them disruptive or angry
 12 Laws of Life, an antidote to chaos
