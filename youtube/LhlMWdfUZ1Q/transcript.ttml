<p begin="00:00:03.240" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">can how about me can you hear me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.730" end="00:00:11.040" style="s2">you&#39;re very clear I&#39;m outside so if the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">noise of the end of the ocean gets too</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:15.269" style="s2">noisy just let me go I can head inside</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">ha ha ha sounds like a rough environment</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.269" end="00:00:22.490" style="s2">right yeah how are you doing I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:27.480" style="s2">wonderfully to be perfectly honest I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.490" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">rereading your billion articles much as</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.480" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">it is a book but um yeah it&#39;s great it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:35.070" style="s2">fantastic to encounter it now just</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:37.430" style="s2">thinking about all the different folks I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.070" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">had offended too and you&#39;re ready we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.430" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">really yeah I would very much appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">that I have been you know speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">the the ambiguity that you just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">alluded to with respect to the article</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">versus book context I&#39;ve been wondering</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">in terms of you know how how best to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">publish it right like would it be better</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">split up into multiple articles or as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">long-form one I would I would I would I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">would in a virtual form I would break it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">up into probably four different articles</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">my sense is maybe five maybe three but</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a board seems like feels right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">medium of course has that structurally</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">is really they design it so it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">do it that way yep</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">and I&#39;ve noticed they even like it at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">stylistic level you&#39;ve almost already</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">coated that in where each section</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">recapitulates things in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">allows somebody to break off come back a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:30.509" style="s2">couple of days later and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">refresh and then separately I&#39;m glad you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">got that feeling because I was hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">do that given the the relative</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">complexity of the article I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">kind of create a continuity amongst</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">those ideas I think it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">things where you kind of have to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">something like that so I&#39;m glad it came</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">through yeah absolutely I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">actually myself from something I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">writing recently that you do you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">for as the writer the concepts are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:55.490" style="s2">clear so it may feel a bit from my</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">perspective it feels maybe a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.490" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">repetitive move on I think for the for</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">the reader it&#39;s extremely useful to kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:10.619" style="s2">of have like almost like an ABC a EF a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">be some kind of structure like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.619" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">where you&#39;re laying something out and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:16.410" style="s2">then you&#39;re coming back</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">returning to it in the new context that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.410" end="00:02:20.250" style="s2">the reader is now built in their</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">consciousness Dibble more it it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:24.709" style="s2">guess it would be structurally identical</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">to the evolutionary laying down of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.709" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">complex ecosystems yeah I think it has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:32.550" style="s2">lot to do with the idea of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.630" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">building those coherent structures to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.550" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">some extent not to get too mad and loop</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">back on the concepts in the essay itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:42.570" style="s2">but at least that&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">noticed developing as just a human being</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.570" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">in this world trying to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">other human beings and realizing over</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">time just how complex that can be when</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to communicate ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:02:56.070" style="s2">you think make complete sense in your</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">own mind given all of the late knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.070" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">and structure that you&#39;ve carried with</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">you implicitly and yet does not</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">necessarily exist in the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:09.080" style="s2">of other minds or may exist but in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:11.400" style="s2">other form of translated or rotated or</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.080" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">projected shapes that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.400" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">discover and kind of pull out somehow by</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">the way I just were interrupts that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:24.299" style="s2">great metaphor like the the topological</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">language um if somebody catches that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.299" end="00:03:29.720" style="s2">metaphor you&#39;re gonna be grabbing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.610" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">of territory precisely in doing map</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.720" end="00:03:35.420" style="s2">mapping yeah yeah yeah I I have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">language of projection and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.420" end="00:03:38.910" style="s2">transformation and so we&#39;ve given the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">fact that I had that that language we</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.910" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">can now you begin using that which is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:44.160" style="s2">very powerful language for doing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">kind of exercise extremely powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:49.320" style="s2">then that&#39;s why when I heard you speak I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2">think so we met for the first time at</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">the what is the upgrading democracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.500" end="00:03:57.329" style="s2">conference about a year ago okay and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">mean when you were speaking that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.329" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">also when I first met Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:01.620" style="s2">for the first time because he was there</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:03.269" style="s2">that day as well yeah that was before</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.620" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">the whole evergreen concentricity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.269" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">you got thrust onto the onto the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">national or international stage yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:11.340" style="s2">which I think in the long term will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">obviously in that positive given that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.340" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">his message is now finding a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">forum yeah I heard I heard you speaking</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">that day and you know I did hear you at</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">least alluding to if not explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:22.470" style="s2">using bet on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">topological language and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.470" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">something that&#39;s been deeply ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">into my own my own thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">ever since I started toying with ya my</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:33.330" style="s2">background was in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:35.190" style="s2">psychology and behavioral economics in</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.330" end="00:04:38.040" style="s2">college but I got really into</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.190" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">agent-based modeling mmm thinking around</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.040" end="00:04:42.120" style="s2">those types of systems and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.530" style="s2">adaptive landscapes and and playing with</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.120" end="00:04:45.540" style="s2">the variables to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.530" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">different you know modalities or phases</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.540" end="00:04:50.070" style="s2">of complex system dynamics and building</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">up an intuition for that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.070" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">that that sort of laid this neural</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:56.940" style="s2">framework for how I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:58.740" style="s2">absolutely everything and and from that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.940" end="00:05:00.780" style="s2">it seemed very obvious when I would try</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.740" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">to communicate particular ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.780" end="00:05:05.610" style="s2">I came to realize that that framework of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:07.380" style="s2">communication just it&#39;s it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.610" end="00:05:09.420" style="s2">the general consciousness right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.380" end="00:05:11.970" style="s2">so I thought generally it&#39;s not the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.420" end="00:05:13.380" style="s2">we tend to think about systems and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.970" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">is actually one of the topics that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know we don&#39;t need to jump</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">into it right now cuz there&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:19.830" style="s2">things that might be more important to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">speak about but I feel as if it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.830" end="00:05:27.420" style="s2">related to the limits of statistical</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:31.400" style="s2">understanding as we as we tend to use</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.420" end="00:05:31.400" style="s2">statistics in popular communication</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.139" end="00:05:38.020" style="s2">there are particular abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.970" end="00:05:40.040" style="s2">ways of communicating ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.020" end="00:05:43.400" style="s2">hangovers from more statistical as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.040" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">opposed to dynamical perspective hi</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.400" end="00:05:49.430" style="s2">I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:50.660" style="s2">therefore I&#39;m very intrigued so I agree</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:53.510" style="s2">with you I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.660" end="00:05:55.729" style="s2">the most interesting yet important place</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.510" end="00:05:58.910" style="s2">to go but thanks either let me apply a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.729" end="00:06:00.590" style="s2">heuristic though I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.910" end="00:06:03.500" style="s2">effort it would take to explore that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.590" end="00:06:05.479" style="s2">area but given the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:08.450" style="s2">always best in the beginning of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.479" end="00:06:10.130" style="s2">relationship to build coherence mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.450" end="00:06:12.500" style="s2">think about the fact that it just is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.130" end="00:06:13.669" style="s2">intrinsically interesting and is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.500" end="00:06:17.540" style="s2">example of a place where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.669" end="00:06:19.310" style="s2">current lack of obvious coherence it may</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.540" end="00:06:20.780" style="s2">actually heuristic would be useful to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.310" end="00:06:24.020" style="s2">basically put it out as a play space</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.780" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">mm-hmm to that to collaborate together</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.020" end="00:06:29.150" style="s2">on learning how to just share how we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.050" end="00:06:31.490" style="s2">come to understand more effectively yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.150" end="00:06:34.610" style="s2">that is general purpose always useful</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.490" end="00:06:35.889" style="s2">and probably is in fact justifies going</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.610" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.889" end="00:06:40.460" style="s2">maybe rationalizing just the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:41.810" style="s2">I&#39;m curious no no certainly certainly I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.460" end="00:06:43.790" style="s2">mean maybe I can just kind of try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.810" end="00:06:46.370" style="s2">reiterate and paraphrase it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.790" end="00:06:48.260" style="s2">that could give you a mental or</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.370" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">cognitive placeholder that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.260" end="00:06:53.150" style="s2">little bit more graspable than that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:55.940" style="s2">first pass which was not very clear um I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.150" end="00:07:00.340" style="s2">think the best way that I&#39;ve heard it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.940" end="00:07:02.840" style="s2">described succinctly was actually in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.340" end="00:07:04.760" style="s2">which book was it one of young Carl</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.840" end="00:07:06.440" style="s2">Jung&#39;s books in which he talks a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.760" end="00:07:09.830" style="s2">bit about he was a very simple example</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.440" end="00:07:11.600" style="s2">in terms of you know you have something</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.830" end="00:07:13.490" style="s2">like a hundred marble and the average</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.600" end="00:07:15.979" style="s2">weight of a marble might be something</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.490" end="00:07:17.870" style="s2">like 8.3 grams but you might very easily</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.979" end="00:07:20.330" style="s2">come to find out that no single marble</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.870" end="00:07:22.370" style="s2">is 8.3 grams right so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.330" end="00:07:24.320" style="s2">there&#39;s an abstraction of truth right</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.370" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">and that abstraction of truth has</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.320" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">certain utility it can be used for</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:31.550" style="s2">certain you could use as a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">certain purposes in the world more or</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.550" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">less effectively but there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:39.830" style="s2">space there&#39;s still like an abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">gap between the actual empirical or</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.830" end="00:07:44.660" style="s2">physical actuality of the system and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">abstraction of the statistical</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.660" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">understanding above that system ok and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:52.370" style="s2">and what I was talking about before is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.270" end="00:07:55.400" style="s2">that you know that the agent based</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.370" end="00:07:58.010" style="s2">intuition is far more of a bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.400" end="00:08:00.340" style="s2">intuition that that kind of bubbles up</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.010" end="00:08:03.860" style="s2">from the dynamics of the system as</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.340" end="00:08:05.690" style="s2">opposed to trying to use skull</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">abstractions from the top down yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.690" end="00:08:10.820" style="s2">understating completely perfect well</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:13.400" style="s2">done ok cool cool so with that out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.820" end="00:08:15.139" style="s2">the way um let me know what you think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.400" end="00:08:16.220" style="s2">I know you recently wrote something</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.139" end="00:08:18.470" style="s2">about Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.220" end="00:08:20.780" style="s2">I&#39;m currently I have something that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.470" end="00:08:23.630" style="s2">wrote that will be published fairly soon</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.780" end="00:08:25.340" style="s2">and in Poulet I think they are two</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.630" end="00:08:27.060" style="s2">slightly different perspectives but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.340" end="00:08:30.270" style="s2">think there</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.060" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">they could be you they feedback on one</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.270" end="00:08:34.740" style="s2">another in a way that could be quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:37.710" style="s2">useful to discuss okay perhaps maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.740" end="00:08:40.890" style="s2">could you know yours was from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.710" end="00:08:42.960" style="s2">perspective of fiduciary responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.890" end="00:08:44.580" style="s2">at Facebook so maybe you could just kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.960" end="00:08:46.710" style="s2">of elaborate your thought process on</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.580" end="00:08:48.420" style="s2">that and then I could come in and kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">of bounce off some of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.420" end="00:08:56.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been writing about sure so the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.750" end="00:09:02.610" style="s2">original motivation was actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.940" end="00:09:05.400" style="s2">a look at the evolving landscape at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.610" end="00:09:07.410" style="s2">pretty high level so including for</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.400" end="00:09:14.670" style="s2">example things like Internet of Things</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.410" end="00:09:17.970" style="s2">yep and well sensors in general and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.670" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">natural the natural path that these</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.970" end="00:09:23.370" style="s2">particular technological capacities</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.070" style="s2">portend</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.370" end="00:09:29.310" style="s2">is a generalization of the three</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.070" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">principles I put in my article the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.310" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">is that Facebook just happens to be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">early example of what will show up as</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:39.960" style="s2">being a nearly ubiquitous I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">just gonna call it a domain right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.960" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">channel said instead of a phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:46.110" style="s2">and so the the effort was to find</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">something so given the fact that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.110" end="00:09:49.560" style="s2">the case and given the fact that we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">find ourselves in a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.560" end="00:09:53.970" style="s2">strategically interesting location where</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.110" end="00:09:55.950" style="s2">a lot of attention is pointed at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.970" end="00:09:58.890" style="s2">problematic of Facebook right the canary</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.950" end="00:10:03.300" style="s2">in the coalmine is coughing vigorously</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.890" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">um an effort to find a way to there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.300" end="00:10:06.980" style="s2">about three things let me see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">hold all three simultaneously to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.980" end="00:10:11.580" style="s2">meaningfully and simply and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:17.250" style="s2">convey</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.580" end="00:10:21.000" style="s2">a way of structuring a space for that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.250" end="00:10:23.070" style="s2">entire domain that because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:26.400" style="s2">already been it&#39;s a kind of a principle</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.070" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">of biomimicry a way of structure in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.400" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">space that has already been the subject</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:35.520" style="s2">of a very long evolutionary history with</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">a variety of different early examples</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.520" end="00:10:40.020" style="s2">that actually show up in the same domain</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">so we get the advantage of not having to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.020" end="00:10:45.240" style="s2">to do sort of classic top-down design</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">but to be able to do something that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.240" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">my deep code group calls transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:52.280" style="s2">design which is something that utilizes</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:57.540" style="s2">both bottoms up and top-down methodology</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.280" end="00:11:02.280" style="s2">in a coherent space who to develop those</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.540" end="00:11:04.650" style="s2">kinds of structures and so that then led</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.280" end="00:11:07.650" style="s2">to the proposition that the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.650" end="00:11:09.210" style="s2">the douchy a responsibility which is as</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.089" end="00:11:21.029" style="s2">turns out to be a way of creating a well</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.600" end="00:11:23.779" style="s2">instantiating a structure that already</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.029" end="00:11:25.589" style="s2">lives at a deep level of intuition</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.779" end="00:11:28.199" style="s2">across the entire collective</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.610" end="00:12:11.579" style="s2">intuitive that hopefully would also have</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.110" end="00:12:36.640" style="s2">did I talk to you about Joe Edelman</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.670" end="00:12:40.030" style="s2">stuff um I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve discussed</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.640" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">it explicitly although I&#39;m like familiar</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.030" end="00:12:44.470" style="s2">in passing with okay so Joe the Joe is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.390" style="s2">not involved in this conversation but if</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.470" end="00:12:48.850" style="s2">you if you tap into the primary and move</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.390" end="00:12:50.140" style="s2">that he&#39;s making it&#39;s completely aligned</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.850" end="00:12:52.840" style="s2">with the primary move that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.140" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">as far as I can tell and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.840" end="00:12:58.420" style="s2">associated with this which is just say</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:13:01.900" style="s2">beginning to build skill sets at the</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.930" end="00:13:09.640" style="s2">lowest level um so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.170" end="00:13:11.080" style="s2">that was the other chart sort of driving</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.640" end="00:13:13.950" style="s2">back there which is to start to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.080" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">people to become aware of their own</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.950" end="00:13:19.960" style="s2">values complexes and how those value</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">complexes relate to each other and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.960" end="00:13:25.840" style="s2">show up and how they make sense move</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:27.550" style="s2">from making sense of to making choices</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.840" end="00:13:29.830" style="s2">in which is how I define meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.550" end="00:13:32.890" style="s2">in the world that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.830" end="00:13:34.630" style="s2">context yeah within a complex system I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.890" end="00:13:36.640" style="s2">kind of see those you know within that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.630" end="00:13:39.240" style="s2">meeting making framework kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.640" end="00:13:43.090" style="s2">them as like the nucleation events in</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.240" end="00:13:44.950" style="s2">the feed-forward process of of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.090" end="00:13:47.560" style="s2">instantiating structures that would</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.950" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">would then display your meaning or</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.560" end="00:13:52.030" style="s2">display values in society right so so</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:55.320" style="s2">you get you get environmental stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.030" end="00:13:57.370" style="s2">based on you know you know the way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.320" end="00:13:59.190" style="s2">the way that you perceive all of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.370" end="00:14:02.170" style="s2">stimuli is is this extremely layered</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.190" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">response that occurs across you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.170" end="00:14:07.420" style="s2">biological the so Sebald biological the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:09.580" style="s2">cultural technological layers at all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.420" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">these different I guess you might call</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.580" end="00:14:12.700" style="s2">frame rates of kind of iterative frame</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:13.930" style="s2">rates and they&#39;re all happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.700" end="00:14:18.950" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.930" end="00:14:20.750" style="s2">and so when information comes in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.950" end="00:14:22.520" style="s2">based on me I guess what you might</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.750" end="00:14:24.400" style="s2">characterize as self sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.520" end="00:14:27.380" style="s2">structures within the individual line</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.400" end="00:14:30.670" style="s2">you might grasp on two different facets</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.380" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">of that information or those stimuli and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.670" end="00:14:37.880" style="s2">therefore respond in a host of different</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:39.350" style="s2">ways based on what you perceive to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.880" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">the most relevant way to act in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.350" end="00:14:44.150" style="s2">environment yep and when those types of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:46.510" style="s2">patterns start clearing into something</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.150" end="00:14:50.360" style="s2">that gives you a response that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.510" end="00:14:51.740" style="s2">perhaps desirable or may you might even</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.360" end="00:14:54.610" style="s2">not be desirable it might be just</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.740" end="00:14:57.050" style="s2">addictive but but that kind of starts</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.610" end="00:14:58.430" style="s2">threading into the idea of meaning as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.050" end="00:15:01.970" style="s2">pattern it&#39;s something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.430" end="00:15:04.360" style="s2">actually grasp in a way that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.970" end="00:15:08.090" style="s2">subjectively relevant to your desire to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.360" end="00:15:10.250" style="s2">either consciously achieve a goal or act</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.090" end="00:15:13.460" style="s2">on behalf of one of the goals that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.250" end="00:15:16.270" style="s2">larger structures may have for you and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.460" end="00:15:18.680" style="s2">and have embedded inside of you right</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:20.750" style="s2">without your conscious knowledge whoo</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:22.790" style="s2">okay so you actually grab three distinct</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.750" end="00:15:24.140" style="s2">domains simultaneously and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.790" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">certain places where you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.140" end="00:15:30.180" style="s2">like drop to into a concept I saw it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:33.990" style="s2">like open like</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.180" end="00:15:35.580" style="s2">what was it the distinction between what</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.990" end="00:15:37.710" style="s2">is what is good and what is addictive</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.580" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">mm-hmm is what happens when you move</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.710" end="00:15:42.870" style="s2">from the perception to the through sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:44.610" style="s2">making into meaning making mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.870" end="00:15:47.730" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually precisely in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.610" end="00:15:50.610" style="s2">gap between the feed-forward and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.730" end="00:15:52.500" style="s2">feedback loop so you have a perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.610" end="00:15:55.110" style="s2">modality in a sense making set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.500" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">heuristics that endeavor to close the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.110" end="00:15:58.980" style="s2">binding between what is good and what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:00.390" style="s2">perceived as good mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.980" end="00:16:02.850" style="s2">and of course addiction lives in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.390" end="00:16:06.540" style="s2">gap right it is that which is perceived</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.850" end="00:16:08.490" style="s2">but is not good at a maximal level um so</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.540" end="00:16:11.459" style="s2">it&#39;s maximally perceived and minimally</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.490" end="00:16:12.899" style="s2">good is max is is you know the essence</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.459" end="00:16:14.250" style="s2">of addiction so that&#39;s like catching</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.899" end="00:16:16.290" style="s2">that catching what happens as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.250" end="00:16:18.899" style="s2">feedback loops and starts to come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.290" end="00:16:22.080" style="s2">from adaptive reality so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.899" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">in this sort of double double loop layer</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.080" end="00:16:25.649" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got your internal</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:28.610" style="s2">subjective processes that are moving</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.649" end="00:16:33.350" style="s2">from these boats a layered voci</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.610" end="00:16:35.910" style="s2">multimodal differentially frame rated</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.350" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">perception sense making meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.910" end="00:16:41.400" style="s2">choice making action taking processes</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:42.600" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got it which then in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.400" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">the sense making the media making you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.600" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">going to be making sure istic</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:48.150" style="s2">propositions around the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:50.339" style="s2">the consequences that you&#39;re perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.150" end="00:16:53.730" style="s2">are themselves good and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.339" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">simultaneously you have underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.730" end="00:16:57.029" style="s2">other half so I think of it as a circle</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">on the other half of the circle you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.029" end="00:17:01.709" style="s2">actual complex reality which is doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:03.810" style="s2">kind of the same thing which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.709" end="00:17:07.709" style="s2">that your actions are now propagating</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.810" end="00:17:08.939" style="s2">out into reality changing the context or</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.709" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">the niche the environment in which</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.939" end="00:17:13.410" style="s2">you&#39;re in and feeding back on you in</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:16.290" style="s2">ways that are propagating back up</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.410" end="00:17:19.650" style="s2">through that process which will show up</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.290" end="00:17:22.980" style="s2">as in fact actually adapted um and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.650" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">that&#39;s that sphere is is the total loop</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.980" end="00:17:25.530" style="s2">and it&#39;s really interesting that if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:28.410" style="s2">actually recognize that you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.530" end="00:17:29.970" style="s2">subjective objective slice and you run a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.410" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">sphere throughout all of that recognize</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.970" end="00:17:36.750" style="s2">that your sovereignty must contain that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">entire sphere mine your agency only</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.750" end="00:17:40.679" style="s2">lives in the top half of the sphere</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:43.809" style="s2">um and the inter mediate between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.679" end="00:17:48.669" style="s2">subjective and the object is the area of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.809" end="00:17:50.499" style="s2">um perceptual antigenic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.669" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">then that like that&#39;s the model that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.499" end="00:17:56.620" style="s2">work with okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:57.970" style="s2">I like the spherical idea so at some</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.620" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">point if we meet up I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.970" end="00:18:00.909" style="s2">actually show you some of the drawings</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.700" style="s2">that I mean quite a while ago when I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.909" end="00:18:05.639" style="s2">in San Francisco yeah okay so I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.700" end="00:18:07.509" style="s2">gonna be coming up there apparently uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.639" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">metallic and some of the other people</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.509" end="00:18:12.519" style="s2">cerium requested that I come up and give</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:15.669" style="s2">them some some advice and mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.519" end="00:18:18.580" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ll be coming up mainly to use</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.669" end="00:18:21.779" style="s2">that yes I think they&#39;re definitely in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:21.779" style="s2">need right now for sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.480" end="00:18:27.290" style="s2">you may night and I&#39;ll probably be up</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.820" end="00:18:30.050" style="s2">for a little while like maybe four or</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.290" end="00:18:31.160" style="s2">five days I&#39;m gonna meet up with other</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.050" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">another group of people called the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.160" end="00:18:35.390" style="s2">Terran collective okay you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.740" end="00:18:38.270" style="s2">have not heard of them time Aaron</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.390" end="00:18:42.380" style="s2">through your door garbage and Tibet</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.270" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">Sprague okay who because they all met at</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.380" end="00:18:48.200" style="s2">Burning Man also go by</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:50.360" style="s2">superhero names I know one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.200" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">prometheus I don&#39;t know the rest okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.360" end="00:18:54.790" style="s2">they&#39;re very interesting just to folks</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:58.280" style="s2">they got some good stuff going on with</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.790" end="00:19:00.500" style="s2">with Gao stack actually mmm they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.280" end="00:19:03.620" style="s2">doing a lot of like a real kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.500" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">really coherent product application</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.620" end="00:19:08.060" style="s2">development team but also it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">conceptual space that they&#39;re working in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.060" end="00:19:11.690" style="s2">so I&#39;m also gonna be hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:12.710" style="s2">them but it&#39;d be awesome to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.690" end="00:19:14.300" style="s2">able to connect with you when you say</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.710" end="00:19:17.210" style="s2">you live in San Francisco in the city</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.300" end="00:19:20.420" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;m a straight guy it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.210" end="00:19:23.090" style="s2">it&#39;s super easy ah yeah okay cool so</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.420" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">we&#39;ll all uh I&#39;ll make sure to reach out</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.090" end="00:19:27.380" style="s2">to you digitally to to find out how we</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">can do that well yeah I&#39;d love that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.380" end="00:19:33.050" style="s2">um to tie the kind of try</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:37.790" style="s2">take what you&#39;re saying and map it on to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.050" end="00:19:40.130" style="s2">some of the ideas that I was we began</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.790" end="00:19:41.810" style="s2">the conversation with respect to some of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.130" end="00:19:45.620" style="s2">my intuitions with respect and based</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.810" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">emergence when I was studying a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.620" end="00:19:51.020" style="s2">this stuff I was very deep into</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:53.780" style="s2">topological structures and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.020" end="00:19:56.660" style="s2">understand topological structures as not</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.780" end="00:20:00.040" style="s2">just landscapes but also potentially</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.660" end="00:20:02.420" style="s2">ways of thinking about the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.040" end="00:20:04.910" style="s2">information flow throughout complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.420" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">systems ok and so you&#39;re kind of talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.910" end="00:20:11.110" style="s2">about this sphere through which there</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.190" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">are these dynamic feedback loops moving</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.110" end="00:20:14.330" style="s2">encounter currents that are interacting</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">with one another</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.330" end="00:20:20.990" style="s2">yep in a way and I think that our</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.480" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">thinking there aligns and parallels one</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.990" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">another quite almost in an eerie fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.310" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s that&#39;s partly just</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:29.750" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to we&#39;re trying our</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.310" end="00:20:32.330" style="s2">best to perceive reality and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.750" end="00:20:34.160" style="s2">perceiving certain patterns that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.330" end="00:20:36.140" style="s2">know the words don&#39;t exist the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.160" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exists or we&#39;re grasping at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.140" end="00:20:40.010" style="s2">linguistic structure that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:42.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s within similar</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.010" end="00:20:44.540" style="s2">domains so yep are you familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.230" end="00:20:47.660" style="s2">idea of you know like a mobius strip</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.540" end="00:20:51.290" style="s2">right yep you know a Klein bottle the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.660" end="00:20:55.160" style="s2">yep okay so I was looking at this side</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.290" end="00:20:57.050" style="s2">you know these ideas through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.160" end="00:20:59.750" style="s2">the metaphor my mind was something along</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.050" end="00:21:02.690" style="s2">the lines of a nested Klein bottle in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.750" end="00:21:05.090" style="s2">which the point at which it intersects</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.690" end="00:21:08.120" style="s2">with itself you would insert yet another</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.090" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">type of Klein bottle information you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.120" end="00:21:12.770" style="s2">kind of look at the the top of it as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">top of the agenting surface that makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.770" end="00:21:17.150" style="s2">contact with the environment yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:19.700" style="s2">then when the information you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.150" end="00:21:23.750" style="s2">of picture the information flowing down</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.700" end="00:21:26.920" style="s2">one side of it into the nested recursion</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.750" end="00:21:26.920" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.020" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">but then converging two points at some</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">layer of depth at which it decides to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:37.900" style="s2">travel back up the recursive surface</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:40.910" style="s2">yeah on the inside of that same topology</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.900" end="00:21:43.010" style="s2">yep so now you have information flowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.910" end="00:21:47.380" style="s2">down the recursive topological structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.010" end="00:21:51.310" style="s2">on one side and up it on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.380" end="00:21:54.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s a loo but there&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.310" end="00:21:55.980" style="s2">flowing up and down</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.090" end="00:21:58.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a membrane right which is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.980" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">quote-unquote surface yep well then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.049" end="00:22:01.049" style="s2">not too far from there to think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:03.330" style="s2">there might be some sort of information</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.049" end="00:22:06.419" style="s2">exchange or receptors between you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.330" end="00:22:08.250" style="s2">information moving up the loop from</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.419" end="00:22:08.940" style="s2">various depths right and I kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.250" end="00:22:10.679" style="s2">at when I talk about these different</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.940" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">time frames I would kind of map the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.679" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">different time frames of codified</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:18.419" style="s2">structures to the different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:23.730" style="s2">recursion of this nested klein bottle</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.419" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">structure and so in the deepest version</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.730" end="00:22:28.710" style="s2">so certain some information would</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:30.299" style="s2">trigger something that happens in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.710" end="00:22:32.250" style="s2">environment some information might flow</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.299" end="00:22:34.440" style="s2">all the way down to your deepest</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.250" end="00:22:37.049" style="s2">evolutionary structures and interact</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.440" end="00:22:39.350" style="s2">with something there and only at that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.049" end="00:22:42.659" style="s2">point would it codify and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.350" end="00:22:45.720" style="s2">activate a neural structure that then</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.659" end="00:22:47.399" style="s2">flowed back up that system but but</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.720" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s quite rare because most the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.399" end="00:22:51.059" style="s2">it&#39;s like a sieve or like a sierpinski</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.789" style="s2">gasket or something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.059" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">where most of the time it would it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.789" end="00:23:00.450" style="s2">activate something far more recent and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:23:02.789" style="s2">and those loops I&#39;m thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.450" end="00:23:04.470" style="s2">the the concept to tie this to some</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.789" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">extent back into Facebook in social</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.470" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">media I&#39;m thinking about the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:15.210" style="s2">structures of communication and the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:17.549" style="s2">that we interact with information how</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.210" end="00:23:20.059" style="s2">does it impact our ability to exist at</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.549" end="00:23:23.170" style="s2">different levels of that recursion and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.059" end="00:23:26.230" style="s2">what is the application of that like</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.170" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">how are we creating structures that trap</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.230" end="00:23:32.310" style="s2">us at the surface of that structure</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.810" style="s2">and prevent us from existing within some</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.310" end="00:23:37.980" style="s2">of the deeper cultural and historical</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.810" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">patterns of thought in a way I was kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.980" end="00:23:41.730" style="s2">of like I don&#39;t know I&#39;m trying to stack</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:43.650" style="s2">too many I&#39;m trying to talk too many</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.730" end="00:23:45.510" style="s2">concepts right now it&#39;s instead that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.650" end="00:23:47.100" style="s2">serious stack but let&#39;s that&#39;s well why</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.510" end="00:23:49.380" style="s2">don&#39;t we grab grab the last thing you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.100" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">said and pivot on that yes sir</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.380" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">contextual eyes it in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.850" end="00:23:56.190" style="s2">situation of Facebook we have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:57.660" style="s2">simple articulation of Facebook I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.190" end="00:23:59.970" style="s2">hold the entire stack that you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.660" end="00:24:01.260" style="s2">articulated it at at least antic label</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.970" end="00:24:02.760" style="s2">that you articulated it&#39;s not in depth</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.260" end="00:24:04.680" style="s2">for sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.760" end="00:24:06.210" style="s2">but if we start back at the prosaic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.680" end="00:24:08.340" style="s2">I think those two touch points might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.210" end="00:24:10.520" style="s2">good so retell that story just for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.340" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">point of view of Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.520" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">so just from the point of Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:15.740" style="s2">perhaps like it uses to lead into</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:17.390" style="s2">actually what I&#39;m writing about which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.740" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">not directly related to this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.390" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">somewhat related to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.260" end="00:24:26.310" style="s2">you have to forgive me to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.060" end="00:24:30.120" style="s2">because for many of these ideas I just I</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.310" end="00:24:31.740" style="s2">haven&#39;t articulated them within my own</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.120" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">mind and tonight can I introduce</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.740" end="00:24:37.470" style="s2">something to you mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.480" end="00:24:40.980" style="s2">so by the way welcome to deep code so</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.470" end="00:24:43.530" style="s2">the it&#39;s called rule Omega okay rule</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.980" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">Omega is the the only ethical and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.530" end="00:24:50.340" style="s2">epistemological principle of beat code</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">and what it articulates is what you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.340" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">said and but also the ethical corollary</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">which is if I am operating under Rule</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:03.570" style="s2">Omega then you recognize that I am the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:08.250" style="s2">kind of being that is endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.570" end="00:25:11.370" style="s2">grasp really deep difficult distant</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.250" end="00:25:13.710" style="s2">nuanced things and by definition when</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.370" end="00:25:17.280" style="s2">I&#39;m expressing them to you they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.710" end="00:25:19.230" style="s2">to be very hard to understand in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.280" end="00:25:21.410" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet even come close to figuring</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.230" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">what the hell I&#39;m doing yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.410" end="00:25:27.750" style="s2">however in I am absolutely acting in</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:31.050" style="s2">good faith to try to do this thing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.750" end="00:25:32.970" style="s2">collaboration with you and you by</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.050" end="00:25:35.670" style="s2">agreeing to rule Omega are also</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.970" end="00:25:39.540" style="s2">operating in absolute good faith to try</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.670" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">to listen and to collaborate with me so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.540" end="00:25:43.050" style="s2">that we are forming a shared</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">consciousness to do this work that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.050" end="00:25:47.880" style="s2">are in fact both doing simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:48.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a love it it&#39;s associate with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.880" end="00:25:50.370" style="s2">thing you said earlier which is they</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.840" end="00:25:54.920" style="s2">were trying to for trying to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.370" end="00:25:58.730" style="s2">reality mm-hmm and that ain&#39;t easy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.920" end="00:26:01.980" style="s2">we&#39;re very poorly equipped to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.730" end="00:26:02.940" style="s2">understatement of the year so this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.980" end="00:26:04.710" style="s2">like it&#39;s like rule Omega is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.940" end="00:26:06.690" style="s2">ultimate maiya culpa you are fully</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.710" end="00:26:11.820" style="s2">forgiven from the beginning so you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.690" end="00:26:14.370" style="s2">free and safe to try and do do your most</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.820" end="00:26:17.430" style="s2">acrobatic work and sort of I&#39;ll do my</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.370" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">best to serve it as a net but of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.430" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">will also be simultaneously doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:24.420" style="s2">that same thing so it&#39;s a mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:29.790" style="s2">real like real time jazz acrobatics over</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.420" end="00:26:32.490" style="s2">a over a pit hahaha okay okay so I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.790" end="00:26:33.960" style="s2">step back and try to tell the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.490" end="00:26:35.900" style="s2">story and tie it into what I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.960" end="00:26:39.040" style="s2">discussing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.900" end="00:26:39.040" style="s2">I think it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.150" end="00:26:46.740" style="s2">to discuss it through the lens of</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.580" end="00:30:05.510" style="s2">then it becomes a question of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.380" end="00:30:07.040" style="s2">what is your what is your and this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.510" end="00:30:09.320" style="s2">this ties into yourself sovereignty idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.040" end="00:30:11.420" style="s2">like what is your sampling rate what are</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.320" end="00:30:14.800" style="s2">the types of things that you target how</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.420" end="00:30:14.800" style="s2">do you make sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.480" end="00:30:22.620" style="s2">look it would sat on sorry my phone my</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.289" end="00:30:23.880" style="s2">phone was ringing um how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.620" end="00:30:25.399" style="s2">you actually you know what are your</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.880" end="00:30:28.769" style="s2">interpretive frameworks that you apply</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.769" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">decreasing radius symbols and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:36.570" style="s2">is there some point at which no</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:40.860" style="s2">interpretative framework may be</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.570" end="00:30:46.850" style="s2">sufficient for any one agent to have the</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:53.570" style="s2">therefore you know I think perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.400" end="00:30:56.180" style="s2">some extent that&#39;s that&#39;s the point at</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.570" end="00:30:59.330" style="s2">which collective intelligence becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.180" end="00:31:03.620" style="s2">not merely useful but perhaps the only</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:05.810" style="s2">mechanism of you know the only possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.620" end="00:31:07.160" style="s2">the only possible technology or the only</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.160" end="00:31:12.620" style="s2">to allow us to thread the existential</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.870" style="s2">needle right yeah oh and so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.620" end="00:31:16.550" style="s2">of I kind of look at that as a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.870" end="00:31:18.380" style="s2">an accelerating nature to that right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.550" end="00:31:19.940" style="s2">so then the question becomes with</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.380" end="00:31:23.980" style="s2">respect to something like Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.940" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">social media how</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.980" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">how much of that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.090" end="00:31:33.630" style="s2">if you if you use if you use the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.020" end="00:31:35.830" style="s2">try to develop systems that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.630" end="00:31:39.070" style="s2">intentionally leverage the human brain</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.830" end="00:31:42.730" style="s2">to lock people within systems that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.070" end="00:31:45.610" style="s2">are not well equipped to navigate or</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.730" end="00:31:49.810" style="s2">make sense within what is that doing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.610" end="00:31:52.120" style="s2">their what is that doing to their their</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.810" end="00:31:56.530" style="s2">ability to engage with the other parts</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.120" end="00:31:59.500" style="s2">of contextual reality or deep time or</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.530" end="00:32:01.810" style="s2">deep deep code perhaps that they may</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.500" end="00:32:04.900" style="s2">need to be able to even become a useful</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.810" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">part of the collective intelligence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.900" end="00:32:13.450" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely correct the short</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:15.910" style="s2">answer is it degrades yeah and there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.450" end="00:32:18.790" style="s2">should return another essay about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.910" end="00:32:20.530" style="s2">about two months ago mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.790" end="00:32:21.610" style="s2">I think called what&#39;s the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.530" end="00:32:22.300" style="s2">social media or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.610" end="00:32:24.400" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.300" end="00:32:28.050" style="s2">or I actually explicate those ideas more</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.400" end="00:32:31.480" style="s2">deeply and it&#39;s actually I think five</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.050" end="00:32:34.570" style="s2">distinct characteristics of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.480" end="00:32:37.210" style="s2">phenomena so what one for example I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.570" end="00:32:41.770" style="s2">I think I&#39;m doing it at one or two</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.210" end="00:32:44.890" style="s2">levels of abstraction or less</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.770" end="00:32:47.650" style="s2">abstraction than you are right now but</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.890" end="00:32:49.810" style="s2">for example the the problematic of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.650" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">relationship between weak and strong</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.810" end="00:32:54.460" style="s2">social links that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">optimization so yeah so you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.460" end="00:32:57.340" style="s2">finite amount of attention and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.280" style="s2">got a finite amount of adaptive capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.340" end="00:33:03.130" style="s2">now this seems just true it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.280" end="00:33:05.620" style="s2">but it seems to be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.130" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">you&#39;re always we are wired to always be</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.620" end="00:33:11.259" style="s2">using our maximum adaptive capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.870" style="s2">the and in the context of where it makes</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.259" end="00:33:15.700" style="s2">sense for us to point our attention and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.870" end="00:33:17.799" style="s2">in the context of something like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.700" end="00:33:20.649" style="s2">social network like Facebook what ends</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.799" end="00:33:24.820" style="s2">up happening is that we&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.649" end="00:33:27.429" style="s2">simulation that grabs a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.820" end="00:33:30.309" style="s2">amount of our attention precisely</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.429" end="00:33:32.169" style="s2">because it plays on very very</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.309" end="00:33:34.509" style="s2">effectively plays on that gap between</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.169" end="00:33:35.820" style="s2">what seems to be good and what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.509" end="00:33:40.929" style="s2">actually good for us</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.820" end="00:33:46.889" style="s2">um and it does so in a way that turns</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.929" end="00:33:46.889" style="s2">our adaptive capacity to to optimize for</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.410" end="00:33:51.810" style="s2">complicated rather than complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.130" end="00:33:54.500" style="s2">environments this is something that Joe</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.160" end="00:34:12.570" style="s2">actually apparently as far as we can I</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.530" end="00:34:50.420" style="s2">I have a good reason to believe but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.970" end="00:34:53.750" style="s2">cannot quite recall why um there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.420" end="00:34:55.550" style="s2">actually that&#39;s not that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.750" end="00:34:57.890" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.550" end="00:35:00.589" style="s2">demonstrate that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.890" end="00:35:02.839" style="s2">and that the topology of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.589" end="00:35:06.049" style="s2">collective intelligence mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.839" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">always fails mm-hmm and in fact always</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.049" end="00:35:10.670" style="s2">fails in an accelerating finite time</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:12.859" style="s2">meaning the more you progress towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.670" end="00:35:13.999" style="s2">that nodal point the more rapid it</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.859" end="00:35:16.069" style="s2">actually collapses</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.999" end="00:35:18.019" style="s2">I think it&#39;s isomorphic with the reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.069" end="00:35:19.609" style="s2">that complicated systems collapsed so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.019" end="00:35:21.950" style="s2">ends up being sort of a similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.609" end="00:35:23.509" style="s2">fundamental dynamic mm-hm which is why</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.950" end="00:35:25.369" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult like it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.509" end="00:35:29.140" style="s2">unpacking the same fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.369" end="00:35:32.799" style="s2">conceptual scheme across three different</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.140" end="00:35:32.799" style="s2">material or physical instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.500" end="00:35:39.740" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s gotta be go ahead I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.830" end="00:35:41.960" style="s2">meet her up you know no it&#39;s fine um so</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.740" end="00:35:45.020" style="s2">let me let me try something on for size</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.960" end="00:35:46.460" style="s2">here it&#39;s a metaphor that I used to more</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.020" end="00:35:49.700" style="s2">maybe more of an intuition pump but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.460" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">used to try to navigate this idea myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.700" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">and let me just maybe just frame it in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">the idea that I would posit that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:36:03.460" style="s2">issue may be that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:03.460" style="s2">the way that the connective structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.530" end="00:36:09.640" style="s2">Valls disconnects us from all of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.350" end="00:36:14.270" style="s2">prior evolutionary knowledge in a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.640" end="00:36:17.480" style="s2">that makes the system fragile yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.270" end="00:36:19.190" style="s2">the way I kind of used this idea to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.480" end="00:36:24.710" style="s2">conceptualize it to some extent is and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.190" end="00:36:27.320" style="s2">imagine I imagine the sum total of human</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.710" end="00:36:29.690" style="s2">knowledge not just a conscious explicit</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.320" end="00:36:31.700" style="s2">knowledge but you know even the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.690" end="00:36:34.520" style="s2">knowledge that we have latent within us</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.700" end="00:36:37.220" style="s2">or just our historical systems or</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.520" end="00:36:39.470" style="s2">systems of record or artefactual history</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.220" end="00:36:41.420" style="s2">that we may not have fully extracted all</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.470" end="00:36:43.550" style="s2">useful information from but but it all</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.420" end="00:36:46.760" style="s2">exists layer upon layer but I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.550" end="00:36:50.060" style="s2">look at it as a sphere and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.760" end="00:36:52.820" style="s2">is this layered liquid and the closer</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.060" end="00:36:55.730" style="s2">into the center of that liquid sphere</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.820" end="00:36:59.840" style="s2">you go the viscosity increases and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.730" end="00:37:01.880" style="s2">buoyancy you know your your push your it</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.840" end="00:37:03.500" style="s2">takes the further you go into the center</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.880" end="00:37:05.510" style="s2">the more energy it takes to move further</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.500" end="00:37:06.980" style="s2">into the center right yep and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.510" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">it&#39;s hard enough it&#39;s like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.980" end="00:37:12.170" style="s2">think of it like without any conscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:13.640" style="s2">cognitive effort will float on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.170" end="00:37:17.530" style="s2">surface and Bob there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.640" end="00:37:17.530" style="s2">probably the point of you know least</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.730" end="00:37:20.790" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.749" end="00:37:27.339" style="s2">sorry my phone is just going crazy I</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.049" end="00:37:29.829" style="s2">need to remember to disconnect it from</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.339" end="00:37:34.859" style="s2">all of the otherwise integrated systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.829" end="00:37:34.859" style="s2">next time I take a conference call so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.390" end="00:37:40.360" style="s2">surface floating least yeah okay so all</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.880" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">right cool</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.360" end="00:37:47.800" style="s2">so and in the state of in the state of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.510" end="00:37:48.910" style="s2">non exact aynd of at this point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.800" end="00:37:51.430" style="s2">at this point where you&#39;re bobbing on</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.910" end="00:37:53.650" style="s2">the surface and that point is you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.430" end="00:37:56.500" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of a minimal perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:37:58.330" style="s2">minimal suffering in terms of just the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.500" end="00:38:00.840" style="s2">amount of effort that you might have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.330" end="00:38:04.210" style="s2">put yourself through to extract</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.840" end="00:38:09.430" style="s2">otherwise useful value from this</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.210" end="00:38:13.930" style="s2">structure that from this structure that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.430" end="00:38:15.850" style="s2">that otherwise resists our ability to to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.930" end="00:38:18.220" style="s2">extract knowledge from it and this kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.850" end="00:38:20.530" style="s2">of maps to Peterson&#39;s idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:22.210" style="s2">archetype of chaos right but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.530" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">the deeper it&#39;s kind of like the sphere</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.210" end="00:38:26.050" style="s2">of chaos you can even look at it you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:27.400" style="s2">could look at it at that although he</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.050" end="00:38:30.940" style="s2">maps that idea to more of like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.400" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">external domain of the unknown but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.940" end="00:38:36.430" style="s2">think that it can also be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:39.160" style="s2">this this domain of our own our own</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.430" end="00:38:41.080" style="s2">unknown in common polluted involuted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.160" end="00:38:42.550" style="s2">the Union and unconsciousness and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.080" end="00:38:46.210" style="s2">figured it you&#39;ll get a closure on it</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.550" end="00:38:48.190" style="s2">okay okay and then then the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.210" end="00:38:49.930" style="s2">part and then that part is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.190" end="00:38:51.070" style="s2">necessarily the most part about this the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.930" end="00:38:53.560" style="s2">most interesting part about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.070" end="00:38:54.910" style="s2">you know we have to we have to dive we</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.560" end="00:38:56.020" style="s2">have to develop structures in the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.910" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">way that you would develop a structure</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.020" end="00:38:59.500" style="s2">to actually dive underneath the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.570" style="s2">you know you need to have a scuba tank</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.500" end="00:39:03.100" style="s2">or you need to have a submarine you need</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.570" end="00:39:05.560" style="s2">to have these these mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.100" end="00:39:07.420" style="s2">allow you to withstand pressure and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.560" end="00:39:09.850" style="s2">not be pushed back up to the surface or</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.420" end="00:39:13.330" style="s2">drown in the depths of this this</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.850" end="00:39:15.609" style="s2">otherwise this otherwise volatile and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.330" end="00:39:16.900" style="s2">hostile hostile environment to to our</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.609" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">particular consciousness and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.900" end="00:39:22.510" style="s2">like you then we created these</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:25.150" style="s2">structures of social media or or our</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.510" end="00:39:27.430" style="s2">connectivity not only are we buoyant at</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.150" end="00:39:29.500" style="s2">the top we&#39;ve also created a massive</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.430" end="00:39:32.500" style="s2">network that creates a surface tension</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.500" end="00:39:34.270" style="s2">in a way and maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.500" end="00:39:36.130" style="s2">of maybe that&#39;s the the one takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.270" end="00:39:37.869" style="s2">from this whole metaphorical structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.130" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">is that you know we have these different</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.869" end="00:39:43.339" style="s2">layers of communication that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:46.309" style="s2">incentivize particular modes of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.339" end="00:39:48.060" style="s2">interaction and to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.309" end="00:39:50.820" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.060" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">enmeshed in that surface tension you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.820" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">going to spend even less time diving</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:59.100" style="s2">under the depths of this this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:01.020" style="s2">this kind of like the sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.100" end="00:40:03.600" style="s2">knowledge and actually spending the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.020" end="00:40:05.640" style="s2">energy to take those deep dives and stay</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">in those deeper layers because you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.640" end="00:40:09.720" style="s2">this is the idea we have these this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:11.580" style="s2">concept of FOMO that&#39;s now very much in</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.720" end="00:40:13.290" style="s2">the zeitgeist and I think this we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.580" end="00:40:15.630" style="s2">kind of trying to articulate this notion</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.290" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">of an extreme surface tension to one</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.630" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">another because we have extreme</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.600" style="s2">visibility into one another&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:23.750" style="s2">extreme visibility into all of the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.600" end="00:40:28.200" style="s2">processes that are going on at that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.750" end="00:40:30.200" style="s2">behavioral surface and that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.200" end="00:40:32.820" style="s2">pull us away from the types of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.200" end="00:40:34.830" style="s2">exploration of the the invisible the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.820" end="00:40:36.450" style="s2">exploration of the historical the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.830" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">excellent you know the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.450" end="00:40:40.020" style="s2">the textual it creates this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:41.970" style="s2">gravitational pull away from it or</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.020" end="00:40:43.380" style="s2">surface tension I don&#39;t know like I said</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.970" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">this is this is all just in my head now</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.380" end="00:40:47.700" style="s2">so I need to articulate it before can</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.730" end="00:40:49.819" style="s2">actually spell it out in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.700" end="00:40:52.789" style="s2">compelling I think but</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.819" end="00:40:53.180" style="s2">that raw material I&#39;ll toss it off to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.789" end="00:40:56.359" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.180" end="00:40:58.069" style="s2">nice that was that was that was terrible</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.359" end="00:41:01.880" style="s2">but would you would you would you like</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.069" end="00:41:03.979" style="s2">to be the the bass player yeah that felt</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.880" end="00:41:06.019" style="s2">like bass to me I was just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.979" end="00:41:09.019" style="s2">the Jazz so you do we just handed it off</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.019" end="00:41:12.859" style="s2">to uh to Mingus to play a little bass</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.019" end="00:41:15.229" style="s2">solo alright so what are the cut one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.859" end="00:41:16.369" style="s2">the terms that you used is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.229" end="00:41:18.859" style="s2">term that I wanted to bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.369" end="00:41:20.390" style="s2">conversation which was viscosity so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.859" end="00:41:26.589" style="s2">gonna play with viscosity for a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.390" end="00:41:31.239" style="s2">bit in this metaphor so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.589" end="00:41:34.809" style="s2">a feedback or a relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.239" end="00:41:38.769" style="s2">surface and the debt in this sphere um</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.809" end="00:41:40.719" style="s2">and it is a relationship that has the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.769" end="00:41:44.170" style="s2">the the deeper you go the higher the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.719" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">viscosity this means two things one is</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.170" end="00:41:53.769" style="s2">the more energy that is necessary to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:56.769" style="s2">able to cause it to move yep and the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.769" end="00:42:00.759" style="s2">more leverage it has on causing movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.769" end="00:42:04.660" style="s2">in the other opposite direction yes so</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.759" end="00:42:08.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the the atmosphere of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.660" end="00:42:12.489" style="s2">Jupiter yeah you know as the as Jupiter</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.430" end="00:42:14.019" style="s2">rotates the core yeah I guess the deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.489" end="00:42:16.509" style="s2">the deeper you go the more subject you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.019" end="00:42:16.900" style="s2">would be to its inertial forces that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.509" end="00:42:20.819" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.900" end="00:42:20.819" style="s2">and the more</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.550" end="00:42:31.330" style="s2">the floor and more intense the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.180" end="00:42:34.350" style="s2">execution the the execution of energy is</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.330" end="00:42:34.350" style="s2">to generate</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.960" end="00:42:41.089" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna just say change I can&#39;t go any</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:43.400" style="s2">further than that yeah all right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.089" end="00:42:46.220" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece and it also speaks the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.400" end="00:42:48.820" style="s2">idea of the deep code the notion of deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.220" end="00:42:51.400" style="s2">code because</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.820" end="00:42:53.020" style="s2">keep code maybe you know the energy</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.400" end="00:42:56.710" style="s2">required to actually change that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.020" end="00:43:00.300" style="s2">structural you know code of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.710" end="00:43:03.100" style="s2">requires this this massive exertion to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.300" end="00:43:04.840" style="s2">to yield even smallest of results but</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.100" end="00:43:07.240" style="s2">because it underlies every other</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.840" end="00:43:09.870" style="s2">structure those small changes may be</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.240" end="00:43:12.870" style="s2">enough that&#39;s right that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.870" end="00:43:12.870" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.420" end="00:43:17.770" style="s2">well okay so let&#39;s just slide to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.130" end="00:43:21.850" style="s2">pretty quickly let me tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.770" end="00:43:23.080" style="s2">we&#39;re doing um I could probably give it</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.850" end="00:43:25.390" style="s2">to you in its raw form but let me give</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.080" end="00:43:27.490" style="s2">it to you in a slightly simpler form and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.390" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">then come back there&#39;s a guy named Tom</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.490" end="00:43:32.770" style="s2">sheet tom is working was the was one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:36.370" style="s2">the first guys I think the founder of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.770" end="00:43:39.310" style="s2">Google X then he left and he is working</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.370" end="00:43:43.090" style="s2">on trying to do very kind of practical</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.310" end="00:43:45.640" style="s2">things in large-scale system dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.090" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">specifically he grasped the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.640" end="00:43:49.930" style="s2">carbon remediation right so he looked at</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:52.120" style="s2">the whole system and said oh where</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.930" end="00:43:54.040" style="s2">the places were sort of in the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.120" end="00:43:56.470" style="s2">trouble in the students time frame and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.040" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">the most distant from any viable</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.470" end="00:44:04.050" style="s2">solution and he found in two places one</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">was coral reefs and the other one was</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.050" end="00:44:08.710" style="s2">carbon remediation so the proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re already so far out over our</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.710" end="00:44:12.010" style="s2">skis on carbon that even if we cut</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:13.510" style="s2">emissions to zero wouldn&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.010" end="00:44:15.850" style="s2">anything we have to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.510" end="00:44:18.780" style="s2">extremely good at pulling it out of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.850" end="00:44:20.860" style="s2">atmosphere and yeah and sequestering it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.780" end="00:44:24.940" style="s2">so then and this is this is the key</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.860" end="00:44:26.770" style="s2">point he then ran a sort of a design</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.940" end="00:44:29.590" style="s2">spec on what is a what does a viable</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.770" end="00:44:31.960" style="s2">solution even look like um and what are</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.590" end="00:44:36.040" style="s2">the parameters and so what he was able</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.960" end="00:44:37.360" style="s2">to discover or identify was that we had</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.040" end="00:44:40.420" style="s2">to get to the point where we were</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.360" end="00:44:42.910" style="s2">pulling something like 10 Giga tons of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.420" end="00:44:49.600" style="s2">carbon from the atmosphere on an annual</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.910" end="00:44:50.980" style="s2">basis by 2025 to have any to be a viable</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.600" end="00:44:52.450" style="s2">solution we should just say that if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.980" end="00:44:57.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t get that amount in that timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.450" end="00:44:58.840" style="s2">or sooner then the feedback loops of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.070" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">dijkstra the destabilization in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.840" end="00:45:01.630" style="s2">larger system start to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:03.010" style="s2">control pretty quickly like there might</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.630" end="00:45:05.130" style="s2">be plus or minus two or three years but</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.010" end="00:45:07.270" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a a nice envelope yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.130" end="00:45:08.920" style="s2">which is the type of conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.270" end="00:45:11.110" style="s2">we really can&#39;t meaningfully have in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.920" end="00:45:13.000" style="s2">public consciousness and miss climate in</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.110" end="00:45:14.680" style="s2">terms of you know the the sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.000" end="00:45:15.880" style="s2">dependence on those thresholds and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.680" end="00:45:19.600" style="s2">that actually means or might look like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.880" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">if it does and you know to kind of start</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.600" end="00:45:22.930" style="s2">Sur kind of falling into that phase</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:26.760" style="s2">shift you know yep yeah for sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.930" end="00:45:27.930" style="s2">a sort of a meaningful problem and well</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.760" end="00:45:30.540" style="s2">actually oddly enough so we&#39;ll get there</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.930" end="00:45:33.300" style="s2">in a second so so the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.540" end="00:45:35.130" style="s2">once you can characterize correctly</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.300" end="00:45:36.750" style="s2">characterize what a viable solution must</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.130" end="00:45:39.870" style="s2">look like it that&#39;s one characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.750" end="00:45:41.820" style="s2">where I guess it&#39;s three others have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.870" end="00:45:46.040" style="s2">have to do with the fact that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.820" end="00:45:48.090" style="s2">it must also not generate unanticipated</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.040" end="00:45:50.220" style="s2">consequences in other domains right it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.090" end="00:45:51.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do us any good to do carbon</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.220" end="00:45:53.330" style="s2">remediation in the fashion that for</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.930" end="00:45:55.650" style="s2">example lipstick say accelerates</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.330" end="00:45:58.230" style="s2">collapse the coral reefs you know so it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.650" end="00:46:00.120" style="s2">has to be from a biomimicry perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.230" end="00:46:02.670" style="s2">a do no harm solution that also hits</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.120" end="00:46:04.650" style="s2">this design criteria mmm-hmm once the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.670" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">design criteria are put in place then</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.650" end="00:46:06.900" style="s2">you can begin the process of actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:08.040" style="s2">trying to figure out how to construct a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.900" end="00:46:10.350" style="s2">solution and see if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.040" end="00:46:12.540" style="s2">within the viable design space that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.350" end="00:46:14.190" style="s2">actually works as it turns out he</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.540" end="00:46:17.030" style="s2">actually found one on its that&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.190" end="00:46:19.080" style="s2">and so he&#39;s in the process right now of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.030" end="00:46:20.970" style="s2">building it and making it and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.080" end="00:46:23.340" style="s2">instantiate it the point is that deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.970" end="00:46:24.930" style="s2">code tried to do is endeavoring to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.340" end="00:46:29.820" style="s2">that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.930" end="00:46:31.530" style="s2">at the most fundamental level all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.820" end="00:46:34.050" style="s2">so if you take a look at the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.530" end="00:46:37.470" style="s2">the total problem can we articulate the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.050" end="00:46:40.890" style="s2">total problem um with enough clarity</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.470" end="00:46:43.980" style="s2">that we can then use it to define the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.890" end="00:46:48.170" style="s2">design space of any necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.980" end="00:46:51.950" style="s2">sufficient solution and so for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.170" end="00:46:55.350" style="s2">the criteria the feedback between any</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.950" end="00:46:57.870" style="s2">possible set of rival risk games in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.350" end="00:47:00.990" style="s2">context of any exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.870" end="00:47:04.310" style="s2">accelerating technological capacity it</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.990" end="00:47:04.310" style="s2">turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.500" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">one of the primary parameters in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.050" end="00:47:09.960" style="s2">may be the only one that matters because</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">everything else if you solve for that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.960" end="00:47:13.850" style="s2">everything else actually you kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:18.490" style="s2">for free as far as we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.850" end="00:47:21.470" style="s2">and the binding strength or the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.490" end="00:47:24.620" style="s2">resilience to change that is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.470" end="00:47:28.820" style="s2">to resolve that requires a level of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.620" end="00:47:30.920" style="s2">structural depth that is extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.820" end="00:47:32.900" style="s2">meaning you actually have to go down to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.920" end="00:47:35.810" style="s2">things that may in fact just flat-out be</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.900" end="00:47:37.970" style="s2">invariant under all transforms mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.810" end="00:47:41.360" style="s2">think if this is oh oh fun okay so</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.970" end="00:47:43.070" style="s2">here&#39;s a different concept this notion</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.360" end="00:47:44.840" style="s2">of viscosity is perfect because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.070" end="00:47:47.870" style="s2">allows you to do is also use the notion</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.840" end="00:47:49.700" style="s2">of temperature and you can use that to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.870" end="00:47:51.950" style="s2">then think of intensity so if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.700" end="00:47:53.650" style="s2">you talked about this earlier so when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.950" end="00:47:55.550" style="s2">innovate a new capacity to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.650" end="00:47:57.770" style="s2">intensity what I ain&#39;t what I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.550" end="00:48:00.920" style="s2">do is relate to things that I used to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.770" end="00:48:03.170" style="s2">have to conceive of as solid has</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.920" end="00:48:08.690" style="s2">actually now being liquid I can melt</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.170" end="00:48:12.320" style="s2">stuff and so the problematic is that if</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.690" end="00:48:15.100" style="s2">you&#39;re building a self sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.320" end="00:48:15.100" style="s2">structure on</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.210" end="00:48:23.110" style="s2">structures that are meltable then</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.280" end="00:48:26.290" style="s2">you actually end up being in deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.110" end="00:48:29.050" style="s2">trouble yeah so you have to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.290" end="00:48:33.790" style="s2">to find something that is actually will</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.050" end="00:48:37.060" style="s2">show up as solid under infinite agency</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.790" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">yeah so I think to some extent then the</p>

<p begin="00:49:10.300" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">we&#39;re actually in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:14.920" style="s2">discovering what is you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:17.380" style="s2">known to be hundreds or thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.920" end="00:49:19.210" style="s2">different types of matter right new</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.380" end="00:49:20.530" style="s2">states of matter and not only are we</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.210" end="00:49:22.060" style="s2">discovering new states of matter that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.530" end="00:49:24.369" style="s2">are these exotic states that matter but</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.060" end="00:49:27.670" style="s2">we&#39;re also starting to leverage what</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.369" end="00:49:30.220" style="s2">we&#39;re learning about those states - you</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.670" end="00:49:32.470" style="s2">know intentionally engineer materials</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.220" end="00:49:34.840" style="s2">that have properties that would not</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.470" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">otherwise be found in the types of</p>

<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">naturally settle within the physical</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.210" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">environment and so in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:47.830" style="s2">biological environment and the game</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">theoretic model one might look at those</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.830" end="00:49:55.349" style="s2">as also potentially categorized by a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:57.550" style="s2">smaller subset of low-resolution</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.550" end="00:50:00.760" style="s2">rule-based categories I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.440" end="00:50:03.460" style="s2">might map towards something like you</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.760" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">know Stephen Wolfram&#39;s mapping of a new</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.460" end="00:50:07.410" style="s2">kind of science and like when he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">draws like what is it three or four</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.410" end="00:50:13.300" style="s2">families of these types of identic</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:15.099" style="s2">systems just from basic rule sets but</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.300" end="00:50:16.510" style="s2">that being said we obviously know that</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.099" end="00:50:18.490" style="s2">within complex systems there are all</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.510" end="00:50:21.609" style="s2">sorts of other attractor states there</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.490" end="00:50:26.830" style="s2">are all sorts of other ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.609" end="00:50:28.330" style="s2">stabilize local complexity and so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.830" end="00:50:31.030" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know as much about is</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.330" end="00:50:32.920" style="s2">how to again so so that would map to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.030" end="00:50:35.170" style="s2">idea of discovering new forms many other</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.920" end="00:50:38.550" style="s2">exotic forms of matter would be actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.170" end="00:50:41.080" style="s2">mapping many other stable attractors of</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.550" end="00:50:42.910" style="s2">behavioral space right but then what</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.080" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to learn is the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.910" end="00:50:47.260" style="s2">of creating the metamaterials of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">attractors in terms of intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.260" end="00:50:51.700" style="s2">taking the reigns of creating stable</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">complexity with new properties that</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.700" end="00:50:55.900" style="s2">might yeah actually settled otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:57.369" style="s2">right leg size right perfect yes I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.900" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">hold that now do this thing will you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.369" end="00:51:00.790" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">drill-down so imagine that you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.790" end="00:51:08.430" style="s2">your ability to melt is increasing in</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:11.260" style="s2">intensity so you pout you power through</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.430" end="00:51:13.870" style="s2">chemistry and you&#39;re now operating at</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.260" end="00:51:16.660" style="s2">the level of physics and then you power</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.870" end="00:51:19.170" style="s2">through physics now you&#39;re operating at</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.660" end="00:51:21.660" style="s2">the level of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.170" end="00:51:26.520" style="s2">that thing which gives rise to physics</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.660" end="00:51:28.109" style="s2">yeah of which mathematics is a piece or</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.520" end="00:51:29.609" style="s2">actually it&#39;s the generator function</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.109" end="00:51:30.900" style="s2">from which mathematics comes as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.609" end="00:51:32.940" style="s2">out with mathematics and physics are</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.900" end="00:51:34.859" style="s2">actually peers and there&#39;s a generator</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.940" end="00:51:36.900" style="s2">function that lies below both of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.859" end="00:51:39.510" style="s2">this apology is the kiss that is is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.900" end="00:51:41.369" style="s2">closer you can actually do topology in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.510" end="00:51:44.849" style="s2">both mathematics and physics so now</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.369" end="00:51:47.730" style="s2">we&#39;re at the level of topology you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.849" end="00:51:49.799" style="s2">actually go lower than that two levels</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.730" end="00:51:53.250" style="s2">and that&#39;s as far as it appears that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.799" end="00:51:54.210" style="s2">actually can go what would you what</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.250" end="00:51:57.349" style="s2">would you characterize is two levels</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.210" end="00:52:01.619" style="s2">deeper than topology just so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.349" end="00:52:04.710" style="s2">I it we could go there but that requires</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.619" end="00:52:05.849" style="s2">that we actually do that work okay the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.710" end="00:52:08.390" style="s2">only thing I can do is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.849" end="00:52:08.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.110" end="00:52:17.260" style="s2">a a self reifying self-generating</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.420" end="00:52:26.620" style="s2">structure that language right there when</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.610" end="00:52:28.360" style="s2">I pause before structure the word</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.620" end="00:52:30.690" style="s2">structure is a pointer not an actual</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.360" end="00:52:30.690" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.930" end="00:52:37.090" style="s2">you know the metaphysical or Boros yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.450" end="00:52:40.360" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s a if so we could just</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.090" end="00:52:42.040" style="s2">the topology below topology you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.360" end="00:52:44.770" style="s2">going to be dealing with the partition</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.040" end="00:52:45.970" style="s2">between ontology and epistemology as it</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.770" end="00:52:47.590" style="s2">turns out there&#39;s six distinct things</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.970" end="00:52:51.850" style="s2">that lay a deficit in that partition</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.590" end="00:52:53.560" style="s2">ethics aesthetics ontology epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.850" end="00:52:55.750" style="s2">I can remember the two right now okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.560" end="00:52:58.900" style="s2">then there&#39;s one layer below that which</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.750" end="00:53:01.240" style="s2">is the metaphysical Ouroboros the form</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.900" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">the place from which ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.240" end="00:53:09.369" style="s2">epistemology collapse into a singularity</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:12.500" style="s2">but nonetheless actually has a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.369" end="00:53:14.050" style="s2">Dynamis associated with it yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.500" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">actually the location from which</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.050" end="00:53:25.670" style="s2">structure being and dynamics is</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:27.050" style="s2">omnipresent in a unity sure okay I just</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.670" end="00:53:30.350" style="s2">wrote a short poem about this last night</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.050" end="00:53:31.190" style="s2">actually it&#39;s funny no godly enough I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.350" end="00:53:33.170" style="s2">send it over to you after the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.190" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">conversation nice one but I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.170" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">introduce you to the guy who actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:42.320" style="s2">did that primary work kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:46.250" style="s2">lowest point in deep code that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.320" end="00:53:47.600" style="s2">gonna be a that&#39;s gonna be awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.250" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">and he&#39;ll be very happy you don&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.600" end="00:53:51.170" style="s2">only has like five people he can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:54.369" style="s2">so having people he can talk to is one</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.170" end="00:53:57.830" style="s2">of the biggest gifts that we give him</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.369" end="00:53:59.060" style="s2">yeah so I mean it truly is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.830" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">communicate about these types of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.060" end="00:54:05.270" style="s2">and actually show oh God the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:06.890" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a beautiful thing he may</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.270" end="00:54:10.280" style="s2">actually start crying by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.890" end="00:54:11.850" style="s2">that&#39;s great it&#39;s beautiful so so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.280" end="00:54:14.730" style="s2">point is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.850" end="00:54:16.710" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to be building anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.730" end="00:54:19.890" style="s2">in an environment that has that level of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.710" end="00:54:24.450" style="s2">potential intensity if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.890" end="00:54:25.500" style="s2">care to identify in very talk with</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.450" end="00:54:27.990" style="s2">metamaterials like if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.500" end="00:54:29.100" style="s2">actually build metamaterials you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.990" end="00:54:30.360" style="s2">going to be half of it you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.100" end="00:54:33.390" style="s2">be having to operate at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.360" end="00:54:36.330" style="s2">topology at a minimum and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.390" end="00:54:39.210" style="s2">that in the in the you know and under</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.330" end="00:54:40.170" style="s2">exponential we get past topology</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.210" end="00:54:43.500" style="s2">actually pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.170" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">and maybe you like 2845 so we really</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.500" end="00:54:46.470" style="s2">have to actually go all the way down now</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:47.640" style="s2">the beautiful part is that it appears to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.470" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">be the case that when you get all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.640" end="00:54:52.410" style="s2">way down to the metaphysical Ouroboros</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:53.670" style="s2">the question of intensity breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.410" end="00:54:58.650" style="s2">that you&#39;re actually now at a level</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.670" end="00:55:02.610" style="s2">below concepts like force and and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.650" end="00:55:05.460" style="s2">change and so by definition force and</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.609" end="00:55:42.090" style="s2">falling out of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.530" end="00:55:52.470" style="s2">the ability to continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.690" end="00:55:54.450" style="s2">so in a simulation its conception is</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.470" end="00:55:56.670" style="s2">that something like me the information</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.450" end="00:55:59.010" style="s2">theoretic bedrock then from which all</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.670" end="00:56:03.320" style="s2">emerges yeah from your &#39;cimmanon</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.010" end="00:56:05.720" style="s2">perspective did that would be it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.320" end="00:56:07.880" style="s2">and so the interesting question then</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.720" end="00:56:10.280" style="s2">becomes you know how do we you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.880" end="00:56:13.390" style="s2">other than other than conceptually if</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.280" end="00:56:16.390" style="s2">it&#39;s beyond the domain of empirical</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.390" end="00:56:16.390" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.619" end="00:56:21.609" style="s2">it becomes rather different it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.869" end="00:56:23.470" style="s2">rather difficult to develop those types</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.609" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">of maps and develop an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.470" end="00:56:27.490" style="s2">if it&#39;s beyond dynamics if it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:29.740" style="s2">encoding and it&#39;s not empirically</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.490" end="00:56:32.380" style="s2">identifiable encoding you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.740" end="00:56:34.630" style="s2">working with reverberations only at</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.380" end="00:56:38.700" style="s2">these higher levels right the the Pat</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.630" end="00:56:42.249" style="s2">the the invariant the emergent invariant</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.700" end="00:56:44.650" style="s2">patterns of the reverberations and</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.249" end="00:56:46.599" style="s2">trying to work backwards if it let me up</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.650" end="00:56:48.809" style="s2">let me do this we can actually get a</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.599" end="00:56:52.749" style="s2">look this is actually a helpful tool</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.809" end="00:56:55.480" style="s2">empirical is actually a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.749" end="00:56:57.430" style="s2">concept leaking there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.480" end="00:57:00.700" style="s2">something that is more basic than</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.430" end="00:57:02.619" style="s2">empirical that we can actually use so</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.700" end="00:57:04.029" style="s2">we&#39;re we actually where we actually end</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.619" end="00:57:08.279" style="s2">up doing as we so we recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.029" end="00:57:11.769" style="s2">empirical ends up being first-person</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.279" end="00:57:14.650" style="s2">mm-hmm all right so it&#39;s the the binding</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.769" end="00:57:16.930" style="s2">at first person which is differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.650" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">from the binding at third person mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.930" end="00:57:21.490" style="s2">and by the way which is differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:24.190" style="s2">from the binding at that thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.490" end="00:57:26.739" style="s2">both and neither first and third person</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.190" end="00:57:29.319" style="s2">and it turns out you now have closure</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.739" end="00:57:32.920" style="s2">those are it that&#39;s that&#39;s the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.319" end="00:57:35.319" style="s2">level basis at which you can have so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.920" end="00:57:37.420" style="s2">can do and muscle use is divided between</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.319" end="00:57:40.749" style="s2">first and third person or the the but a</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.420" end="00:57:42.549" style="s2">state of ambiguity between first and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.749" end="00:57:44.019" style="s2">third person that is that closure or</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.549" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">that is that that ability to feed back</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.019" end="00:57:48.130" style="s2">upon itself is that the coherence</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:49.660" style="s2">binding is that what you&#39;re going there</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.130" end="00:57:53.769" style="s2">or is that what you&#39;re is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.660" end="00:57:58.749" style="s2">actually okay that is exactly it is and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.769" end="00:58:00.759" style="s2">so I mean fortunately we can do that so</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.749" end="00:58:03.489" style="s2">so the thing that you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.759" end="00:58:05.319" style="s2">under the heading of empiricism you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.489" end="00:58:07.660" style="s2">still look for under the heading of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.319" end="00:58:09.099" style="s2">first-person if there&#39;s actually a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.660" end="00:58:10.299" style="s2">fundamental way of articulating that</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.099" end="00:58:12.190" style="s2">first-person is just a useful metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.299" end="00:58:13.329" style="s2">you can get lost if you actually stick</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.190" end="00:58:16.269" style="s2">in that metaphor you find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.329" end="00:58:18.339" style="s2">becoming a Buddhist which isn&#39;t which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.269" end="00:58:19.480" style="s2">a bad it&#39;s useful no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.339" end="00:58:23.440" style="s2">where it&#39;s nothing it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.480" end="00:58:24.999" style="s2">everything we need right now and you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.440" end="00:58:28.089" style="s2">get lost there but the idea is that if</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.999" end="00:58:31.089" style="s2">you if you recognize the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.089" end="00:58:33.609" style="s2">having a simultaneity or a trial to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.089" end="00:58:35.769" style="s2">Naji of what we can call first person</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.609" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">and third person and the binding between</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.769" end="00:58:39.249" style="s2">first and third person it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:42.579" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s an aunt that third</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.249" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough by itself we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.579" end="00:58:48.819" style="s2">able to have all three simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:52.029" style="s2">then you have the checksum that science</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.819" end="00:58:53.829" style="s2">has been able to get via what we call</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.029" end="00:58:57.460" style="s2">become an H between math and empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.829" end="00:59:02.109" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a more basic and</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.460" end="00:59:04.989" style="s2">foundational expression of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.109" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">insight that gave rise to the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.989" end="00:59:09.170" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:12.670" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.170" end="00:59:12.670" style="s2">whoo that was heavy um</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.770" end="00:59:18.340" style="s2">and you ever done like I&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.900" end="00:59:20.910" style="s2">done some variation I&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.340" end="00:59:20.910" style="s2">juggling</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.979" end="00:59:26.930" style="s2">metaphorical juggling no no actual</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.420" end="00:59:29.150" style="s2">physical drug line I have I have it you</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.930" end="00:59:31.309" style="s2">know I&#39;ve gotten to a very very basic</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.150" end="00:59:33.289" style="s2">level being able to do it but not having</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.309" end="00:59:35.390" style="s2">practice it regularly it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.289" end="00:59:37.759" style="s2">that I can&#39;t just pick up tightrope</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.390" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">walking and love on time abroad you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.759" end="00:59:42.109" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">so the you may have some example of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.109" end="00:59:47.299" style="s2">I&#39;ve slackline a bit Lachlan okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:49.849" style="s2">experience is just a circumstance like</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.299" end="00:59:52.670" style="s2">that where you are very much walking on</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.849" end="00:59:55.779" style="s2">something where you are at the limits of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.670" end="00:59:59.180" style="s2">your ability to be there yep but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.779" end="01:00:00.890" style="s2">indifferent could be there any any</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.180" end="01:00:03.109" style="s2">number of embodied experiences are of</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.890" end="01:00:06.619" style="s2">that sort that&#39;s how I just felt like I</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.109" end="01:00:08.150" style="s2">was actually like the petering on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.619" end="01:00:09.079" style="s2">edge but trying to hold it in place and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.150" end="01:00:11.989" style="s2">get into the other side and like</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.079" end="01:00:15.109" style="s2">touching the tree yeah I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.989" end="01:00:16.730" style="s2">beautiful thing right I mean it is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.109" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">I think it&#39;s expressed quite clearly</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.730" end="01:00:20.390" style="s2">people like Peterson talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.579" style="s2">explicitly as well in terms of and this</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.390" end="01:00:24.980" style="s2">is why we watch sports this is why we</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.579" end="01:00:27.589" style="s2">watch yeah this is this is why we watch</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.980" end="01:00:29.210" style="s2">you know those who have practiced or</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.589" end="01:00:33.019" style="s2">those who have gone to the limits of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.210" end="01:00:35.660" style="s2">known capacities act out the limits of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.019" end="01:00:37.279" style="s2">their own capacities for all others to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.660" end="01:00:39.769" style="s2">you know appreciate or potentially try</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.279" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">to emulate and it is a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.769" end="01:00:46.849" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s quite powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:48.170" style="s2">oh speaking of tithing so what I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.849" end="01:00:49.220" style="s2">do is I&#39;m gonna do to interrupt I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.170" end="01:00:50.359" style="s2">gonna hand the ball back to you to</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.220" end="01:00:53.150" style="s2">finish what you&#39;re just saying but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.359" end="01:00:54.259" style="s2">like to introduce before we what is your</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.150" end="01:00:57.019" style="s2">heart stop by the way I do have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.259" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">probably 30 minutes um I got to get to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.019" end="01:01:01.039" style="s2">something at noon and I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:03.559" style="s2">pressing it too hard sure I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.039" end="01:01:05.869" style="s2">loop into pragmatics like what exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.559" end="01:01:07.849" style="s2">tactically or materially are you up to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.869" end="01:01:11.529" style="s2">and or what would be the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.849" end="01:01:14.749" style="s2">way for us to develop this relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.529" end="01:01:18.619" style="s2">but yeah so I&#39;m gonna put that on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.749" end="01:01:20.299" style="s2">stack high-ropes okay yeah the tires</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.619" end="01:01:21.980" style="s2">concept is something that&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.299" end="01:01:24.829" style="s2">little bit I&#39;ve been thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.980" end="01:01:28.849" style="s2">through the lens of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.829" end="01:01:33.950" style="s2">metaphor of what we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.849" end="01:01:38.520" style="s2">the schism between the perception of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.950" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">stability and the reality of extreme</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.520" end="01:01:44.339" style="s2">contingency if that makes sense so you</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:47.000" style="s2">know in our in our everyday life we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.339" end="01:01:49.260" style="s2">I kind of like to look at it as</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.000" end="01:01:52.280" style="s2">evolution and the processes that have</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.260" end="01:01:55.770" style="s2">given rise to us have given us this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.280" end="01:01:58.730" style="s2">powerful gyroscope that we carry with us</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.770" end="01:02:01.430" style="s2">as we walk upon this tightrope</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.730" end="01:02:04.190" style="s2">and we don&#39;t realize that we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.430" end="01:02:07.490" style="s2">tight way above a 10,000 foot chasm</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.190" end="01:02:10.460" style="s2">because the gyroscope is so finely tuned</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.490" end="01:02:11.960" style="s2">mm-hmm but you know it doesn&#39;t take much</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.460" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">in terms of you know if you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.960" end="01:02:14.930" style="s2">to go there and this is one reason why I</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:17.950" style="s2">think people have such profound</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.930" end="01:02:22.100" style="s2">experiences with psychedelics because</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.950" end="01:02:24.980" style="s2">that is one way of observing just how</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.100" end="01:02:28.250" style="s2">easily the system can be perturbed and</p>

<p begin="01:02:28.250" end="01:02:33.650" style="s2">that entails from even slight</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.100" end="01:02:35.660" style="s2">distortions of that gyroscopic</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.650" end="01:02:37.790" style="s2">stabilization and so it&#39;s almost kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.660" end="01:02:40.220" style="s2">like you know you&#39;ll have these moments</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.790" end="01:02:42.530" style="s2">and the reason I kind of like to think</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.220" end="01:02:44.780" style="s2">about that through the individual lens</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.530" end="01:02:47.030" style="s2">because I also think society is starting</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.780" end="01:02:48.410" style="s2">to have these moments where we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.030" end="01:02:48.800" style="s2">tightrope we don&#39;t realize we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.410" end="01:02:50.690" style="s2">tightrope</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.800" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">but the gyroscope is starting to glitch</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.690" end="01:02:56.150" style="s2">out right and it glitches out it stops</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:58.940" style="s2">working momentarily we get this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.150" end="01:03:00.230" style="s2">you know extreme dizziness or or fear or</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.940" end="01:03:01.970" style="s2">fear of heights in terms of like</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.230" end="01:03:04.580" style="s2">starting to realize just how deep the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.970" end="01:03:07.190" style="s2">chasm needs to this is if the gyroscope</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.580" end="01:03:09.550" style="s2">were to begin malfunctioning in a way</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.190" end="01:03:12.050" style="s2">that is more chaotic than it already is</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.550" end="01:03:13.460" style="s2">is trending towards and yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.050" end="01:03:16.130" style="s2">kind of look at like Trump like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.460" end="01:03:19.100" style="s2">Trump is this glitch in the gyroscopic</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.130" end="01:03:21.380" style="s2">stabilization mechanism yeah it&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.100" end="01:03:24.770" style="s2">some people extreme panic reactions to</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.380" end="01:03:31.580" style="s2">the realization of just how fragile a</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.770" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">system just how fret just how fragile</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.580" end="01:03:43.420" style="s2">reality can become if certain if certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:44.770" style="s2">assumptions are violated repeatedly and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.420" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">we push over one of those those</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.770" end="01:03:47.740" style="s2">thresholds like in the same kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:49.060" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about the complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.740" end="01:03:51.340" style="s2">system of the climate environment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.060" end="01:03:54.040" style="s2">like you know you start bumping up</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.340" end="01:03:55.660" style="s2">against these thresholds and even though</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.040" end="01:03:57.460" style="s2">all behavior before that was was</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.660" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2">relatively linear and maps pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.460" end="01:04:02.050" style="s2">to human intuition and we could tell</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:03.250" style="s2">this linear story of history when you</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.050" end="01:04:06.340" style="s2">start bumping up against a phase</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.250" end="01:04:09.100" style="s2">transition or a potential bifurcation</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.340" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">point things stop making sense in any</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.100" end="01:04:14.830" style="s2">type of linear narrative and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">when that happens you know then the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.830" end="01:04:20.830" style="s2">bifurcation point is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:23.020" style="s2">left or right looking down over the over</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.830" end="01:04:24.940" style="s2">the over the wire and thousand feet down</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.020" end="01:04:28.600" style="s2">you know and Mike you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.940" end="01:04:30.250" style="s2">necessarily put all off on either side</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.600" end="01:04:32.920" style="s2">and the question becomes how do you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.250" end="01:04:36.370" style="s2">maintain the illusion of of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.920" end="01:04:37.930" style="s2">narrative or even then they&#39;re to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.370" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">how do you maintain linearity or at</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.930" end="01:04:42.790" style="s2">least some sort of coherence the word</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:44.140" style="s2">some sort of coherence and in this case</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.790" end="01:04:46.510" style="s2">I&#39;m going to put sovereignty back into</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.140" end="01:04:49.540" style="s2">the end of the vocabulary it&#39;s how do</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.510" end="01:04:51.460" style="s2">you maintain sovereignty so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.540" end="01:04:52.600" style="s2">couple there&#39;s like I think three</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.460" end="01:04:56.740" style="s2">distinct things here they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.600" end="01:04:58.900" style="s2">separate and interesting the one is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.740" end="01:05:00.550" style="s2">gyroscope and what I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.900" end="01:05:01.930" style="s2">about so I&#39;m gonna talk about that using</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.550" end="01:05:07.690" style="s2">the language you used or we used earlier</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.930" end="01:05:13.690" style="s2">in terms of this unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.690" end="01:05:15.490" style="s2">intelligence or stack okay so and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.690" end="01:05:16.200" style="s2">walking on a tightrope is perfect I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.490" end="01:05:21.160" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.200" end="01:05:22.150" style="s2">a one-year-old can&#39;t walk on a floor</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.160" end="01:05:23.740" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.150" end="01:05:25.690" style="s2">that&#39;s the beginning of the stack is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.740" end="01:05:28.150" style="s2">actual building of the capacity to walk</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.690" end="01:05:31.540" style="s2">balance awareness perception can the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.150" end="01:05:33.010" style="s2">kinesthetics by the time you get to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.540" end="01:05:35.320" style="s2">point where you&#39;re capable of walking on</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.010" end="01:05:36.940" style="s2">a tightrope all of that is being</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.320" end="01:05:38.920" style="s2">run in the unconscious meaning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.940" end="01:05:40.350" style="s2">being run in a domain of intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.920" end="01:05:42.970" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to have any</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.350" end="01:05:44.630" style="s2">conscious control over at all so you end</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.970" end="01:05:46.790" style="s2">up having this</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.630" end="01:05:48.530" style="s2">your significant gigantic intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.790" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">that is acting as an unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.530" end="01:05:54.660" style="s2">gyroscope that your conscious volition</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:58.910" style="s2">and perception</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.660" end="01:06:05.090" style="s2">which is itself miniscule relies on</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.910" end="01:06:07.320" style="s2">mm-hmm right now there&#39;s another aspect</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.090" end="01:06:10.200" style="s2">to the degree which that is entirely</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.320" end="01:06:13.140" style="s2">unconscious and your consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.200" end="01:06:15.260" style="s2">becomes aware of the vastness of that</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.140" end="01:06:18.030" style="s2">for which it is in fact responsible if</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.260" end="01:06:22.170" style="s2">it forgets that it&#39;s not responsible</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.030" end="01:06:24.119" style="s2">then it gets terrified once this is this</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.170" end="01:06:25.560" style="s2">is the you look when you&#39;re rock</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.119" end="01:06:26.910" style="s2">climbing and you look down or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.560" end="01:06:28.170" style="s2">walking the tightrope and you suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.910" end="01:06:30.210" style="s2">become aware of the fact you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.170" end="01:06:32.730" style="s2">on the tightrope consciousness takes</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.210" end="01:06:34.800" style="s2">itself as taking responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.730" end="01:06:37.619" style="s2">vastness of the thing it&#39;s trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.800" end="01:06:42.510" style="s2">ie losing track of the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.619" end="01:06:44.970" style="s2">just the tiniest trim tab on top of a by</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.510" end="01:06:47.340" style="s2">definition equivalently vast capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.970" end="01:06:49.560" style="s2">otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be even in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.340" end="01:06:51.570" style="s2">position of tightrope walking then it</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.560" end="01:06:53.340" style="s2">falls into immediate overwhelmed now</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.570" end="01:06:55.860" style="s2">this is a serious problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.340" end="01:06:58.830" style="s2">because if it to overwhelm then the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.860" end="01:07:01.710" style="s2">third characteristic arises which is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.830" end="01:07:06.470" style="s2">well functioning of this stack of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.710" end="01:07:06.470" style="s2">gyroscope is itself very</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.180" end="01:07:14.470" style="s2">delicate and so yet and as consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.250" end="01:07:16.510" style="s2">falls into some form of overwhelm we can</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.470" end="01:07:19.960" style="s2">do this very neurologically if you get</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.510" end="01:07:22.420" style="s2">scared then actually the neurological is</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.960" end="01:07:24.520" style="s2">very very easy right if your if your</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.420" end="01:07:27.220" style="s2">prefrontal cortex begins the process of</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.520" end="01:07:28.660" style="s2">telling a story that indicates that the</p>

<p begin="01:07:28.660" end="01:07:34.120" style="s2">though poetically overwhelming then</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.930" end="01:07:36.220" style="s2">paradoxically your adrenal system will</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.120" end="01:07:38.620" style="s2">actually respond to that story as if</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.220" end="01:07:40.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a real phenomenon and kick your</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.570" end="01:07:44.170" style="s2">amygdala hijack which are actually</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:57.910" style="s2">full stop and so you end up with this</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.600" end="01:07:59.290" style="s2">really interesting problem that and this</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.910" end="01:08:00.670" style="s2">I think is the reason why I&#39;ve actually</p>

<p begin="01:09:25.510" end="01:09:29.720" style="s2">of being on social media yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.670" end="01:09:31.310" style="s2">that&#39;s dead right</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.720" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">but just that the at the collective</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.310" end="01:09:35.120" style="s2">scale of the collective organism acting</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.960" end="01:09:40.580" style="s2">in that way that&#39;s really neat so the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.120" end="01:09:41.990" style="s2">implication would be that ha that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.580" end="01:09:44.930" style="s2">really interesting I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.990" end="01:09:48.190" style="s2">actually awesomely right so so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.930" end="01:09:48.190" style="s2">the way it&#39;s feeling to me</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.569" end="01:09:54.079" style="s2">using tightrope-walking as the metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.630" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of having an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.079" end="01:10:01.210" style="s2">I&#39;m going to say consciousness that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:06.219" style="s2">allows you to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.210" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">aware of in the right way the modalities</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.219" end="01:10:11.020" style="s2">of intelligence that are in fact</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:12.760" style="s2">adequate to and responsible for things</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.020" end="01:10:17.890" style="s2">like walking</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.760" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">okay but without doing this state shift</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.890" end="01:10:25.450" style="s2">where you&#39;re pulling responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:27.670" style="s2">agency for that capacity out of those</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.450" end="01:10:29.350" style="s2">domains and into some other domains for</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.670" end="01:10:31.870" style="s2">which that isn&#39;t possible</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.350" end="01:10:33.910" style="s2">and so the walking along the tightrope</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.870" end="01:10:35.590" style="s2">you suddenly try to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.910" end="01:10:36.760" style="s2">for controlling your balance running it</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.590" end="01:10:39.190" style="s2">in consciousness which is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.760" end="01:10:43.150" style="s2">terrible idea yeah but if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.190" end="01:10:44.590" style="s2">you&#39;re really really self-aware like you</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.150" end="01:10:46.780" style="s2">could do it right now I got yeah I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.590" end="01:10:48.850" style="s2">can stand on one foot and you can notice</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.780" end="01:10:50.410" style="s2">that yeah what&#39;s going on like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.850" end="01:10:52.360" style="s2">standing on one foot holding the laptop</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.410" end="01:10:54.670" style="s2">in one hand and balancing if I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.360" end="01:10:56.260" style="s2">like listening very closely I can be</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.670" end="01:10:58.060" style="s2">aware of the fact there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.260" end="01:11:00.640" style="s2">intelligence that&#39;s taking care of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.060" end="01:11:02.350" style="s2">I can notice it the more I try to pay</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.640" end="01:11:04.270" style="s2">attention to where my balance is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.350" end="01:11:06.940" style="s2">less balance I have is harder because</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.270" end="01:11:09.070" style="s2">I&#39;m somehow I&#39;m changing the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.940" end="01:11:11.440" style="s2">flow and putting the sort of the shape</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.070" end="01:11:13.600" style="s2">of that intelligence out of sphere yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.440" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">I can still notice it and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.600" end="01:11:16.950" style="s2">where it is right but here&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:19.690" style="s2">thing all right so given that metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.950" end="01:11:20.950" style="s2">that sphere of meta solvent we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.690" end="01:11:23.350" style="s2">talking about these layers of viscosity</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.950" end="01:11:25.000" style="s2">all the way down to the deep code there</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.350" end="01:11:28.210" style="s2">is a mode of intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.000" end="01:11:30.190" style="s2">operating at that level already our job</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.210" end="01:11:33.940" style="s2">is to actually be able to be present to</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.190" end="01:11:36.820" style="s2">a kind of being aware that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.940" end="01:11:38.950" style="s2">give that intelligence the space and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.820" end="01:11:40.840" style="s2">integration that it needs to surface and</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.950" end="01:11:43.120" style="s2">do the work that it needs to do mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.840" end="01:11:44.889" style="s2">meaning we cannot operate at the level</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.120" end="01:11:47.260" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.889" end="01:11:50.229" style="s2">consciousness and intelligence that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.260" end="01:11:52.959" style="s2">use at the surface mm-hmm and try to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.229" end="01:11:55.689" style="s2">the work at the base mm-hmm like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.959" end="01:11:58.479" style="s2">good just to extend your your metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.689" end="01:12:04.149" style="s2">in terms of the balancing metaphor and</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.479" end="01:12:05.889" style="s2">the trying to tune into that so I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.149" end="01:12:07.659" style="s2">the way that I kind of look at this as</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.889" end="01:12:09.340" style="s2">well going all the way back to the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.659" end="01:12:11.860" style="s2">kind of recursive T&#39;Pol topological</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.340" end="01:12:13.689" style="s2">stack there&#39;s this all these processes</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.860" end="01:12:16.510" style="s2">dynamic processes going on deep within</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.689" end="01:12:19.989" style="s2">the stack and they&#39;re sending signals up</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.510" end="01:12:22.229" style="s2">the stack that are often in no way</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.989" end="01:12:25.269" style="s2">listened to by the conscious mind and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.229" end="01:12:27.099" style="s2">especially not they&#39;re there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.269" end="01:12:29.889" style="s2">there not only are they not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.099" end="01:12:31.809" style="s2">listen to or tapped into consciously but</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.889" end="01:12:33.999" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting at is that if you do</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.809" end="01:12:37.179" style="s2">try to listen to them and then take</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.999" end="01:12:41.439" style="s2">control without having developed an ear</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.179" end="01:12:44.559" style="s2">for them perhaps the interaction can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.439" end="01:12:47.579" style="s2">quite dizzying literally yep</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.559" end="01:12:50.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.579" end="01:12:52.139" style="s2">those who have those who have attempted</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.549" end="01:12:54.539" style="s2">yoga for the first time might be</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.139" end="01:12:57.089" style="s2">familiar with these types of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.539" end="01:13:00.920" style="s2">moments where you put yourself in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.089" end="01:13:06.440" style="s2">position where you are now</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.920" end="01:13:11.570" style="s2">forced to realize that the natural modes</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.440" end="01:13:14.389" style="s2">of balance that that control habituated</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.570" end="01:13:17.449" style="s2">processes are operating beyond their</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.389" end="01:13:19.929" style="s2">limitations mm-hmm and therefore your</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.449" end="01:13:23.320" style="s2">conscious mind engages to try to correct</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.929" end="01:13:26.630" style="s2">yet if you have not developed the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.320" end="01:13:29.810" style="s2">grammatical capacity to interact with</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.630" end="01:13:32.659" style="s2">those structures those emergent</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.810" end="01:13:34.940" style="s2">structures and and and parameterize them</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.659" end="01:13:37.480" style="s2">with the appropriately subtle touch to</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.940" end="01:13:40.340" style="s2">exert appropriately subtle top-down</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.480" end="01:13:43.340" style="s2">parameterization your going to fall and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.340" end="01:13:46.550" style="s2">becoming you know rehabilitate that</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.340" end="01:13:50.389" style="s2">behavior becomes a process of actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.550" end="01:13:51.679" style="s2">developing mathematical capacity um if</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.389" end="01:13:53.480" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.679" end="01:13:56.090" style="s2">absolutely yeah that made a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.480" end="01:13:58.820" style="s2">that was a very different set of words</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.090" end="01:14:01.080" style="s2">that I refused but I get it that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.820" end="01:14:02.220" style="s2">very well done</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.080" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s neat that&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.220" end="01:14:07.910" style="s2">inspiring that I feel like I have a much</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:07.910" style="s2">better handle on</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:13.330" style="s2">what&#39;s happening it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.290" end="01:14:17.050" style="s2">so this will I think this will actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.330" end="01:14:20.140" style="s2">end up generally showing up as spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.050" end="01:14:23.260" style="s2">to most people mm-hmm you know it is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.140" end="01:14:26.410" style="s2">the embodied reality of collective</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.260" end="01:14:28.210" style="s2">intelligence mm-hmm that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.410" end="01:14:30.370" style="s2">really interesting concept I think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.210" end="01:14:32.830" style="s2">is a we were I think we&#39;re actually like</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.370" end="01:14:35.200" style="s2">ironically on Twitter and this is I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.830" end="01:14:39.940" style="s2">meta ironic I even mentioned Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.200" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">right now um but you know sort of ik the</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.940" end="01:14:45.940" style="s2">kind of conservative voice who you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.840" end="01:14:49.930" style="s2">take him for what you will but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.940" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">recently I think struck a chord of panic</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.930" end="01:14:55.180" style="s2">with his followers because he&#39;s begun</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:56.680" style="s2">speaking and otherwise spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.180" end="01:14:58.900" style="s2">language or talking about things like</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.680" end="01:15:01.510" style="s2">energies we&#39;re talking about these types</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.900" end="01:15:05.610" style="s2">of shifts in the energy of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.510" end="01:15:09.730" style="s2">mmm he&#39;s speaking to a demographic who</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.610" end="01:15:12.450" style="s2">has very little likely has very little</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.730" end="01:15:15.130" style="s2">cultural immersion in those types of</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.450" end="01:15:17.080" style="s2">grammars and he&#39;s getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.130" end="01:15:18.580" style="s2">friction for that but I think that was</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.080" end="01:15:20.440" style="s2">just it there&#39;s a recent perception that</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.580" end="01:15:22.630" style="s2">I had that maps very well to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.440" end="01:15:25.870" style="s2">saying because I think some people are</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.630" end="01:15:28.960" style="s2">starting to perceive these patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.870" end="01:15:30.760" style="s2">coherence for these shifts in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.960" end="01:15:33.480" style="s2">collective intelligence and the only</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.760" end="01:15:33.480" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.969" end="01:15:39.720" style="s2">available to them is the spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.739" end="01:15:40.890" style="s2">language yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.720" end="01:15:42.270" style="s2">gonna be it&#39;s gonna be really</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.890" end="01:15:46.530" style="s2">interesting I actually it&#39;s kind of neat</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.270" end="01:15:48.510" style="s2">I like it and and I&#39;m intrigued I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.530" end="01:15:49.530" style="s2">actually gonna take an i I watch him and</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.510" end="01:15:50.640" style="s2">see if there&#39;s see what what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.530" end="01:15:54.210" style="s2">talking about because that also sounds</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.640" end="01:15:56.070" style="s2">fascinating it doesn&#39;t your tick you</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.210" end="01:15:57.720" style="s2">lating it is novel to me I didn&#39;t wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.070" end="01:16:01.739" style="s2">aware of it but it doesn&#39;t surprise me</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.720" end="01:16:03.420" style="s2">yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.739" end="01:16:07.320" style="s2">in just the same way that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.420" end="01:16:09.460" style="s2">and I are noticing that we have come to</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.320" end="01:16:15.100" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.460" end="01:16:18.070" style="s2">similar perceptions independently as far</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.100" end="01:16:21.700" style="s2">as we can tell as it depended as against</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.070" end="01:16:23.230" style="s2">the defendant suggest and of course is</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.700" end="01:16:25.240" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious what it would be the case</p>

<p begin="01:16:25.240" end="01:16:33.480" style="s2">which is awesome and so it sort of itch</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.750" end="01:16:35.890" style="s2">or any agent any human or any sentient</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.480" end="01:16:39.370" style="s2">endeavors to perceive reality and</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.890" end="01:16:42.930" style="s2">becomes capable of doing so which to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.370" end="01:16:46.150" style="s2">just constructs within themselves a</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.930" end="01:16:48.760" style="s2">integrated intelligence with this</p>

<p begin="01:16:55.270" end="01:16:58.150" style="s2">at a piece perceive reality and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.920" end="01:16:59.800" style="s2">give you the same reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.150" end="01:17:02.760" style="s2">actually like the most optimistic fat</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.800" end="01:17:02.760" style="s2">mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.880" end="01:17:08.070" style="s2">to the unavoidable optimism it is an</p>

<p begin="01:17:08.070" end="01:17:11.820" style="s2">than that yeah it&#39;s funny the good you</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.750" end="01:17:13.650" style="s2">could articulate the both the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.820" end="01:17:16.889" style="s2">problematic and the solution can</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.650" end="01:17:18.590" style="s2">actually be done pretty simply I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.889" end="01:17:22.500" style="s2">quite say it yet in a way that can be</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.590" end="01:17:24.060" style="s2">shared simply but it&#39;s you know not that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.500" end="01:17:25.320" style="s2">hard it&#39;s very similar to this notion</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.060" end="01:17:27.480" style="s2">this medical report or the tightrope</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.320" end="01:17:31.610" style="s2">walker or the metaphor of the addict to</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.480" end="01:17:36.870" style="s2">use use your near passage it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.610" end="01:17:37.860" style="s2">maybe three failure conditions identify</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.870" end="01:17:40.710" style="s2">that two other conditions</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.860" end="01:17:44.270" style="s2">remove the failure conditions and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.710" end="01:17:44.270" style="s2">you&#39;re fine like it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.370" end="01:17:49.810" style="s2">the process of creating the map to</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.710" end="01:17:54.840" style="s2">discover the simplicity happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.810" end="01:17:57.790" style="s2">quite complex yeah quite complex yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.840" end="01:18:00.460" style="s2">yeah we have just to be respectful your</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.790" end="01:18:02.650" style="s2">time we have about 13 minutes left so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.460" end="01:18:04.030" style="s2">know you may have wanted to go in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.650" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">particular direction to wrap things up</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.030" end="01:18:09.100" style="s2">we&#39;re saying yes there is a with the</p>

<p begin="01:18:12.910" end="01:18:20.100" style="s2">what are the things that you think might</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.340" end="01:18:23.560" style="s2">be able to help you flow more smoothly</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.100" end="01:18:26.790" style="s2">either by getting them out of the way or</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.560" end="01:18:31.080" style="s2">by bringing them into being</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.790" end="01:18:34.530" style="s2">mm-hmm whoo a lot of that depends on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.080" end="01:18:37.790" style="s2">level of resolution I think in my own</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.530" end="01:18:41.070" style="s2">personal life I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.790" end="01:18:45.480" style="s2">articulating the body of thoughts that</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.070" end="01:18:50.210" style="s2">have only existed within my own mind in</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.480" end="01:18:54.140" style="s2">a way that is that in a way that that</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.210" end="01:19:00.940" style="s2">can begin to create the archetypal or</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.140" end="01:19:00.940" style="s2">imagistic language that act as beacons</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.120" end="01:19:07.210" style="s2">to attract like-minded individuals in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:11.320" style="s2">manner that facilitates more</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.210" end="01:19:14.380" style="s2">conversation that gives rise itself to</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.320" end="01:19:15.580" style="s2">higher resolution images and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.380" end="01:19:17.650" style="s2">kind of look at it as like this this</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.580" end="01:19:21.310" style="s2">process of pointillism in which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.650" end="01:19:24.520" style="s2">trying to create the you know minimally</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.310" end="01:19:26.890" style="s2">viable or a pointillist image of minimal</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.520" end="01:19:28.990" style="s2">viable interest to those with whom I</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.890" end="01:19:30.520" style="s2">would resonate yep on these topics and</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.990" end="01:19:32.380" style="s2">then together we can start adding more</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.520" end="01:19:36.370" style="s2">points I&#39;ve been called the generative</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.380" end="01:19:38.050" style="s2">bat signaling yeah precisely exactly</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.370" end="01:19:40.120" style="s2">exactly so that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.050" end="01:19:42.010" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.120" end="01:19:44.940" style="s2">writing in the way that I&#39;m writing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.010" end="01:19:48.730" style="s2">starting to try to make some videos</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.940" end="01:19:50.140" style="s2">about these topics so that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.730" end="01:19:52.720" style="s2">personal development level and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.140" end="01:19:53.710" style="s2">build the kind of trying to build the</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.720" end="01:19:56.980" style="s2">collective intelligence in my own</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.710" end="01:20:00.100" style="s2">personal life and identify and integrate</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.980" end="01:20:02.860" style="s2">into those networks within the world too</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.100" end="01:20:04.900" style="s2">because we are even if we are capable</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.860" end="01:20:07.150" style="s2">individuals we are but individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.900" end="01:20:09.010" style="s2">so plugging into those networks is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.150" end="01:20:11.050" style="s2">highly positive sum game that I would</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.010" end="01:20:14.140" style="s2">like to play yeah to the extent I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.050" end="01:20:16.240" style="s2">capable and so that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.140" end="01:20:19.270" style="s2">working on another part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.240" end="01:20:24.250" style="s2">working on is trying to take a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.270" end="01:20:26.380" style="s2">these ideas and map them onto a learning</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.250" end="01:20:28.640" style="s2">system actually create a mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.380" end="01:20:30.430" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.640" end="01:20:33.010" style="s2">with respect to the way that I</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.430" end="01:20:35.650" style="s2">envisioned</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.010" end="01:20:38.469" style="s2">modeling these dynamics topologically</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.650" end="01:20:42.780" style="s2">from an agent-based perspective I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.469" end="01:20:42.780" style="s2">if a tool like that could be created</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.150" end="01:20:46.989" style="s2">I mean that it&#39;s kind of like this this</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.800" end="01:20:49.570" style="s2">experimental map right like what is this</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.989" end="01:20:52.989" style="s2">experimental map of the game theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.570" end="01:20:54.760" style="s2">reality in which we exist how can we</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.989" end="01:20:56.770" style="s2">potentially start developing tools that</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.760" end="01:21:00.730" style="s2">allow us to begin weaving these meta</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.770" end="01:21:03.370" style="s2">materials with with tools other than</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.730" end="01:21:06.100" style="s2">just words because some extent our words</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.370" end="01:21:09.250" style="s2">are only so capable of expressing the</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.100" end="01:21:11.140" style="s2">nuance dynamics of what happens at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.250" end="01:21:12.730" style="s2">edges of these systems so I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.140" end="01:21:13.960" style="s2">in developing those types of models and</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.730" end="01:21:14.170" style="s2">working with anybody who&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.960" end="01:21:16.810" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.170" end="01:21:18.489" style="s2">great above that with respect to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.810" end="01:21:21.070" style="s2">paper that you&#39;ve been reading on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.489" end="01:21:25.199" style="s2">development of human value systems I am</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.070" end="01:21:28.810" style="s2">fascinated by the types of increased</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.199" end="01:21:34.090" style="s2">grammatical capacities opened to</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.810" end="01:21:35.679" style="s2">humanity by distributed systems of value</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.090" end="01:21:37.719" style="s2">representation and transaction that</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:39.699" style="s2">allow us to coordinate our trust and our</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.719" end="01:21:41.980" style="s2">interactions gained theoretically in</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.699" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">ways that are more sustainable and</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.980" end="01:21:47.860" style="s2">positive some so I think I kind of I</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:49.900" style="s2">look at this emerging submerging space</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.860" end="01:21:50.620" style="s2">of cryptocurrency or what presents</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.900" end="01:21:55.900" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.620" end="01:22:00.699" style="s2">first as cryptocurrency as the entree to</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.900" end="01:22:04.260" style="s2">a world of you know stable social</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.699" end="01:22:06.870" style="s2">metamaterials of value so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.260" end="01:22:12.870" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.870" end="01:22:15.860" style="s2">how to weave those</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.870" end="01:22:19.239" style="s2">pieces together with</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.860" end="01:22:22.809" style="s2">the notion of a collective so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.239" end="01:22:27.969" style="s2">of those who are interested in creating</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.809" end="01:22:33.110" style="s2">technologies or services that would</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.969" end="01:22:35.150" style="s2">coherently grow within the world and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.110" end="01:22:38.929" style="s2">kind of like a value generation engine</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.150" end="01:22:41.840" style="s2">is is one way of thinking about it bound</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.929" end="01:22:45.079" style="s2">with a coherent substructure of trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.840" end="01:22:47.900" style="s2">to understand and map out and distribute</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.079" end="01:22:49.520" style="s2">the value that flows into it so perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.900" end="01:22:50.690" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking in overly general terms now</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.520" end="01:22:52.909" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying to just kind of get this</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.690" end="01:22:55.040" style="s2">in in the last few minutes but you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.909" end="01:22:56.480" style="s2">I look at a lot of the the negative</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.040" end="01:22:59.780" style="s2">dynamics in terms of our current</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.480" end="01:23:01.730" style="s2">economic structures as emerging from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.780" end="01:23:03.440" style="s2">capital flows into the systems and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.730" end="01:23:07.699" style="s2">way that the capital flows into systems</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.440" end="01:23:09.770" style="s2">shift incentive structures so the</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.699" end="01:23:12.320" style="s2">particular like you know kind of flowing</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.770" end="01:23:14.270" style="s2">down a hill from high concentrations of</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.320" end="01:23:16.360" style="s2">capital to low concentrations of capital</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.270" end="01:23:19.280" style="s2">and then creating incentive structures</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.360" end="01:23:22.520" style="s2">largely predicated upon that is highly</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.280" end="01:23:25.699" style="s2">efficient in many ways but it also has</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.520" end="01:23:27.469" style="s2">its limitations and so we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.699" end="01:23:28.849" style="s2">experiment with now emergent</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.469" end="01:23:32.440" style="s2">collectively intelligent ways of</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.849" end="01:23:37.119" style="s2">allocating capital and and organizing</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.440" end="01:23:41.619" style="s2">creation in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.119" end="01:23:45.840" style="s2">that perhaps explore more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.619" end="01:23:47.940" style="s2">the value landscape of humanity that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.840" end="01:23:50.370" style="s2">being said they have their own attendant</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.940" end="01:23:53.040" style="s2">shortcomings and you know the ico the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.370" end="01:23:55.680" style="s2">first ICO wave was a demonstration of</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.040" end="01:23:57.090" style="s2">that and and so I&#39;m very interested in</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.680" end="01:24:00.810" style="s2">exploring this space in terms of how to</p>

<p begin="01:24:13.849" end="01:24:19.460" style="s2">healthy competition right so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.809" end="01:24:21.139" style="s2">of where I&#39;m at right now I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.460" end="01:24:23.420" style="s2">with some you know a few people to try</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.139" end="01:24:25.969" style="s2">to figure out what that would look like</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.420" end="01:24:27.500" style="s2">and how that would take how that would</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.969" end="01:24:29.480" style="s2">take form in terms of an actual platform</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.500" end="01:24:33.619" style="s2">I have some ideas that I&#39;ve been mapping</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.480" end="01:24:36.260" style="s2">out but yeah I haven&#39;t built it yet</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.619" end="01:24:39.349" style="s2">so there&#39;s so good so the shift to</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.260" end="01:24:40.489" style="s2">pragmatics I actually don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.349" end="01:24:42.980" style="s2">overwhelm so I&#39;m just gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.489" end="01:24:46.699" style="s2">surface these and reserve them for later</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.980" end="01:24:48.710" style="s2">later date but there&#39;s a group that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.699" end="01:24:53.119" style="s2">working with that is called the good</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.710" end="01:24:55.420" style="s2">money project that is how do I put this</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.119" end="01:24:55.420" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.510" end="01:25:03.810" style="s2">they have a nice high capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.599" end="01:25:07.920" style="s2">operational excellence and good intent</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.810" end="01:25:10.590" style="s2">and at least the ability to perceive the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.920" end="01:25:15.750" style="s2">value of more sophisticated approaches</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.590" end="01:25:19.440" style="s2">mm-hmm right so they have asked for deep</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.750" end="01:25:21.240" style="s2">code help in designing a it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.440" end="01:25:22.710" style="s2">kind of very simple their intent is to</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.240" end="01:25:28.560" style="s2">try to figure out how to actually create</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.710" end="01:25:31.820" style="s2">a intrinsically stable cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.560" end="01:25:36.440" style="s2">right nice desirable simple thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.820" end="01:25:39.410" style="s2">they&#39;re aware of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.440" end="01:25:42.440" style="s2">that is most interesting in the concept</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.410" end="01:25:47.469" style="s2">context of it being a potential</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.440" end="01:25:51.560" style="s2">strategic entree into a more</p>

<p begin="01:25:56.739" end="01:26:01.310" style="s2">currencies and I&#39;m using the word</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.760" end="01:26:04.280" style="s2">currency there to mean symbolic</p>

<p begin="01:26:05.570" end="01:26:10.580" style="s2">Santa Fe talk exactly yeah so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.110" end="01:26:12.380" style="s2">get to the point where they can actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.580" end="01:26:13.880" style="s2">listen to the Santa Fe talk and know</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.380" end="01:26:14.870" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about but they can get</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.880" end="01:26:17.350" style="s2">to the point where they can know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.870" end="01:26:19.930" style="s2">fact that that is something that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.350" end="01:26:21.250" style="s2">paying attention to mm-hmm and so as a</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.930" end="01:26:22.870" style="s2">consequence to come I interact with them</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.250" end="01:26:25.120" style="s2">at that at that interface layer where I</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.870" end="01:26:27.550" style="s2">endeavor to provide them something that</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.120" end="01:26:28.690" style="s2">they actually feel is the consensus</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.550" end="01:26:30.250" style="s2">valuable which is to say here&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.690" end="01:26:32.530" style="s2">actually design a metastable</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.250" end="01:26:34.150" style="s2">cryptocurrency that will work and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.530" end="01:26:35.650" style="s2">strategic approaches that will cause it</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.150" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">to disseminate out into the global</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.650" end="01:26:40.840" style="s2">environment with maximum integrity and</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:42.100" style="s2">velocity and by the way if by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.840" end="01:26:43.420" style="s2">doing this you&#39;ll give me permission to</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.100" end="01:26:44.860" style="s2">load a couple more things on it that are</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.420" end="01:26:46.120" style="s2">my own private stuff that you probably</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.860" end="01:26:47.530" style="s2">won&#39;t understand or value but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.120" end="01:26:49.270" style="s2">just gonna kind of give to me here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.530" end="01:26:51.070" style="s2">from build to the API and then when we</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.270" end="01:26:53.440" style="s2">get there we&#39;ll add that so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.070" end="01:26:57.540" style="s2">example there&#39;s another team that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.440" end="01:26:57.540" style="s2">building it&#39;s still in the crypto space</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.610" end="01:27:04.750" style="s2">they have partnered up with a group that</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.760" end="01:27:06.280" style="s2">build the largest scale a house are</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.750" end="01:27:09.730" style="s2">called high speed trading trading system</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.280" end="01:27:12.099" style="s2">in legacy finance well to build</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.730" end="01:27:13.330" style="s2">something like that in crypto I said</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.099" end="01:27:15.159" style="s2">this group has made it there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.330" end="01:27:17.380" style="s2">three three billionaires who built this</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.159" end="01:27:19.119" style="s2">system they left it there now entirely</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.380" end="01:27:21.940" style="s2">ego driven to try to build something</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.119" end="01:27:23.650" style="s2">that is super fun and cool in crypto the</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.940" end="01:27:25.239" style="s2">team that I&#39;m talking about was had</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.650" end="01:27:27.219" style="s2">already has already built kind of an AI</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.239" end="01:27:28.300" style="s2">infrastructure for doing that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.219" end="01:27:31.119" style="s2">really a very interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.300" end="01:27:35.340" style="s2">sophisticated adaptive AI infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.119" end="01:27:35.340" style="s2">with the intent of</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.240" end="01:27:42.070" style="s2">bridging exactly what you were just</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.830" end="01:27:43.570" style="s2">talking about so it&#39;s a collective</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.070" end="01:27:44.920" style="s2">intelligence resource allocation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.570" end="01:27:46.990" style="s2">that&#39;s where they&#39;re trying to get to</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.920" end="01:27:48.310" style="s2">this is part of the strategic vector so</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.990" end="01:27:50.440" style="s2">I&#39;m also working with them and helping</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.310" end="01:27:51.820" style="s2">them both strategically make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.440" end="01:27:52.870" style="s2">they&#39;re not making mistakes in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.820" end="01:27:56.050" style="s2">how they&#39;re setting themselves up and</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.870" end="01:27:57.310" style="s2">partnering but also recognizing that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.050" end="01:27:59.350" style="s2">language that I use here is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.310" end="01:28:01.360" style="s2">got a game a game B transition we have</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.350" end="01:28:03.370" style="s2">to be able to rebuild stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.360" end="01:28:06.730" style="s2">operates in and with the game a flows</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.370" end="01:28:09.940" style="s2">but nonetheless doesn&#39;t becoming capable</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.730" end="01:28:12.739" style="s2">of delivering on the game B values so</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.940" end="01:28:15.739" style="s2">that&#39;s another group</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.739" end="01:28:17.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a series of potential folks in</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.739" end="01:28:19.040" style="s2">the Bay Area who have I&#39;ve interacted</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.780" end="01:28:20.239" style="s2">with a kind of like the level we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.040" end="01:28:23.080" style="s2">interacting that they&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.239" end="01:28:26.320" style="s2">engaging in some kind of bat signaling</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.080" end="01:28:28.429" style="s2">generative bass signaling effort that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.320" end="01:28:30.020" style="s2">think what I&#39;ll probably want to do is</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.429" end="01:28:32.420" style="s2">maybe get you into a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.020" end="01:28:34.280" style="s2">the deep code folks here if I can use</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.420" end="01:28:36.500" style="s2">your send them the link to your medium</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.280" end="01:28:39.320" style="s2">post as an entree that would be perfect</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.500" end="01:28:42.110" style="s2">yeah everybody say oh here they can map</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.320" end="01:28:43.250" style="s2">it and also when I&#39;m up in San Francisco</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.110" end="01:28:44.630" style="s2">maybe just invite you to be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.250" end="01:28:46.909" style="s2">conversation with the Terran collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.630" end="01:28:48.909" style="s2">just I think there might be some fun</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.909" end="01:28:51.980" style="s2">synergy there and it would just be love</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.909" end="01:28:53.300" style="s2">yeah I would love that and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.980" end="01:28:55.610" style="s2">we can go down there&#39;s a lot a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.300" end="01:29:01.330" style="s2">stuff that can come down the road mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.610" end="01:29:01.330" style="s2">oh it turns out that the guy the guy</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.780" end="01:29:08.840" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.869" end="01:29:31.500" style="s2">the metaphysics work also happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.420" end="01:29:34.500" style="s2">probably the most skilled stop for</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.500" end="01:29:36.270" style="s2">engineer alive or in the top five and so</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.500" end="01:29:37.500" style="s2">he told me yesterday that he he is now</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.270" end="01:29:38.969" style="s2">reached the point where he must teach me</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.500" end="01:29:41.429" style="s2">how to code to continue to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.969" end="01:29:43.230" style="s2">communicate with me so I know I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.429" end="01:29:44.969" style="s2">to be entering into a pot of wine ship</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.230" end="01:29:49.500" style="s2">of extending my coding capabilities from</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.969" end="01:29:50.909" style="s2">like maybe level two to level five it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.500" end="01:29:52.260" style="s2">wonderful getting getting into the weeds</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.909" end="01:29:53.820" style="s2">of the complexity is something that</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.260" end="01:29:57.000" style="s2">gives you just such a visceral</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.820" end="01:30:01.590" style="s2">appreciation for you know for the</p>

<p begin="01:30:05.760" end="01:30:12.030" style="s2">have one minute I saw there&#39;s an artist</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.130" end="01:30:14.520" style="s2">who took the the memory buffers in like</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.030" end="01:30:17.820" style="s2">a Super Nintendo system referred for</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.520" end="01:30:21.840" style="s2">games for the game card basically mapped</p>

<p begin="01:30:21.840" end="01:30:25.400" style="s2">this game and basically took each memory</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.489" end="01:30:28.889" style="s2">buffer and graphed it you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.400" end="01:30:31.230" style="s2">see effectively programmer fingerprints</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.889" end="01:30:32.520" style="s2">Oh imprint programmers have these</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.230" end="01:30:35.090" style="s2">different character s your</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.520" end="01:30:41.499" style="s2">characteristics in terms of how they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:30:50.050" end="01:30:53.199" style="s2">play out as patterns over the memory</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.670" end="01:30:55.510" style="s2">buffers and he sells these things as art</p>
