<p begin="00:00:14.920" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">society the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.359" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">is that we are moving from a story of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">separation to</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:09.320" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.960" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">call him a non-institutional and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.320" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">non-institutionalized intellectual i</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">find that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">the most interesting generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:17.840" style="s2">the most interesting intellectuals and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.840" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">tend to be outside of academia these</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">maybe there are some exceptions but i</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">feel like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:27.759" style="s2">like daniel&#39;s a kindred spirit because</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">both of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.759" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">have walked a path</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t prescribed and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s taken us both to places that were</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">not on the map</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">at least that&#39;s that&#39;s how daniel has</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">landed on me</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">that he&#39;s gained insights and developed</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">that are not on the menu</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">conventionally speaking so yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">really excited to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">share some of those with you we just</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">recorded</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">a podcast a couple days ago for his</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">and um dan you were such a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">gracious and generous and skillful</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">interviewer</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">i felt uh really humbled by that and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">hope to be able to return the favor</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">so welcome to a new ancient story thanks</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">charles it&#39;s fun being here with you i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">us getting to have this dialogue yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">maybe we could begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">by i&#39;ll just say that you use</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">certain vocabulary that is unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">and it took me a little while listening</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">to you to really begin to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">understand what you were saying um</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">talking about things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">multi-polar traps and existential crises</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s a few uh non-rivalrous games</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">and i think that those will come up and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">when they do come up maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">pause for explanation of those things we</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">had a plan to start about</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">talking about the paper clip maximizer</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">problem and this like it&#39;s like this ai</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">but it has huge implications for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">direction of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">civilization even down to a deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">philosophical level so</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">is it cool if we just start with that do</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">you want to introduce that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">so um some of the listeners have</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">probably heard of the paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">maximizer thought experiment for those</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">who haven&#39;t to construct it briefly</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">i believe the term was first introduced</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">or at least introduced to the public by</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">a researcher named nick bostrom in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">book called super intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">where he was exploring the risks of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">artificial intelligence and there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">many different</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">ai risk scenarios and one of the general</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">ones is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">called a paperclip maximizer and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">idea is that we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">an ai getting a sadistic will of its own</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">against us or even being applied to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">weapons to be problematic</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">the idea of the paperclip maximizer is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">you basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">have some goal that you want to train an</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">artificial intelligence system on to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">optimize whatever that goal is and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">know when we look at being able to train</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">an ai</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">on a particular goal like winning chess</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">or winning alphago or something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">that we see that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">if they understand the boundaries of how</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">they could optimize that they get</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">capable of things that humans couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">do very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">and so let&#39;s say i have a factory and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">produce whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">and in this case just for simplicity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">selena&#39;s sake i produce paper clips</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">and i train the ai system</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">on the goal of maximizing the number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">paper clips that i can produce</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">and increasing the efficiency of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">paper clip production</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">so first it gets trained on the data</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">sets of my entire supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">and my whole manufacturing process and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">it sees where there are inefficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">in the manufacturing in the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">it figures out how to tighten up those</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">those inefficiencies and the business is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">just running better that&#39;s awesome that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">could even seem like a good thing for</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">the environment because of decreased</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">inefficiencies and things like that but</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">if it continues to get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">actually as it gets more intelligent it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">gets better at getting more intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">the key to the paperclip maximizer is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">that it does two things it does whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">goal you train it on plus it gets better</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">at its ability to do that goal</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">and it gets better with an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">curve because as it gets smarter</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">it&#39;s also smarter at figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">get smarter so you have compounding</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">returns on intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">that are then all applied to doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">whatever the thing is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">um pretty soon it starts running out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">substrate</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:44.560" style="s2">to make paper clips and so it starts</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">uh looking at how to make paper clips</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">from additional substrate so it&#39;s starts</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s effective and so we&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">my news feed is totally different than</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">your news feed</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s based on what is the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">sticky addictive stuff for me possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">and it tends to be that if i get</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">it&#39;s probably going to be things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">involve attractive people of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">opposite gender</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">and things that scare me anger me or</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">create and group out group dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s appealing to my limbic</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">breaks it was appealing to my rational</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">brain rationing i&#39;d say i need to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">the fog off facebook and go get some</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">work done</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">and so we see that just using facebook</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">as an example here</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">people who are on the left and people</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">because from using facebook not because</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">facebook has the goal to make them</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">radical but it simply has the goal to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">engage them more and the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">scares them and makes them angry</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">and that they share because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">scared and angry is stickier</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">and ends up being more viral so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">like oh wow the paperclip maximizer of</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">or of youtube videos that is simply</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">has as an externality the entire</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a big deal so we can see</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">that paper clip maximizing is already</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">happening with</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">a thought experiment for how our</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">which is if you have a</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">particular simple metrics</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll kind of take a break and see</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">charles where</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">you want to go before building out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">example but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">idea is that civilization as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">right now has paper clip maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">elements as a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">system that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">the core of the issue that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">yeah it brings up for me lewis mumford</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">and his characterization of the mega</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">machine he called it</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">yeah which basically he was saying what</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">was the first machine</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">in the sense of of a industrial entity</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">and he said it was it was the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">builder civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">where human beings were the components</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">of this machine</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">doing standardized jobs controlled</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">by the hierarch by the pharaoh or</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">whoever it was and this allowed whoever</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">was in control of this machine</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">to perform god-like feats</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">which was why the pharaoh or whoever was</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">given a</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">semi-divine status and he says the basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">model of the machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">already existed 5000 years ago yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">the standardization of roles and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">what happened is eventually the human</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">were replaced by mechanical parts so</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">one person now controlling a machine can</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">perform god-like feats like</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">moving at rapid rates of speed flying</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">through the air communicating</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">instantaneously over vast distances and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">so forth we&#39;re all gods</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">now because we are at the helm of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">of a machine and so like so the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">of civilization could also be thought of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">as a computer</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">or as an artificial intelligence because</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">it definitely has an intelligence beyond</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">that of any human being it can solve</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">that no one person could solve and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:50.839" style="s2">then it&#39;s what you&#39;re saying is okay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">what are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.839" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">imperatives of of this machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">and gosh it sure looks like maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">gdp</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">or maximizing human dominion or</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">producing more and more you know more</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">whatever motives and incentives are</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">built into the machine it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">a better and better job at accomplishing</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">and yeah where is this going and how can</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">stop the world from turning into paper</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">clips or money</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">right so let&#39;s let&#39;s explore the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">model applied to civilization in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">detail</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">so if you think about a colony of ants</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">or termites you see that the colony as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">whole has</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">certain kinds of intelligence that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">individual ants don&#39;t have right</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">none of the ants on their own know how</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">to make a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">ant mound of that type or underground</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">labyrinth of that type and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:47.760" style="s2">coordinated behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">of all of them has the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.760" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">that so we would call this a collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">and it rather than being centralized</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">that there is one consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">of the uh ant colony controlling</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">everything it&#39;s a decentralized emergent</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">where we generally think of it and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:08.959" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">many examples of that so the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.959" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">we&#39;re describing here today is that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">the thing that we call civilization is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">that is misfit</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">for its ongoing continuation with itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">misfit for its ongoing continuation with</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">life it has kind of mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">self-terminating processes built</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">in and we&#39;re getting close enough to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">self-termination points that those can</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">start to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">eminent so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll look at those so</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">let&#39;s just take capitalism to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ll expand because we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">to say that communism wasn&#39;t this it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">too capitalism was just the better</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">version which is why i got selected for</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:51.959" style="s2">um so if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">what capitalism is as a system of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.959" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">decentralized incentive</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">the incentive is controlling or</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">influencing patterns of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">if people can make money and survive</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">doing a particular thing and they make</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">less money</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">and are less able to survive doing other</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">things then there is a incentive to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">certain things</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">and if they can move beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">surviving to actually getting ahead</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">there&#39;s more incentive to do the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">that keep increasing their</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">capacity because of all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">money makes possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">and eventually those who are near the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">top of the money hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">want to continue to double down on</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">whatever it is that increases</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">the capacity to be there so then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:34.800" style="s2">what the nature of incentive</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">fiscal incentive looks like and we say</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">okay well</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">i can&#39;t really get dollars for</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">leaving whales live in the ocean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:45.600" style="s2">not i can&#39;t convert their light</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">life onto my balance sheet but if i kill</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.600" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">them i can get dollars for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">by selling the whale meat and i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:52.399" style="s2">get many dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">by leaving trees alive in an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.399" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">but as two by fours i can sell</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">them so in general there&#39;s a movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">towards extraction and commodification</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">okay so we see the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">movement we see that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">maybe the largest block of global</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">economics writ large if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">take all the things that make it up is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">the military industrial complex so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">see that war is super profitable and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">can make a lot of money by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:18.040" style="s2">we look at all the areas we see so money</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">ends up being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.040" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">decentralized incentive system that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">orients everyone towards the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">can make more of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">and as we look at the evolution of kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">of the economic system itself we say</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">just like the paperclip maximizer gets</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">better and better at being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">its thing we say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">original humans were just sharing</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">resources in tribal settings and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">there was exchange between</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">tribes and then we can look at uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">early currencies and then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">fiat currencies and then fractional</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">reserve banking and then high speed</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">trading on digital</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">fractional reserve banking that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">much like the curve of a paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">maximizer</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">that is getting better and better at</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">being able to get all of the humans to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">do its bidding and here&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">key</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">way of thinking about it it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">its own ability to be an actuator to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">stuff in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">outside of getting humans to do the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">so any human that does the bidding of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">meaning converts more of nature into</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">that can be put on a balance sheet and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">we&#39;re oversimplifying here but</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">to get the idea we&#39;ll expand in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">anyone who does its bidding well</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">will get more power within the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">right they get more money which ends up</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">meeting more influence and then also</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">more influence to continue to double</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">down on their ability to keep having</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">that influence i get enough money and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">can actually start to make laws</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:45.039" style="s2">by paying lobbyists that support the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">government&#39;s ability to have me keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.039" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">making that money or to even subsidize</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">how i make the money or</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">i make enough money that i can start</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">controlling the media</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">to be able to control the collective</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">opinion of all the other humans to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">support me continue to make money so</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">uh as i do better in the system i get</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">more capable of doing more better in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">so exactly it&#39;s exactly parallel to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">ai learning how to learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">better and better right and the humans</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">so the humans that basically do the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">bidding of the system get more power in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">it the people who are at the top</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">of the power hierarchy are the people</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">uh most perfectly aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">the will of that system and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">look at kind of what the will of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">system not from a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">anthropomorphic but just from a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">behavioral disposition point of view</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">is and then the people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">oppose the system if they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">effective at opposing the system or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">risk to those who are in power and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">will inherently have less power so they</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">get taken out</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">of some form and if you look at like</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">famous people who got assassinated</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">they were pretty much all against the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">paperclip maximizer and they mostly got</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">taken out by people who were stewards of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">the paperclip maximizer at the time the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">system and so the interesting thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">the pharaoh or the head of the big banks</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">or the whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">actually in charge the key thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">a symptom of a system that incentivizes</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">people to do those behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">they are actually an emergent property</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.039" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:15.280" style="s2">are there sociopaths running the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">yes of course there are sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.280" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">running the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">um because if you create a system where</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">to get to the top of a power hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">you have to beat lots of people in zero</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">sum win lose games to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">get up i have to actually be good at</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">beating people at</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">good at and oriented to beating people</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">at zero sum win-lose games</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">to get to the top which will include</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">lying and disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">and externalizing harm and layoffs</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">whatever it has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">involve but you see it we have a system</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">that attracts</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">sociopathy and then conditions rewards</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">and trains it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">and whereas like living in a tribe you</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">would not do well as a sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">right you&#39;d do very badly and so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have an evolutionary environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">we have a system where</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">the very top of the power hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">an evolutionary niche for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">most abusive with power</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">in those particular kinds of ways but</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">effectively abusive meaning that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">they figure out how to game the system</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">to support them continuing to do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">um so it&#39;s like the are there sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">around the world of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">are there people who conspire against</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">for their own goals against other people</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">of course there are and for every</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">watergate or enron there&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">that don&#39;t get publicly acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean every conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">theory is true most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">gibberish but</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">a lot of them are true but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">the cause of the problems it is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">symptom of a system that incentivizes</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">conspiring</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">if you incentivize something it will</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">happen right that&#39;s kind of the supply</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">and demand</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">dynamic of it and at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">supply and demand dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">is not a particular good or service it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">get more power within the system</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">yeah so sociopathic traits are</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">basically part of the job description</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">for being in the elite</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t enact those traits then</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">you will be squeezed out in one way or</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">and somebody who&#39;s more sociopathic will</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">step into those rules</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">and you&#39;re also saying that there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">conspiracies but the whole system itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t a conspiracy it&#39;s not that an evil</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">created this system and is running it in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">order to enslave everybody it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">the system created the evil elite that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">operates its levers so they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">like functionaries than puppet masters</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">well and then of course it&#39;s recursive</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s how the system works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">the deep learning system has a recursive</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">element so the people who get into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">positions of power will then</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">work to control or to influence public</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">influence law to support them being in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">so do they do stuff that is directly</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">harmful to the system writ lars or to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">the commons at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">yes of course they do and do they do</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">stuff that increases their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">of course that is what the system</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">predisposition is</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">well that&#39;s not very cheerful daniel</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">i mean it seems like like and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">getting better and better and better at</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">it or are they</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">like some of these things they get</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">exponentially better for a while but</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">then they</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">you know level off and they reach an</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">inherent limit like it looks like our</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">doing that in a way which is reflected</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">the slowdown in the rate of economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">um the decreasing effectiveness of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">solve basic problems like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">look so exponential anymore</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">what do you think about that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">if we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">development of uh the things we call</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">civilizations historically</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">there will be some pioneering effort to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">go explore some new</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">territory niche of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">most of those don&#39;t work and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">expensive and then the ones that do work</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">become the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">a new development and then you get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">of development on whatever that thing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">hey now we&#39;re mining like we figured</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">that thing out or</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">now we&#39;ve got this spot that&#39;s good or</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">now we&#39;re working the plow here or</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">and then you will start to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">place where you get um</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">you know early people having captured</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">much of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:25.919" style="s2">power system associated with those</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">things the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">pioneering landscape having not having</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">open opportunities for new people to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">pioneer from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">and so then everybody else has to work</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">for the people who already</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:39.280" style="s2">did the early pioneering in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">and so the first people who were doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">thing was had a direct relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:51.919" style="s2">with pioneering innovation with actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">the natural world itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">or with um yeah reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">and then and so they were able to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">ahead through an innovative process</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">at a certain point there&#39;s no more space</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">to actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">innovate or come up with new stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">so on your own so what you end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">is working for the existing system and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">all those people are in a domestication</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">system and there is an upper limit on</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">what they can do and the only way they</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">can get ahead is to climb</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">that power hierarchy so they go to work</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">for a company rather than the very few</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:26.000" style="s2">people who found the company</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">and of course most the companies fail</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">and the founders</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">do it they fail the few that make it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">there&#39;s now a huge cash room coming in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">then everybody goes to work there</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">the people who work there are not going</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">to have as much power as the people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">founded it</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">as time goes on it gets bigger even less</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">so and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">at a certain point climbing that power</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">hierarchy whether it&#39;s a government</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">or a corporation or whatever becomes my</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">only way to get ahead more than doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">innovation and so i have to get better</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">and better at figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">win at power hierarchy kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">and so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">the court of versailles and louis xiv</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">and the courtier type dynamics there was</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">a world where everyone like nobody was</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">fundamentally new stuff or new</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">innovation there was no real pioneering</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">everyone was just trying to get more of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">the power somebody already had</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">uh you know bestowed on them and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">what we call politics</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">and the things that give you power</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">within an institution are not</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">necessarily the same things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">make the institution more effective make</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">the government work better make the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">corporation make more money even</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">like so very very often</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">uh actually it&#39;s usually the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">that right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">we we can&#39;t do things that are so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">damaging to it that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">damage my ability to get ahead but i</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">also don&#39;t need to optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">organization i have to optimize my own</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">bonus structure within the organization</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">i have to also optimize my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">get away with the fact that optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">my bonus structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">is not optimizing the company and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">hiding transparency like systems that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">decrease transparency and the decrease</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">accountability so we&#39;ll make a limited</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">liability</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">law that doesn&#39;t make me accountable to</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">certain things we&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">certain kinds of corporate veils where</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">nobody can even tell who&#39;s doing certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">things well</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">you know whatever right and those</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">basically those breakdowns</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">of accountability and justice end up</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">leading to again doubling down on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">environmental niche we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">the more sociopathic thing actually is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">selected for</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">but i guess why i&#39;m saying this is we</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">see this interesting thing where</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">you know in the last years and decades</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a tremendous amount of new</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">wealth</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">that is not part of kind of older wealth</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">systems because of a proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">software tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">and the people who do that are still</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:51.840" style="s2">part of the paperclip maximizer</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">as a whole but of a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.840" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">type</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">someone who didn&#39;t come from the mindset</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">of being at the top of a power</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">hierarchy and mostly maintain their</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">is pretty close to purely political</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">how they relate one of them is this</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">as a whole less efficient so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">does this mean that there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">a light at the end of the tunnel like a</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">like could we build an alternative or</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">could we somehow take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">of the built-in inefficiencies</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">propose so and we&#39;ll get to it um</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not from exploiting the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">inefficiencies because what makes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">corporation inefficient or a country</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">actually still serves the paper clip</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">maximize or writ large because it just</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">moves the center of power from that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">from you know microsoft to google from</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">us to china or you know british empire</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">to us or whatever it is and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">the paper clip maximizer keeps doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">quite well as the local parts rise and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">then collapse rise and then collapse but</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">continue to whenever one part is</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">uh starting to collapse all the adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">things that learn just move to a new</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple more ideas we have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">construct to get into the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">because we</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">we haven&#39;t specified the key of why this</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:23.919" style="s2">system works the way it does yet</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">okay i&#39;ll be patient</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.919" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">so one thing you know you and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">uh talked about this before when we to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">define what evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">not just in a biologic sense but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">deepest sense that complexity</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">science gives us is that evolution is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">increase in ordered complexity</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">that leads in the direction of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.279" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">and that what&#39;s being selected for</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">emergent properties so</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">you know a cell respirates</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">even though none of the molecules on</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">their own that make up a cell respirate</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">it&#39;s an emergent property and so there</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">is advantage to those molecules being</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">together from even a thermodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t being a part so we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">say that biologic evolution is a special</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">case of this larger principle by which</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">subatomic particles come into</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">atoms into molecules and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">process of increasing complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">complexity that doesn&#39;t have emergent</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">property doesn&#39;t get selected for</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s ordered complexity in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">way as emergent property the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">properties come from synergies</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">and so we can say evolution is defined</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">by these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">synergies and increasing complexity so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">we look at a biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">and we see we see the complexity of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">single organism like a cell that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">really incomprehensible and or a tree</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">but then we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">intercomplexities of all the cells</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">in a tree or all the cells in an animal</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">and then the relationships between the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.960" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">aerobic and the anaerobic bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">between the predator and the prey in</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">gas exchanges and all the things like</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">wow right</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">and and it keeps increasing over time</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">of course you&#39;re going to have some</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">species die off and new species come</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">about but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">over time you get an increase in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:09.919" style="s2">complexity of the species from</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">single cell you know up to neurologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.919" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">then reptiles and mammals and primates</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">and on and on</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">right more complex nervous systems more</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">complex behavioral patterns</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">so the interesting thing there is we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">we can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">the paper clip maximizer has the exact</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">directional orientation as evolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">evolution is increasing the orderly</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">which automatically means that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">increases the type of diversities in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">and the synergies between those</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">diversities right so in an old growth</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">there&#39;s radical diversity and also</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">radical synergy across</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">all those diversities and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">oriented to the continuation of both</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">the diversity and the order the agency</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">and the communion the individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">the interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">um and the paperclip maximizer takes</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">complex stuff and makes simple stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">and so if we think about that for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">minute we</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">take the example of a tree in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">tree in the forest is super complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">you know if we ask like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">value of a tree we have to start by even</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">saying value to whom</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">and whose perspective who is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">beneficiary of value</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">and we start to look and we&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">pretty much everybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">is a beneficiary of the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">tree but they&#39;re different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">value the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">pollinators come get a certain thing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">the birds that live in it get another</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">thing and the squirrels that live in it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">get another thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">fish that live in the river that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">cleaner water because the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">top soil was stabilized by the roots get</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">another thing and the fungus in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">soil that has the mycorrhizae that has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:46.480" style="s2">relationship with the roots is another</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.039" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">thing we&#39;re like okay and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.480" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">sequestering of co2 and the production</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">of oxygen for the mammals</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">so the tree has a a kind of indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">number of beneficiaries</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">that it benefits with an indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">number of different outputs</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">right so this is like not optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">a single output</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">to a single kind of beneficiary it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">you can&#39;t even call it optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">actually um but if you wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">loosely here it&#39;s optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">synergetic</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">benefit across this whole interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">web of things</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">and so we take the tree and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">worth anything economically to me but if</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">i cut it down</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">and turn it into a two by four now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">worth something economically</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">and the tree</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">is self-organizing and self-healing</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">if i burn the forest the forest will</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">regrow right</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">if i burn the house that i&#39;m in made of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">two by fours it doesn&#39;t regrow if i burn</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">the two by four it doesn&#39;t regrow</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">and so i take something that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">anti-fragile</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">that is resilient and i turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">something non-resilient and fragile i</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">take something that affects many</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">beneficiaries and i try to capture it</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">for one beneficiary</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">i take something with many value types</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">and i try to turn it into one value type</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">right so now i turn this very complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">thing of a tree into a very simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">called a two by four</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">and then i might build a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">thing out of the simple things a house</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">complicated different than complex the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">tree self-organizes the house doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">self-organize</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">make a blueprint somebody builds it from</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">the outside the forest self heals the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">house doesn&#39;t self heal</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">the forest evolves towards more</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">increasing complexity the house and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">tropically breaks down in time</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">yeah so humans build complicated stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">complicated stuff is inherently fragile</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">our our laptops don&#39;t self-repair they</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">don&#39;t self-organize neither do our roads</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">infrastructure or water systems or</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">whatever and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">we convert the anti-fragile complexity</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">of the natural world that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">brought about</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">into simple and then complicated</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">fragile in entropic more than syntropic</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">stuff which require top-down management</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">because they don&#39;t organically maintain</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">right i mean maybe another example of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">would be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">imposition of monocultures cultural</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">agricultural various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">monocultures on the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">which is reduction of uniqueness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">complexity into something</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">simple the ultimate of which would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">the monoculture called money</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">which is pure quantity right so say i</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">take the tree</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">i turn it into two by fours and now i</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">can accumulate a bunch of these two by</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">fours</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">so i can build something out of it but i</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">can also trade them</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">but they&#39;re a little bit cumbersome to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">trade actually i can&#39;t the liquidity is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">not high enough that i can just trade a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">bunch of them in a hurry if i want</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">so i actually don&#39;t even want to store</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">the two by fours i want to sell them</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">right away and get</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">money because even though the money has</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">no actual value it&#39;s purely</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">representative value meaning i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">build a house out of it or eat it or</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">really anything because of its liquidity</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">for other forms of value it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">maximize my</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">choice my freedom my optionality so</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t want trees i want two by fours</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want two by fours i want</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">and then because i can&#39;t spend a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">on amazon i actually don&#39;t want dollars</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">i want bits</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">which is the digital dollar in an</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">account that has maximum liquidity and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">its potential</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">and so we actually see each of those are</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">a step towards more simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">and so now we have a world that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">convert</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">the natural world and human creativity</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">and human labor and all of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">into bits of a particular type that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">abstractable</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">fungible tradable optimizable</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">that is exactly the opposite direction</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">of evolution it is decreasing orderly</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">complexity it is converting</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">the anti-fragile natural world into an</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">increasingly fragile built world</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:45.359" style="s2">and then we&#39;re trying to run</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">exponentially more flow through an</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.359" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">increasingly fragile system so when we</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:52.000" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">oil pipeline spills we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.000" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">fragility of the system that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">run more and more stuff through it when</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">we look at wars and economic collapse</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">and environmental collapse we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">at breakdowns of fragile systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">but if we keep trying to convert the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">anti-fragility of the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">into increasingly fragile world that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to run exponentially more</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">flux through</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">that self-terminates and process</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">self-terminates</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">but there the fiscal incentive is in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">that direction</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">and again it doesn&#39;t take everyone like</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">you could have a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">man something matters more than money i</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do that but anyone does</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">that thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">and of course they might have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">fiduciary responsibility to shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">they might</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">whatever it is anyone does the thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">that continues in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">and they gain so much more money which</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">equals power which means adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">advantage that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">everyone else has to justify continuing</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">to do that or they lose in the economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">competition by default</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">now that&#39;s the concept you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">earlier called the multipolar trap</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:52.079" style="s2">the multipolar trap is one term to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">able to explain a scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.079" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a lot of different agents</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:56.160" style="s2">that are in an assumed competitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">relationship with each other so the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.160" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">agent could just be individual people</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">competing with other people or it could</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">be tribes competing against each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">or corporations or</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">countries right but some agent that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">acting for its own</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">benefits through the polls in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">multi-polar right</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">okay and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">so if any of the agents does something</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:19.040" style="s2">that is bad for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">bad for the commons over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.040" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">but that provides</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">a lot of near-term advantage to them</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a big incentive for them to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">if they do then all the other agents in</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">have to try and do that as well to not</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">where that agent was getting ahead</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">or they do lose by default so they</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">basically anyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">exploiting such an opportunity creates a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">gradient for everyone else to race to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">exploit that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">so the tragedy of the commons and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">arms race are two classic examples</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">tragedy of the commons is okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to fish all the fish out</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">because i actually think fish are</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">i&#39;m in a tribe or i love them i want</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">them to be there in the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to cut down all the forests</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">i think forests are beautiful i want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">keep hunting in it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">and i actually don&#39;t need that many</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">trees but if i</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">only cut down the trees that i need from</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">our traveling cuts on the trees we need</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">and to leave the forest the forest still</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to get left because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">other tribe is going to go cut down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">or some other tribe beyond that one is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">so i don&#39;t even have the choice to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">protect the forest</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">so if it&#39;s going to be them cut down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">trees or me cut down the trees and if</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">they cut them down</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.200" style="s2">they&#39;re going to build weapons to attack</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">me they&#39;re going to build storage of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.200" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">resource to get through the famines</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">they&#39;re going to all those things</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">i have to go cut the trees down not only</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">do i have to cut down more than i need</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">and store it i have to do it faster than</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">because they are an assumed competitor</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re thinking the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">they&#39;re only doing that because they</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">assume i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">so everyone is now in the situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:55.440" style="s2">where they assume somebody does the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2"> up thing and i&#39;m like well we</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.440" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">could make a treaty</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">okay so me and this other tribe and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">other tribe close by all make a treaty</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">that we only cut down x number of trees</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">cool but the other tribe is totally</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">sucks and they won&#39;t join the treaty and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">so they&#39;re going to do the up</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">thing so we can&#39;t even keep the treaty</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">we all have to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">right so then we cut down all the trees</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">and we actually race to go from</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">axes to saws to chainsaws to whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">cut down the trees as fast as possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">to get there before the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:23.680" style="s2">and this is why 80 percent of the old</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:25.839" style="s2">growth forests are gone this is why</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.680" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">ninety percent of the large fish species</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.839" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">uh populations are gone the whales or</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:31.359" style="s2">whatever else is because</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">multiple traps so that&#39;s the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">the commons example</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">and the arms race is if some say</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">somebody produces this new terrible</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">weapon</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">and nobody wants to live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">without terrible weapon because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">just worse for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">everybody&#39;s more likely to die in</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">terrible wars but if anyone produces a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">new terrible weapon everybody else has</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">to produce a terrible weapon to be able</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">to have any chance in organs and plus</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">they have to produce defenses and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">counter offenses to the terrible weapons</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">they have to increase</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">total terrible weaponry in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">right and if they don&#39;t they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">going to lose</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">so we saw that with nukes we see that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">with ai weapons happening right now we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">saw that with chemical weapons biologic</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">weapons we saw that from the cannon</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">right like just</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">the the bronze age the stone tools and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">so here&#39;s how we define it</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">where an agent can get ahead independent</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">of the well-being of other agents</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">or the commons and even at the expense</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">of other agents of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the rivalrous game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">environment rivalrous meaning i am both</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">rivalrous with the commons and rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">with other agents</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">in that environment my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">exploit the commons</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">faster than the other guys and find some</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">new way to do it in which case then all</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">the other guys need to be racing to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">that same exploitation with me</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to bind that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">unless we try and create the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">historically the only way to bind that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">what we call multi-polar trap is with</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">agreement right that&#39;s what the um can</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">we make a treaty to not do it is but how</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">would we enforce that anyone keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">agreement well there has to then be some</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">monopoly of force that is stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.760" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">any of the agents that can say hey if</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t keep the agreement we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">to put some</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">force on you to push you back into it so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">one of the main reasons we have created</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">governments is to bind multipolar traps</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">so you have some monopoly of force</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">meaning the police force that is backed</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">up by the national guard or the military</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">whatever that is backing up law because</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">law wouldn&#39;t be that thing without</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:33.839" style="s2">monopoly of force</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">so the idea now is we try and create</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">laws to bind the multi-polar traps you</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">can&#39;t cut down trees</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">in the protected area right in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">national forest or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">so we have an epa or an fda or an ftc or</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">somebody to protect against some bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">backed up by a monopoly force now and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">that&#39;s a national level or a state level</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">but it can also be at an international</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">level that&#39;s the idea of what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">u.n is right the that after world war</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">we&#39;re like oh national governments on</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">their own can&#39;t actually govern in a way</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">that keeps them from</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">wanting to blow the whole world up and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:09.920" style="s2">our technology is now so</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">terrible that we can&#39;t have wars like</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.920" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">this anymore so can we create some</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">supranational organization that was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">league of nations</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">league of nations obviously failed in</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">its goal of preventing world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">and so we changed the name called the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">united nations and so the goal there was</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">let&#39;s do nuclear disarmament because now</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">nuclear is the really big thing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">let&#39;s prevent</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">spread of nukes and the use of them and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">we haven&#39;t had world war</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">iii formally kinetically yet but</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">we went from two countries having nukes</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">19 or however many having nukes and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:44.400" style="s2">nukes not even being the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">concerning thing now in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">exponential tech mediated weapons</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">everybody&#39;s got them not even state</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">actors so we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">okay well why is it that the top down</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">force the un</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">has a monopoly force why can&#39;t it keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">the nations</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">in check well because the nations have</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">too much power for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">u.n to have a monopoly of force over</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">them so say you&#39;re a country with nukes</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to do nuclear d</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">proliferation we say okay you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna give up your last nuke now</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">you&#39;re like no i&#39;m not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2"> stupid i give up my last nuke</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">and somebody&#39;s gonna come invade me</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">who has nukes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">so you&#39;ll lie and say this is your last</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">nuke we&#39;ll stockpiling some other ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">right and then not agree to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">inspections or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">um and because you assume that whoever</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">else is giving up their last nuke is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">also lying</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">and stockpiling some and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">multi-polar trap thing right</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">and so then if the u.n so nobody wants a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">volunteer to give it up so</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">then can the u.n force and say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">going to force you to give up your last</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">nuke they&#39;re like no off we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">nukes you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that so multipolar traps</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">from bottom up dynamics market</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:54.000" style="s2">style dynamics can&#39;t be bound by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">um or countries competing by each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">can&#39;t be bound by the country they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">be bound at their own level</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">and top-down forces can only bind them</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">when there is a monopoly of force and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">that is oriented to bind them</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">and at this point because of exponential</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">tech</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">there can never be a monopoly of force</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">in the same way there was previously</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">um because the bottom-up forces are too</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">to be overread in that way and so we say</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:25.760" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">all right so now we have this place</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.760" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">where we have multipolar traps of all</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">kinds right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">build ai as fast as you can for all</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">purposes that there&#39;s incentive for</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">including weapons</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">right or things like that and if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:41.280" style="s2">makes a law</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.560" style="s2">that tries to protect against</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.280" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">something like an environmental</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">destruction whoever has the economic</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">interest to do that environmental</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">destruction has the economic incentive</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">to pay lots of lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">to change the law and to hide that under</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">other thing that doesn&#39;t seem to make</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">any sense that nobody pays attention to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">and to pay for campaign budgets and to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">you know all those types of things so we</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">end up seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">law falls to economic incentive when</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">it&#39;s even though it&#39;s supposed to bind</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">economic incentive the problems of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">because economics is actually deeper in</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">the stack of power</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">than law and government is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">yeah quite a few things in there you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">basically establishing uh one pillar</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">after another after another</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:27.280" style="s2">of an argument that i think you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">to continue developing</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.280" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll just add like maybe a supporting</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">comment i read a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">actual tragedy of the commons the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">textbook example</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">was villagers grazing their sheep and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s to the advantage of any one</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">villager to graze</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:46.319" style="s2">them as much as possible so that his</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">herd increases but if everybody does</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.319" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">that then</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">the pastor gets overgrazed and</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">but no it&#39;s to nobody&#39;s interest to rein</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">historically however according to what i</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">that didn&#39;t happen because the community</p>

<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">would feel shame and so people actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">got along quite well and didn&#39;t destroy</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">their commons until</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">market economics and the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">separate individual came in</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">and introduced that logic and weakened</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">the informal ways that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">regulated the use of the commons and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">when that happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">then the imposition of force by a state</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">became necessary</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">so it was kind of a substitute for right</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">yeah okay so this is a super important</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">when we say that there&#39;s a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">force that binds the bottom up one that</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">has a monopoly of force</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">monopoly of force in the way we think</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">about it today is</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">um a actual police force or military</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">that is asymmetric to the physical</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">rebellion capacity of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">subset of the population now there was</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">something that you could think of as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">kind of monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">of influence before state type dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">that weren&#39;t just mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:19.359" style="s2">those type of police forces and it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">what you&#39;re describing right in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.359" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">if someone starts to behave in a poor</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">being ostracized from the community</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">right like being shamed or being</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">excluded or people not wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">interact with you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">you&#39;re you can no longer do it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">actually get ahead or survive if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">can&#39;t interact with people</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">and so uh that was actually able to work</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">at a fairly small number of total people</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:43.359" style="s2">where there was transparency to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.359" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">right so there&#39;s only three sheep</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">herders that can be letting that grazing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">and anyone who&#39;s doing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:53.359" style="s2">everybody can see</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">so remember how he said when there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.359" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">breakdown of transparency or a breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">of accountability you create the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">environmental niche for the bad actor</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">so as we get to larger sizes everybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">can&#39;t see what everybody&#39;s doing and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">becomes easier and easier to obscure</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">which is then where you have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">say okay well can we make government</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">bodies that can do investigation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">that kind of thing so if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">like if i if i&#39;m in a big</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">corporation nobody no one&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">watching what i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">um in the same way that they would be in</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">a tribe and particularly the only other</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">people who will be watching that closely</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">might have</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">somewhat i can coordinate it that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">might have somewhat aligned interests</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like the actual end users</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">that we&#39;re making products for that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">on the other side of the world have any</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">idea what i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">and or there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">accountability within the corporation to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">make sure you&#39;re not embezzling funds or</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">yeah that you know but that only keeps</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">acting in the interest of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">corporation not in the interests of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">the other the other stakeholders</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">right and so this is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">for most of human history we had people</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">inside of families inside of extended</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">families inside of communities</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">inside of groups of communities and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">there was organization that happened at</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">each of those levels it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">cells inside of a tissue inside of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">organs inside of organ systems inside of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">a body it&#39;s not just like</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">50 trillion cells inside of your body</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">with no</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">substructured organization it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">work at all but right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">the family doesn&#39;t actually provision</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">resources all that much families become</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">largely broken saying especially the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">extended family and the families were</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">actually very good at provisioning</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2">having an inner investedness in each</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">other that wasn&#39;t game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.000" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">and knowing what each other needed</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">having enough awareness that if</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">someone had resources they could</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">provision within the family</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">and communities tribes were also pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">good at those types of issues because</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">you could actually see what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">and they could be inter-invested in each</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.760" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">and now you mostly have the individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.760" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">interacting with the market in the state</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">right the big giant</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">everything that is impersonal and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">as a voter consumer producer</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">and that system is</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">definitely broken</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">right so the problem isn&#39;t so much that</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.640" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2">too many people or that the scale of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:26.559" style="s2">society is too big it&#39;s more that there</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.559" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">enough coherent intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">structures like you can imagine having a</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">community where it&#39;s small enough that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">mutually regulate each other&#39;s behavior</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">and you&#39;re not going to graze your sheep</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">too much because then the blacksmith</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to help you and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">and the herbalist won&#39;t treat your kids</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">and so and then you can imagine having</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">the community</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">interacting with other communities in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">similar way where if one community</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:53.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t behave well</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:54.640" style="s2">then the other ones assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.359" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">they&#39;re interdependent enough the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">don&#39;t provide it with something it needs</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">then you could have</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">groups of a community of groups of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:05.119" style="s2">and then a community of a community of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">groups of communities and you could</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">imagine a planet operating on that level</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">which would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">a complex organic structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">rather than a disintermediated world</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">where you have an undifferentiated mass</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">of people and a hierarchical control</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">in the model of industry which is all</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">about the standardization of parts</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">the standardization of inputs and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">outputs and so forth so</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">maybe is where you&#39;re going with this</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:39.599" style="s2">like some kind of successor to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">industrial</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.599" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">model of organizing society</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">um so so let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">at complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">that evolved and have</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">uh orientation towards increasing</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">evolution and anti-fragility and like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple key principles that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.400" style="s2">we see that are important here</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">let&#39;s say we look at the 50 trillion</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.400" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">give or take cells in a body</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">which cells kind of run the show is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.079" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">silly question</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">there are no few cells that are elected</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">representatives or dictators or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">which cells have really asymmetric power</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">over all the other cells</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">there are and that was a delusion of of</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:28.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">physiologists i mean they people thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.480" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">that well the brain must be in charge</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s totally not like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">the cells in a petri dish will continue</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">to do their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">from liver cells or kidney cells or fat</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">cells or they are self-regulating in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:44.640" style="s2">bottom-up way</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">there are top-down effects where the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.640" end="00:54:48.079" style="s2">neuroendocrine system is gathering</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">big picture messages and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">communicating big picture information</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">back for coordination but the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">coordination is not just happening at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">cellular and top-down whole system level</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">there&#39;s coordination happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">level of a tissue</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s coordination happening at</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:02.720" style="s2">the level of an organ and that an organ</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">system so there is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.720" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">neither bottom up nor top down</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">and where the the bottom up influences</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">cascade all the way up to this emergent</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">top thing the top-down influences come</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">in turn affect the bottom-up ones</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s happening at all these layers</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">and so this is neither market nor</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">government this is something</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">much much more interesting and much more</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">complex but you see that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">at the level of a cell there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">symmetry of power where all the cells</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">they&#39;re all doing their thing but none</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">of them have asymmetric power over any</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">of the other cells</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">and you can think about as far as</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:40.559" style="s2">messaging goes cells are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">sharing messages to</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">other cells that they have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">relationship with mostly adjacent cells</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">we can see some effects where it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">an endocrine effect but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">going to be things of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">receptor type that it evolved to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">that relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">so why that is important let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">cell becomes a cancer cell this happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">to some degree just because of mutation</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">oxidation whatever that occurs the job</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">body is that to prevent the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.160" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">carcinogenesis that makes cancer cells</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">to make it much less common but when it</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:15.920" style="s2">does happen</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">to actually convert the cancer cells</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.920" end="00:56:19.119" style="s2">back to healthy cells and if it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">then it has to kill them so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.119" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">spread</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">uh kill the whole body because then</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">they&#39;re acting in a way where their own</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">interest is pit against the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:29.280" style="s2">everything else unlike healthy cells</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">healthy cells you know liver cells are</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">not competing with kidney cells</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">to accumulate more of the scarce</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">and liver and kidney writ large are not</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:40.160" style="s2">competing in that way right the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">bones will move calcium they&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.160" end="00:56:44.880" style="s2">into the blood for ph buffering or</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">into the brain for calcium ion dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.880" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">and then move them back in for storage</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this very complex provisioning</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">that is optimizing the well-being of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">whole system across every kind of metric</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">um but imagine</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:02.559" style="s2">that one cell became cancerous and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">had the ability to broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.559" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">its cancer signals its cancer genes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:09.200" style="s2">every other cell simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">and they would be uptaken because they</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.200" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">had they hit some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">addictive gradient or near-term</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">advantage gradient well</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">everybody would die of cancer very very</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:20.480" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.799" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">and so it&#39;s important that they&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.480" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">able to affect nearby ones and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">nearby ones exert a restorative force on</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">and so it actually requires the cancer</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:29.680" style="s2">is going to grow somewhat slowly the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">body has a lot of opportunity to deal</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.680" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">with it this is the only reason we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">not all dying of cancer all the time</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">and so today though</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">when you look at what broadcast media is</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">or you look at</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">just asymmetric power of any kind well</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">what is the asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">power of a putin or a trump in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">kinetic warfare compared to you or me</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s trillions of times what</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">is the asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:54.480" style="s2">fiscal power of the gates or bezos</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">compared to us what is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.480" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">asymmetric messaging capacity of a top</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">celebrity right in comparison</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">and so we look at the tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">mediating that kind of asymmetry so</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">broadcast messaging is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">i can transmit a meme that will catch on</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">it has certain stickiness or limbic</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">hijack dynamics but it&#39;s actually a bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">meme it moves things in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">direction but i can broadcast it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:21.359" style="s2">everybody and there&#39;s no check</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.440" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">mechanisms to see that that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.359" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">a good meme that was adapted for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">that&#39;s actually super destructive super</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">dangerous and you say</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:29.520" style="s2">can we have anti-fragility in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">presence of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.520" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">any agent becoming maladaptive and being</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">able to influence the whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">asymmetrically and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:40.240" style="s2">so now we come back to the example of if</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">i was in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">family in an extended family and a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">and a and i started doing something that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:47.280" style="s2">was maladaptive for the tribe there</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">would be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.280" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">pressure that sought to make me healthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:52.960" style="s2">and first it would see it pretty early</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">and sought to make me healthier before i</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.960" end="00:58:58.799" style="s2">had the ability to influence everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">um this is an important thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.799" end="00:59:01.200" style="s2">missing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:03.839" style="s2">so when we start to think about</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">means i have exponentially bigger</p>

<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">problem right so we need to say how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">we get good choice making</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">to scale faster than the power of our</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:48.319" style="s2">this this is like a fundamental thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re looking at here</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">but so let&#39;s say we extend</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:56.079" style="s2">exponential technologies the next</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">several years we say okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">so crispr biotech gene drives</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.760" end="01:00:02.640" style="s2">making it to where more and more people</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">can do really up things on</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.640" end="01:00:06.720" style="s2">smaller and smaller scales</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">the ability to do cyber warfare ai</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.720" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">nanotech whatever these types of things</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:10.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">as we see with exponential tech it</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.480" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just make exponentially more</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">it also makes the power cheaper right we</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">look at the cost of computation</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">or any of these things which also means</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">then more decentralized so it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">state actors it&#39;s non-state actors it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:25.520" style="s2">smaller and smaller groups having more</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">and more power</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s like having each cell if it</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:31.040" style="s2">mutates have the ability to affect the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">whole system too</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:35.520" style="s2">rapidly so there is no possibility for</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">anti-fragility for resilience</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.520" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">in that particular structure so if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">people who study existential risk</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">like exponential tech immediate</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2">existential risk how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:50.400" style="s2">avoid blowing ourselves up from stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:52.400" style="s2">that people are doing in their basement</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.400" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">with no exotic materials that</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.400" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">nobody can tell a very common answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">is ubiquitous surveillance</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">universal surveillance everywhere nobody</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">can be doing anything in there</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">and again we said it&#39;s when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">lack of transparency that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">problems start to happen</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">so that we can see why someone would say</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">that right is</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">we don&#39;t want somebody in their basement</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">being able to build crisper weapons</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.480" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">and yet we also don&#39;t want 1984 and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">if we have a surveillance state where</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">the state is</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">there is a structure that guarantees</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">that the state is going to move towards</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:30.480" style="s2">corruption because that&#39;s how top-down</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">power hierarchies work and you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.480" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">a power hierarchy of one-to-many power</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">structure the state has surveillance on</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">everybody everybody doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">input back to that and it&#39;s oriented to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">be captured and corrupted</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:44.480" style="s2">all right that&#39;s so that&#39;s a failed</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.400" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">system but not having that seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.480" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">failed system in the presence of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">exponential text it&#39;s like what what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2"> do we do</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">so you know you can see that even with</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:56.720" style="s2">the technology the killing technology</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">of in guns as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.720" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">knives you just can&#39;t kill as many</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:01.280" style="s2">people with a knife if you get if you go</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:04.319" style="s2">wacky right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:06.160" style="s2">when you look at mass shootings</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.319" end="01:02:07.680" style="s2">whenever we hear that somebody took an</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.160" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">ar-15 and went and shot up a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.680" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">and the news reporters go and do the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:13.680" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:15.839" style="s2">the neighbors all say yeah he was real</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.680" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">quiet he kept to himself we never heard</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.839" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">from him etc what that means is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:21.920" style="s2">person might have been progressing</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">as a cancer cell right they might have</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.920" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">been progressing in their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">psychopathology depression</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:30.720" style="s2">and upset for years with no one</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">actually engaging with them to be able</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.720" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">to see that they could go to the store</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">buy food and no one noticed</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:37.119" style="s2">if they were upset or not or healthy or</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">not in the way that they would in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">tribal</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">dynamic if you have people who can</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">isolate themselves progress in their</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.559" style="s2">psychopathology not be checked</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">and they have ar-15s you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">have those kind of shootings</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">if they have access to progress in those</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">types of isolated dynamics and they have</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">worse weapons it gets worse so what do</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">you do well you don&#39;t have to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">service</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">surveillance by the top down state</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">remember there&#39;s a top down force that</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:06.079" style="s2">happens not at the level of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">body to a cell but even a tissue to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.079" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">cell</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">and so this is like if that person was</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">part of a family and part of a tribe</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:14.160" style="s2">where they actually needed each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.559" end="01:03:15.440" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t just use this abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.160" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">called money to get their needs met</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.440" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">without having to interact with humans</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">in any meaningful way</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">the other people would see hey this</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:22.799" style="s2">person doesn&#39;t seem well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">spend more time with them and work with</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.799" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">them and help them be healthier</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.079" style="s2">so this is a kind of surveillance but</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not a top-down captured</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.079" end="01:03:31.599" style="s2">surveillance it&#39;s a mini to mini rather</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">than a one-to-many</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.599" end="01:03:34.799" style="s2">kind of system so there&#39;s a symmetry in</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">it and this</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.799" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">is a how do we</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">have more awareness of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">for everyone so that</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">we can help people actually be healthy</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">this is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">sufficient for but it&#39;s necessary for</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">choice making be our choice making basis</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">be capable of holding our choice making</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve been thinking about this for a</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.760" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">in phrasing a little bit differently but</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">but how do we restore community</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:09.200" style="s2">when we have a system that strip minds</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.200" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">because community is based on it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:14.799" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">people knowing each other but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.799" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">people depending on each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">so the economy as we know it replaces</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:27.200" style="s2">interdependency with dependency on</p>

<p begin="01:04:27.200" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">and anonymous service providers mediated</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">by a very complicated division of labor</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">when production is on such a vast</p>

<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:41.599" style="s2">of labor</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:44.079" style="s2">how can you have meaningful community</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.599" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">when all of our needs</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:48.319" style="s2">our tangible needs at least are sourced</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.319" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">and not yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.880" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">right so so one one avenue is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">relocalize</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:00.880" style="s2">and replace some of the functions that</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve handed over to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:06.000" style="s2">a global mega machine with locally met</p>

<p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s already a movement in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">direction for example the food movement</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.440" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">people are wanting to source their</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">food locally but the economic system</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">is stacked against that because of</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.400" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">externalized costs</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">mostly so lettuce shipped from</p>

<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:28.319" style="s2">to the east coast is cheaper than what</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.039" end="01:05:31.039" style="s2">it&#39;s grown here</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.319" end="01:05:33.039" style="s2">uh because of the subsidization the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.039" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">preferred subsidies embodied in roads</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.039" end="01:05:37.359" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">and the external environmental costs et</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.359" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">cetera et cetera et cetera so</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">from what you said the people who wield</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.400" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:46.319" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to change those conditions</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">because they</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.319" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">are part of the paper clip maximizer i</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">mean they</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">are their job is to maintain those</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">from which they personally benefit but</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:05:59.119" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">the paper clip maximizer benefits in his</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">and it seems that the system has only</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">strengthened its grip</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:10.000" style="s2">over the course of my lifetime and i</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">mean forever</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.000" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">so it looks like a really bleak picture</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:14.720" style="s2">you&#39;re painting here</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">like yeah we know what the solution</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.720" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">would be to restore</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">to each other to place to community</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">so that we can have informal bottom-up</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">organic surveillance or you could say</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:30.720" style="s2">transparency so that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">can identify the cancer cell before it</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.720" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">starts shooting its</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">cancer messages out to the entire world</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">before</p>

<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">unleash something horrible we know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:49.599" style="s2">we have right now we have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:50.319" style="s2">rivalrous system that compels everybody</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.599" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.319" end="01:06:54.079" style="s2">toward to enact behavior that is going</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">to destroy everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.079" end="01:06:57.680" style="s2">and we know where we want to go which</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">would be to a society</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.680" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">organized much more like a body with</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">multiple levels</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">of complex structure interacting with</p>

<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">and enabling us to be transparent</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">to the people around us in this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">nested system</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">that is non-hierarchical that has</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">uh an interplay of bottom bottom down</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">bottom up and top-down dynamics that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.039" end="01:07:27.680" style="s2">evolves toward greater and greater</p>

<p begin="01:07:27.680" end="01:07:33.359" style="s2">we know where we&#39;re going do you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.799" end="01:07:36.559" style="s2">like at least like a little</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.359" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">uh a little through line from</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.559" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">here to there like how do we take a step</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">into this transition</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.720" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">the heart of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:56.319" style="s2">is the word that you mentioned a couple</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:07:59.039" style="s2">times is power</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.319" end="01:08:00.480" style="s2">and what we&#39;re talking about is a system</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.039" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">where the primary concept</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">is not power power meaning power over or</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:07.359" style="s2">power against</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">in a rivalrous way in a game theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.359" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">where the core idea is</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">resiliency we could think of we could</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">use different terms resiliency</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">strength whatever where the goal is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.440" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">to maximize my</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.960" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">power over the environment or other</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">agents it&#39;s to maximize my sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">and my ability which includes my ability</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">to not be controlled by other agents</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">right to be anti-fragile to power</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">without actually engaging in the game of</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamentally different and kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">of critical distinction because the game</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">of power is actually the paperclip</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:44.400" style="s2">maximizer</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:45.199" style="s2">and capitalism is simply a part of it</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.400" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.199" end="01:08:48.719" style="s2">this is the key thing for us to</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:52.880" style="s2">construct so we can show what the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.719" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">alternative looks like</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.880" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">a lot of people are going to maybe be</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">thinking um</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:01.359" style="s2">daniel it seems like you missed biology</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:03.839" style="s2">class and</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how darwinian evolution</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">that these type of rivalrous behaviors</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.279" end="01:09:09.920" style="s2">are nature itself and we evolved to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:11.600" style="s2">these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.920" end="01:09:12.960" style="s2">rivalrous dynamics and you&#39;re asking for</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.600" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">something that is outside of human</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.960" end="01:09:16.000" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">or outside of nature itself this is an</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.000" end="01:09:18.640" style="s2">important point to address</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:20.159" style="s2">because i can&#39;t offer what an</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.640" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">alternative is if people think that it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.159" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">goes against</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:24.799" style="s2">what is actually possible and something</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:26.480" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.799" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">need to understand in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">nature of this situation we&#39;re in is</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.319" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">if we look at ecosystem natural systems</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:38.560" style="s2">came about through evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">there are rivalries dynamics there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.560" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">also heaps of symbiotic dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:44.080" style="s2">a lot more symbiotic dynamics and there</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">are rivalrous ones</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.080" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">um but there are rivalrous ones and</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.440" end="01:09:51.279" style="s2">they&#39;re worth pointing out</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:51.920" style="s2">but even the rivalries dynamics end up</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.279" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">driving</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.920" end="01:09:55.520" style="s2">symbiotic dynamics at a higher level and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">this is a key part that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.520" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">understand and we have kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">understood it we&#39;ve based our theory of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">markets on this idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">so you know the key example is we</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">look at competition in terms of uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:11.199" style="s2">various animals of the same species</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:13.199" style="s2">competing for reproductive opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.199" end="01:10:15.280" style="s2">and obviously predator-prey</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.199" end="01:10:16.640" style="s2">relationships being directly</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.280" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">wrist there&#39;s plenty of things that look</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.640" end="01:10:22.159" style="s2">zero sum and so we</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">look at a fox chasing a rabbit</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.159" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">and if the rabbit if the fox catches the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">rabbit the rabbit&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:29.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s pretty clearly rivalrous if</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">the rabbit gets away the fox might</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.280" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">actually starve to death or not be able</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">to feed its kids</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:35.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s a very clearly rivalrous</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.280" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.520" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">but we see that the foxes as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">species and the rabbits as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">species actually depend upon each other</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:45.520" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t even really survive</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">without each other and they&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.520" end="01:10:49.199" style="s2">each other&#39;s evolution</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">because the slowest rabbits get eaten</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.199" end="01:10:54.159" style="s2">the slowest foxes starve</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:55.199" style="s2">and don&#39;t uh don&#39;t mate the fastest of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.159" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">both get through</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.199" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">and then those genes reselect and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">rabbits are evolving and foxes are</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:02.800" style="s2">evolving because of each other and if it</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">weren&#39;t for the rabbits the foxes would</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.800" end="01:11:05.199" style="s2">have nothing to eat and if it wasn&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:06.800" style="s2">the foxes the rabbits would eat</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.199" end="01:11:08.320" style="s2">themselves to extinction</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.800" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">so we say oh this actually very</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.320" end="01:11:11.440" style="s2">interesting at</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">one-on-one interactions there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.440" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">rivalrist dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:17.960" style="s2">but it leads to a macro symbiosis so how</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:19.120" style="s2">is it that microrivalry becomes</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.960" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">macrosymbiosis</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.120" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">and the key insight there is that there</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">is a symmetry of</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:27.120" style="s2">power between the fox and the rabbit</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">between the lion and the gazelle between</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.120" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">the shark and the tuna between</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:34.239" style="s2">all these places where the prey gets</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">away as often as it gets caught</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.239" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">and or more often whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:41.520" style="s2">particular symmetry is</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.520" end="01:11:43.280" style="s2">but there is a there is actually a power</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.520" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">symmetry that has it to where that</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">dynamic between them</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:48.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have one get asymmetrically</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:51.360" style="s2">ahead of the other one so they both</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.960" end="01:11:53.360" style="s2">co-evolve as a result of that process</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.360" end="01:11:55.040" style="s2">but we could imagine if the foxes had a</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.360" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">mutation where they got a hundred times</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.040" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">faster in one generation</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:11:59.280" style="s2">that they would eat all the rabbits</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">their population would boom and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.280" end="01:12:03.840" style="s2">they&#39;d all starve to death</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:06.080" style="s2">so breaking the cemetery of power would</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.840" end="01:12:07.760" style="s2">actually break how evolution works but</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.080" end="01:12:09.280" style="s2">the symmetry of power is never broken in</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.760" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">evolution because</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:12.960" style="s2">what leads to right natural selection</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:14.719" style="s2">mutation</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.960" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">and then selection of the adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.719" end="01:12:19.440" style="s2">mutations both survival selection</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:20.400" style="s2">and sexual selection that happens the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">same everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.400" end="01:12:25.360" style="s2">right there is a distribution of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.560" end="01:12:27.120" style="s2">creates the mutation dynamics and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.360" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">um there the cemetery of power is</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.120" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">maintained as the whole</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.400" end="01:12:34.880" style="s2">system steps up</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:37.679" style="s2">until technology came about and with</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.880" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">early humans homo habilis double down</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.679" end="01:12:40.960" style="s2">and homo sapien</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:42.320" style="s2">was the beginning of a creative process</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.960" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">that was different than anything that</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.320" end="01:12:44.880" style="s2">had happened in the evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.920" end="01:12:47.760" style="s2">up to that point</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.880" end="01:12:48.159" style="s2">where we were able to increase our power</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.760" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.159" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">through the same kind of slow</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:54.560" style="s2">mutation process that was increasing it</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">on all sides</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.560" end="01:12:57.840" style="s2">in a way that actually broke the</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">symmetry of power so we could make stone</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.840" end="01:13:02.960" style="s2">tools and we could go hunt and we became</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">radically more lethal became better</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.960" end="01:13:05.920" style="s2">predators</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:06.960" style="s2">faster than the environment could adapt</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.920" end="01:13:09.679" style="s2">to our increased</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.960" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">predative capacity and so we could</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.679" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">overhunt a whole environment</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.239" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">and then not only did our tool making</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">capacity allow us to do that it also</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:19.679" style="s2">allowed us to put on</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">a skin and move into an environment that</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.679" end="01:13:23.040" style="s2">we hadn&#39;t adapted to</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:24.960" style="s2">so we could go to the arctic like polar</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.040" end="01:13:26.400" style="s2">bears in the savannah like cheetahs and</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.960" end="01:13:28.640" style="s2">like we could go everywhere and become</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.400" end="01:13:30.960" style="s2">the peak predator in every environment</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.640" end="01:13:33.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a fundamentally different deal</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.960" end="01:13:35.199" style="s2">because microrivalry leads to macro</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.520" end="01:13:37.199" style="s2">symbiosis only if there&#39;s a power</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.199" end="01:13:39.679" style="s2">symmetry if the power symmetry is broken</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.199" end="01:13:41.600" style="s2">microrivalry leads to macro rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.679" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">without bind and ends up</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:46.400" style="s2">self-terminating</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:48.640" style="s2">and so if we take evolutionary rivalrous</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.400" end="01:13:52.080" style="s2">dynamics and multiply them</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.640" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">by technology which creates increasing</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.080" end="01:13:55.199" style="s2">asymmetry and essentially exponential</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:58.320" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.199" end="01:14:00.880" style="s2">you do get a unstable system an unstable</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.320" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">oscillator it eventually breaks down so</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.880" end="01:14:05.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">of our technology the the social</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.040" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">darwinist idea that markets are</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:11.199" style="s2">basically a darwinian evolution</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:13.120" style="s2">process where different companies will</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.199" end="01:14:14.320" style="s2">create mutation on the same product and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.120" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">the one that people like will get</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.320" end="01:14:19.920" style="s2">selected via supply and demand dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">the idea actually doesn&#39;t hold in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.920" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">same way</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">because we do have the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">outstrip environments faster than they</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:27.760" style="s2">can reproduce themselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.440" end="01:14:29.600" style="s2">kill whole species whatever and if we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.760" end="01:14:30.640" style="s2">are debasing the substrate upon which we</p>

<p begin="01:14:30.640" end="01:14:34.640" style="s2">then we&#39;re self-terminating and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.120" end="01:14:38.080" style="s2">how this is happening so</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.640" end="01:14:39.199" style="s2">our tool making has given us enough</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">i&#39;m wanting to share</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">rivalrous dynamics where they occur are</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:50.480" style="s2">actually sustainable where there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:14:50.480" end="01:14:54.560" style="s2">but we have a radical asymmetry between</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.600" end="01:15:01.280" style="s2">in nature there&#39;s a symmetry between</p>

<p begin="01:17:13.679" end="01:17:18.080" style="s2">unconscious evolution of the whole right</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:19.600" style="s2">natural selection is kind of this</p>

<p begin="01:17:20.640" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">then tool making is a conscious process</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.800" end="01:17:27.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s just parts</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:28.719" style="s2">right in rivalrous relationship with</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.719" end="01:17:32.159" style="s2">the next part is conscious evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:33.040" style="s2">the whole which is really this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:35.679" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.040" end="01:17:37.520" style="s2">epoch phase and that is a fundamentally</p>

<p begin="01:17:37.520" end="01:17:40.640" style="s2">but even identity</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.719" end="01:17:43.040" style="s2">and this is where you come to why we</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.640" end="01:17:46.400" style="s2">need a new story and a new mythos where</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.040" end="01:17:46.719" style="s2">where there is no way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.400" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.719" end="01:17:50.560" style="s2">my race my nation independent of all the</p>

<p begin="01:17:50.560" end="01:17:54.080" style="s2">ecosystem because i actually don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.239" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">without them i can&#39;t and my rivalrous</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.080" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">dynamics with them will lead to</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:17:59.440" style="s2">their increased rivalrous dynamics lead</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:01.600" style="s2">to the self-termination of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.440" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2">so when you ask how does it transition i</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.600" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we have the time to get</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:06.719" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:08.719" style="s2">what is a new method of</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.719" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">collective sense making and collective</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:12.000" style="s2">choice making and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:13.360" style="s2">provisioning of resources that replaces</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.000" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">what we think of as economics and</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">governance now</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">and how do we do tool-making in a way</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:21.600" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t cause externality</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:23.760" style="s2">but culture actually has to be the first</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.600" end="01:18:27.040" style="s2">part of the transition</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.760" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">because our new social systems our new</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:30.480" style="s2">economic systems are going to require</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.719" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">new types of tool-making that mediate</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.480" end="01:18:33.840" style="s2">them in the same way that it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:35.120" style="s2">can&#39;t do cryptocurrency as an economic</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.840" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">system without a computational</p>

<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:41.199" style="s2">and you can&#39;t have stores of grain that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.920" end="01:18:43.520" style="s2">lead to capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.199" end="01:18:44.560" style="s2">or that lead to private ownership in</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.520" end="01:18:47.120" style="s2">that way before you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.560" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">plows there are tools that mediate the</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:49.760" style="s2">new type of social agreements we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:50.400" style="s2">going to have new methods of sense</p>

<p begin="01:18:50.400" end="01:18:53.840" style="s2">largely because we also have new methods</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.760" end="01:18:55.679" style="s2">of communication and</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.840" end="01:18:57.120" style="s2">information processing and computational</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.120" end="01:19:00.640" style="s2">but how to even build the tools that are</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.880" end="01:19:01.920" style="s2">oriented to that as opposed to oriented</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:03.440" style="s2">to some other purpose will be some</p>

<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:17.840" style="s2">yeah what you&#39;re saying is is so so</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.840" end="01:20:20.000" style="s2">closely congruent to</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.840" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">the things i&#39;ve been saying for years um</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.000" end="01:20:25.840" style="s2">with totally different language</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:28.480" style="s2">i speak for example of a transition</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.840" end="01:20:30.480" style="s2">from a relationship of mother earth to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.480" end="01:20:34.000" style="s2">relationship of lover earth</p>

<p begin="01:20:35.520" end="01:20:38.719" style="s2">take as best we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.280" end="01:20:40.400" style="s2">which is the proper relationship of a</p>

<p begin="01:20:40.400" end="01:20:48.560" style="s2">um but where we understand that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.239" end="01:20:52.639" style="s2">are here to give and take in</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.560" end="01:20:55.120" style="s2">in harmonious measure and perhaps to</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.639" end="01:20:56.560" style="s2">as with a lover to co-create something</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.560" end="01:21:01.440" style="s2">so that really does translate into</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.600" end="01:21:04.080" style="s2">abandoning the behavior of an apex</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.440" end="01:21:06.880" style="s2">predator and taking responsibility</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.000" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">it also means a reconception of who we</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.440" end="01:21:14.639" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.800" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">in relationship to the other in</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.639" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">relationship to nature</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:19.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a change that goes all the way to</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:23.040" style="s2">the bottom yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.840" end="01:21:24.719" style="s2">all the way to what we believe we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.040" end="01:21:26.560" style="s2">what we believe reality is and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.719" end="01:21:30.000" style="s2">relationship between us and reality</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.560" end="01:21:31.600" style="s2">because what we understand to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.000" end="01:21:33.840" style="s2">real is going to inform what we</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:36.400" style="s2">understand to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.840" end="01:21:38.719" style="s2">that is the basis for then what we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:42.000" style="s2">making choices in service to</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.719" end="01:21:45.360" style="s2">right um yeah i see it as</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">really an initiation into a different</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.360" end="01:21:50.320" style="s2">collective state of being that also then</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">induces a different personal state of</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.320" end="01:21:55.600" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">because one hallmark of an initiation</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.600" end="01:21:59.600" style="s2">is that you&#39;re faced with circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.560" style="s2">that none of your existing tools are</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.600" end="01:22:04.080" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.560" end="01:22:07.600" style="s2">to handle right and you&#39;re you&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.080" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">forced or ever be strongly invited</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.600" end="01:22:13.600" style="s2">to uh uh metamorphosize you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">grow and just to become something else i</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.600" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">mean i&#39;m not going to say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">entirely new i think that at each stage</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:21.360" style="s2">of human evolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:23.679" style="s2">like with the advent of stone tools with</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.360" end="01:22:25.600" style="s2">the advent of fire with the advent of</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.679" end="01:22:28.719" style="s2">domestication and so on</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.600" end="01:22:32.719" style="s2">like each of these qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.719" end="01:22:35.840" style="s2">step ups in the our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.719" end="01:22:38.320" style="s2">out-compete the rest of nature there was</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.840" end="01:22:40.880" style="s2">at each point the possibility of coming</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.320" end="01:22:44.000" style="s2">into a responsible</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.880" end="01:22:47.120" style="s2">equilibrium that</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.000" end="01:22:50.560" style="s2">necessitated taking some responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.120" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">and exercising some kind of restraint</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.560" end="01:22:56.880" style="s2">so there are hunter-gatherer cultures</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.920" style="s2">who and maybe some just still to this</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.880" end="01:23:00.880" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.920" end="01:23:02.320" style="s2">who really understood themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.880" end="01:23:05.199" style="s2">among other things as</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.320" end="01:23:06.159" style="s2">stewards of the land and caretakers of</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.199" end="01:23:07.760" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.159" end="01:23:10.239" style="s2">among some of the native americans for</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.760" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">example the idea of the wild</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.239" end="01:23:15.520" style="s2">was a repulsive concept</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">like no it&#39;s not the wild we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.520" end="01:23:19.600" style="s2">we&#39;re here to interact</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.280" end="01:23:20.480" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t that they left no trace it was</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.600" end="01:23:22.239" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.480" end="01:23:23.679" style="s2">interacted in a positive way and left a</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.239" end="01:23:27.040" style="s2">positive trace</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.679" end="01:23:29.199" style="s2">and there were those at each stage of</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.040" end="01:23:30.800" style="s2">our technological development that</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.199" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t take responsibility and did</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.800" end="01:23:35.280" style="s2">tremendous damage</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:36.639" style="s2">so just to say that it&#39;s not an entirely</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.280" end="01:23:38.719" style="s2">a new thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:41.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeking here there are</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.719" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">precedents for it that operated</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.040" end="01:23:47.040" style="s2">on um earlier levels of technological</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.040" end="01:23:48.239" style="s2">development you know if you can look at</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.040" end="01:23:51.280" style="s2">technology it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.239" end="01:23:53.840" style="s2">a step up function where you had a</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.280" end="01:23:55.840" style="s2">sudden leap and then maybe a gradual</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.840" end="01:23:57.199" style="s2">increase then another sudden leap and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.840" end="01:23:59.199" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.199" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">you know there so there were stone age</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.199" end="01:24:02.960" style="s2">cultures that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:03.920" style="s2">lived in equilibrium there were agrarian</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.960" end="01:24:05.840" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.920" end="01:24:07.120" style="s2">that lived in equilibrium equilibrium</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.840" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">and maintained</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.120" end="01:24:11.199" style="s2">ecological symbiosis for thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.520" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.199" end="01:24:14.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure if we could say the</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.520" end="01:24:18.239" style="s2">same for industrial</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.960" end="01:24:20.400" style="s2">societies let alone digital societies</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.239" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">but just saying that there are</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.400" end="01:24:23.679" style="s2">precedents</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">and cultural memories that we might be</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.679" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">able to draw on</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">as we forge a story that locates us</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:35.679" style="s2">in a different relationship to nature</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.600" end="01:24:37.600" style="s2">yeah i think i think it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.679" end="01:24:39.199" style="s2">because we&#39;re definitely not going</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.600" end="01:24:42.560" style="s2">backwards right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.199" end="01:24:44.400" style="s2">moving to a society that is both higher</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.560" end="01:24:45.679" style="s2">touch and higher nature as well as</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.400" end="01:24:47.679" style="s2">higher tech</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.679" end="01:24:48.800" style="s2">but a fundamentally different way of</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.679" end="01:24:52.080" style="s2">thinking about what</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.800" end="01:24:55.120" style="s2">technology is and what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.080" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">what it&#39;s for um</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.120" end="01:24:59.040" style="s2">and so any orientation to say it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:00.239" style="s2">good before let&#39;s go back we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.040" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.239" end="01:25:04.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of principles that</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve had in various previous phases</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:09.520" style="s2">that are actually a critical part of it</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.480" end="01:25:11.440" style="s2">and so you know one one thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.520" end="01:25:13.600" style="s2">to what you said is that of course there</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.440" end="01:25:13.920" style="s2">is a distribution of cultures that were</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.600" end="01:25:16.960" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.920" end="01:25:18.480" style="s2">more harmonious with their environment</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.960" end="01:25:21.600" style="s2">versus more exploitive</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.480" end="01:25:23.679" style="s2">uh less warring versus more worrying and</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.600" end="01:25:25.120" style="s2">in general the way the curve goes is</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.679" end="01:25:26.560" style="s2">that the more warring culture is killed</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.120" end="01:25:27.360" style="s2">the less boring cultures at a certain</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.560" end="01:25:28.560" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.360" end="01:25:31.120" style="s2">and the ones that exploited the</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.560" end="01:25:32.560" style="s2">environments have been ended up</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.120" end="01:25:34.320" style="s2">taking over the ones that didn&#39;t at a</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.560" end="01:25:37.440" style="s2">certain point and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.320" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">we can see that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.440" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">the only cultures that were kind of that</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:43.360" style="s2">were more</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:44.880" style="s2">peaceful that were left for a while was</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.360" end="01:25:46.159" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t have natural resource</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.880" end="01:25:47.679" style="s2">they weren&#39;t a threat they were in some</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.159" end="01:25:49.440" style="s2">far away place like tibet</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.679" end="01:25:51.600" style="s2">until tibet actually became a threat</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.440" end="01:25:53.600" style="s2">because you know things like</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.600" end="01:25:54.880" style="s2">modern media where its message could</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.600" end="01:25:56.719" style="s2">damage the message</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.880" end="01:25:58.239" style="s2">of china to the rest of the world and</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.719" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">then it had to be taken out and we could</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.239" end="01:26:01.199" style="s2">see that with patriarchal versus</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:03.920" style="s2">matriarchal cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.199" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">you know greece falling to rome and all</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.920" end="01:26:07.679" style="s2">those types of things</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.679" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">and yet so what we&#39;re looking at is in</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.679" end="01:26:13.920" style="s2">those phases</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:17.280" style="s2">doing the more power dominant thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.920" end="01:26:20.000" style="s2">won not doing it lost by default</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.280" end="01:26:20.560" style="s2">and so the power dominant thing both</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.000" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.560" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">and was compulsory right</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:27.920" style="s2">now the power dominant thing has got to</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:29.840" style="s2">a high enough level of power</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.920" end="01:26:31.360" style="s2">that increasing the level of power on</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.840" end="01:26:33.040" style="s2">all sides is actually what is breaking</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.360" end="01:26:35.199" style="s2">the underlying substrate itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.040" end="01:26:37.520" style="s2">and so it no longer can keep winning the</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.199" end="01:26:39.840" style="s2">thing that has won so far the winning</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.520" end="01:26:41.440" style="s2">in win lose itself is now the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.840" end="01:26:43.199" style="s2">threat to survival</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.440" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">and so when you say we need new tools we</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.199" end="01:26:46.719" style="s2">actually need new meta tools we need a</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.719" end="01:26:49.040" style="s2">meta process by which we aren&#39;t trying</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.719" end="01:26:50.080" style="s2">to create a situation that selects for</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.040" end="01:26:52.320" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.080" end="01:26:53.840" style="s2">against others because that againstness</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.320" end="01:26:55.520" style="s2">itself will actually break the ability</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.840" end="01:26:57.360" style="s2">to even select for us</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.520" end="01:26:59.280" style="s2">and so of course there have been lots of</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.360" end="01:27:00.880" style="s2">epochs with the agricultural revolution</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.280" end="01:27:02.320" style="s2">industrial revolution and there were</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.880" end="01:27:04.080" style="s2">major changes</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.320" end="01:27:05.440" style="s2">but i would say the epoch that we are on</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.080" end="01:27:06.000" style="s2">the brink of that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.440" end="01:27:08.400" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.000" end="01:27:09.199" style="s2">is like maybe the last time that</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.400" end="01:27:11.760" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.199" end="01:27:13.760" style="s2">of this magnitude happened was homo</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.760" end="01:27:15.280" style="s2">habilis and tool making</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.760" end="01:27:17.120" style="s2">because you know we said like okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.280" end="01:27:18.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got evolution it&#39;s a very old</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.120" end="01:27:19.600" style="s2">process depending</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.000" end="01:27:21.040" style="s2">on how we want to define it billions of</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.600" end="01:27:22.239" style="s2">years on this earth or as old as the</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.040" end="01:27:24.800" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.239" end="01:27:27.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s a mathematical process that</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.800" end="01:27:31.040" style="s2">just kept happening for a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.440" end="01:27:33.760" style="s2">until tool making created a conscious</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.040" end="01:27:34.560" style="s2">central serial rather than unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.760" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">decentral</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.560" end="01:27:38.800" style="s2">parallel creative process and then there</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:40.639" style="s2">have been a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.800" end="01:27:41.920" style="s2">epochal shifts in how we do the tool</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.639" end="01:27:43.760" style="s2">making thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.920" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">but we&#39;re really looking at a new third</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.760" end="01:27:46.000" style="s2">creative process that is neither</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.440" end="01:27:47.679" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.000" end="01:27:49.360" style="s2">nor tool making it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.679" end="01:27:50.080" style="s2">navigates the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.360" end="01:27:53.280" style="s2">both of them</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.080" end="01:27:54.719" style="s2">it&#39;s a conscious right creation of holes</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.280" end="01:27:56.639" style="s2">rather than an unconscious creation of</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.719" end="01:27:59.120" style="s2">holes or consecration of parts</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.639" end="01:28:00.080" style="s2">so i would say that that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.120" end="01:28:03.040" style="s2">meta epoch</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.080" end="01:28:03.679" style="s2">that we have not had a transition like</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.040" end="01:28:06.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.679" end="01:28:08.960" style="s2">in the history of our species</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.719" end="01:28:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s very that&#39;s very interesting i</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.960" end="01:28:13.920" style="s2">agree with that i think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.480" end="01:28:14.400" style="s2">um what we face is qualitatively</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.920" end="01:28:16.239" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.400" end="01:28:17.679" style="s2">than any of the technological</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.239" end="01:28:19.520" style="s2">revolutions before</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.679" end="01:28:20.719" style="s2">it&#39;s bigger than the neolithic</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.520" end="01:28:22.320" style="s2">revolution it&#39;s bigger than the</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.719" end="01:28:23.679" style="s2">industrial revolution</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.320" end="01:28:25.760" style="s2">because all of those were an</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.679" end="01:28:27.760" style="s2">intensification of</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.760" end="01:28:29.520" style="s2">something that was already in progress</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.760" end="01:28:32.000" style="s2">right it was a</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.520" end="01:28:33.760" style="s2">next level of the development of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.000" end="01:28:36.239" style="s2">technologies of control</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.760" end="01:28:36.960" style="s2">and this is something entirely different</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.239" end="01:28:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.960" end="01:28:41.760" style="s2">a bigger and deeper qualitatively</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.400" end="01:28:42.639" style="s2">different kind of revolution than</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.760" end="01:28:45.199" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.639" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had before but every religion</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.199" end="01:28:48.800" style="s2">spoke to it or</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.719" style="s2">in the most part most religions spoke to</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.800" end="01:28:52.080" style="s2">something like this with the what is</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.719" end="01:28:54.480" style="s2">happening at the end of the mayan</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.080" end="01:28:56.239" style="s2">calendar or the end of kali yuga and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.480" end="01:28:58.960" style="s2">emergence of satyuga in</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.239" end="01:28:59.600" style="s2">the hindu system or the you know the end</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.960" end="01:29:01.679" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.600" end="01:29:03.199" style="s2">the end of times and purgatory and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.679" end="01:29:06.159" style="s2">heaven or hell if we take these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.199" end="01:29:09.280" style="s2">metaphorically we say</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.159" end="01:29:12.320" style="s2">let&#39;s just play with the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.280" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">rapture story in christianity was just</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.320" end="01:29:16.320" style="s2">kind of like patient people looking and</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:19.199" style="s2">saying hey</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.320" end="01:29:20.000" style="s2">as we went from stone tools to metal</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.199" end="01:29:22.000" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.000" end="01:29:23.280" style="s2">and as we keep developing better and</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.000" end="01:29:25.280" style="s2">better tools</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.280" end="01:29:26.560" style="s2">we&#39;re destroying environments faster</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.280" end="01:29:27.840" style="s2">than we were there are deserts where</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.560" end="01:29:29.120" style="s2">there didn&#39;t used to be and the wars are</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.840" end="01:29:32.159" style="s2">getting bigger</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.120" end="01:29:33.840" style="s2">and they can just imagine that that</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.159" end="01:29:35.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get to go on forever</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.840" end="01:29:37.600" style="s2">at a certain point we become too</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.520" end="01:29:39.679" style="s2">powerful to keep being that dumb</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.600" end="01:29:42.080" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a story that says this</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.679" end="01:29:43.679" style="s2">phase that we&#39;re in comes to an end</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.080" end="01:29:45.440" style="s2">we fell out of the garden in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.679" end="01:29:47.120" style="s2">how to live in harmony with things</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.440" end="01:29:48.880" style="s2">this phase comes to an end there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.120" end="01:29:50.960" style="s2">purgatory where there&#39;s some really hard</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.880" end="01:29:52.719" style="s2">reckoning with the choices we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.960" end="01:29:54.080" style="s2">and we either go a very different</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.719" end="01:29:55.600" style="s2">direction where we kind of are</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.080" end="01:29:56.480" style="s2">reintroduced to the garden but at a</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.600" end="01:29:59.600" style="s2">higher order</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.480" end="01:30:01.360" style="s2">or it or it&#39;s pretty bleak yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.600" end="01:30:03.679" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a literally true story</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.360" end="01:30:06.080" style="s2">and we&#39;re just in purgatory now</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.679" end="01:30:06.719" style="s2">we&#39;re actually in that eminent place</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.080" end="01:30:09.360" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.719" end="01:30:11.040" style="s2">the choices we&#39;ve been making have to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.360" end="01:30:12.239" style="s2">not not only do we have to shift them we</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.040" end="01:30:14.080" style="s2">actually have to make amends we have to</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.239" end="01:30:15.520" style="s2">do reparations on those</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.080" end="01:30:17.280" style="s2">choices which is how do we actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.520" end="01:30:19.040" style="s2">clean the oceans not just polluting them</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.280" end="01:30:22.080" style="s2">and fix the topsoil and</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:24.080" style="s2">those types of things and so i think it</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.080" end="01:30:25.920" style="s2">is like you know people can get</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.080" end="01:30:28.239" style="s2">despairing or overwhelmed they could</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.920" end="01:30:30.719" style="s2">also be like this is the most</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.239" end="01:30:32.960" style="s2">interesting possible time to get to</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.719" end="01:30:36.639" style="s2">contribute to a deeper level shift</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.960" end="01:30:38.000" style="s2">of how for the future of all life</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.639" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">than anyone has ever had the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.000" end="01:30:42.320" style="s2">to contribute to and to just be like</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.320" end="01:30:43.600" style="s2">even if i don&#39;t know how to do it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.320" end="01:30:46.159" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.600" end="01:30:47.600" style="s2">commit to do it before i know how and</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.159" end="01:30:49.760" style="s2">start increasing</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.600" end="01:30:50.719" style="s2">my understanding and sense making so i</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.760" end="01:30:53.120" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.719" end="01:30:55.120" style="s2">more and more deeply engage right we may</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.120" end="01:30:57.679" style="s2">not know the answers but at least</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.120" end="01:30:58.159" style="s2">maybe we know the question you know we</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.679" end="01:30:59.840" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.159" end="01:31:01.360" style="s2">the direction we want to go and i think</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.840" end="01:31:03.440" style="s2">you just named it it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.360" end="01:31:04.560" style="s2">as reparations you know regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.440" end="01:31:07.440" style="s2">healing</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.560" end="01:31:09.360" style="s2">um what i mean this is the question i i</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.440" end="01:31:11.920" style="s2">ask you know knowing that</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.360" end="01:31:14.239" style="s2">no species on earth is given superfluous</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.920" end="01:31:16.080" style="s2">or unnecessary gifts</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.239" end="01:31:17.840" style="s2">that don&#39;t contribute to the well-being</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.080" end="01:31:19.520" style="s2">and evolution of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.840" end="01:31:21.199" style="s2">um the question is well what are our</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.520" end="01:31:23.600" style="s2">gifts for</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.199" end="01:31:25.760" style="s2">and maybe for the next 500 years they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.600" end="01:31:27.360" style="s2">for healing the damage that&#39;s been done</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.760" end="01:31:29.760" style="s2">after that they&#39;re probably for</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.360" end="01:31:33.199" style="s2">something else that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.760" end="01:31:33.520" style="s2">unimaginable and and who knows you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.199" end="01:31:35.360" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.520" end="01:31:36.800" style="s2">why we&#39;re really here why we really have</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.360" end="01:31:40.080" style="s2">this ability to</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.800" end="01:31:42.239" style="s2">to forge exponential technology to enact</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.080" end="01:31:44.639" style="s2">this new kind of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.239" end="01:31:46.560" style="s2">who knows why but for the next few</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.639" end="01:31:49.440" style="s2">centuries i think it&#39;s pretty clear</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.560" end="01:31:52.000" style="s2">what we&#39;re here for and uh for the time</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.440" end="01:31:55.760" style="s2">being that&#39;s good enough for me</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.000" end="01:31:58.000" style="s2">yep agreed so i think like we have um</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.760" end="01:31:59.360" style="s2">we got to a point this is like maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.000" end="01:32:01.920" style="s2">good stopping point</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.360" end="01:32:03.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve really laid the foundation of</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.920" end="01:32:05.840" style="s2">here&#39;s what needs to happen</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.360" end="01:32:07.360" style="s2">here&#39;s the question to ask you know we</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.840" end="01:32:11.679" style="s2">can do this again and</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.360" end="01:32:13.600" style="s2">talk about more of of the how</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.679" end="01:32:15.360" style="s2">i&#39;ll say one brief thing on the how-to</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.600" end="01:32:17.280" style="s2">just so that those who are really paying</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.360" end="01:32:18.880" style="s2">attention can be thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.280" end="01:32:21.040" style="s2">if the paperclip maximizer that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.880" end="01:32:25.520" style="s2">currently have is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.040" end="01:32:28.880" style="s2">collective intelligence system that is</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.520" end="01:32:32.320" style="s2">working on humans as</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.880" end="01:32:34.239" style="s2">the processors um predisposing them in</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.320" end="01:32:35.920" style="s2">particular ways etc</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.239" end="01:32:37.760" style="s2">but it is a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.920" end="01:32:39.360" style="s2">system that is oriented in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.760" end="01:32:40.880" style="s2">way and getting better</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.360" end="01:32:42.560" style="s2">the answer is a new collective</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.880" end="01:32:43.840" style="s2">intelligence system</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.560" end="01:32:46.320" style="s2">that is oriented in a different</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.840" end="01:32:47.440" style="s2">direction that is actually in service to</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.320" end="01:32:49.360" style="s2">evolution itself</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.440" end="01:32:51.679" style="s2">increasing orderly complexity rather</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.360" end="01:32:55.120" style="s2">than paper clip maximizing</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.679" end="01:32:57.040" style="s2">and yet that also has the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.120" end="01:32:58.719" style="s2">not just move in a direction but</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.040" end="01:33:00.159" style="s2">increase its intelligence and compa</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.719" end="01:33:02.080" style="s2">and capacity move in that direction so</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.159" end="01:33:03.840" style="s2">we want to be thinking about how could</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.080" end="01:33:05.840" style="s2">we have a fundamentally different kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.840" end="01:33:07.920" style="s2">of collective intelligence which is not</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.840" end="01:33:09.760" style="s2">just individual intelligence how do we</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.920" end="01:33:12.719" style="s2">have humans interacting</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.760" end="01:33:15.920" style="s2">with each other in ways that produces</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.719" end="01:33:19.040" style="s2">system disposition that orients itself</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.920" end="01:33:21.280" style="s2">in the evolutionary direction and</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.040" end="01:33:22.560" style="s2">increases its capacity to do that and</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.280" end="01:33:24.000" style="s2">yes maybe we can have a future</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.560" end="01:33:25.600" style="s2">conversation where we dive into that</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.000" end="01:33:27.840" style="s2">more but if people are thinking on it</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.600" end="01:33:30.719" style="s2">that&#39;s a good area to be thinking in</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.840" end="01:33:32.400" style="s2">yeah it would have a system component</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.719" end="01:33:35.440" style="s2">and a story component</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.400" end="01:33:36.960" style="s2">or a psychology component because</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.440" end="01:33:38.719" style="s2">the system creates the individual an</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.960" end="01:33:40.080" style="s2">individual creates the system</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.719" end="01:33:41.840" style="s2">you know and like like you can try to</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.080" end="01:33:43.280" style="s2">hold a story of</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.840" end="01:33:45.679" style="s2">inter-being you know is the word i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.280" end="01:33:46.880" style="s2">like to use for it but we live in a</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.679" end="01:33:49.520" style="s2">system that</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.880" end="01:33:50.560" style="s2">every day in a million ways enforces</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.520" end="01:33:53.600" style="s2">separation</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.560" end="01:33:54.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s really hard to live from inter</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.600" end="01:33:56.719" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.480" end="01:33:58.480" style="s2">and we could have a system that invites</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.719" end="01:34:02.080" style="s2">us and supports us in being</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.480" end="01:34:04.639" style="s2">cooperative and transparent and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.080" end="01:34:07.199" style="s2">so we can work on many many levels i</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.639" end="01:34:09.679" style="s2">think the systems level and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.199" end="01:34:10.800" style="s2">individual level and that to me points</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.679" end="01:34:16.239" style="s2">to a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.800" end="01:34:20.080" style="s2">convergence of activism and spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.239" end="01:34:22.159" style="s2">right and i would say for people who</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.080" end="01:34:23.920" style="s2">want to figure out okay well how do how</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.159" end="01:34:25.840" style="s2">do i take these very macro topics and</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.920" end="01:34:27.920" style="s2">apply them to myself in the near term if</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.840" end="01:34:29.040" style="s2">i really care and i&#39;m earnest and i say</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.920" end="01:34:30.320" style="s2">okay well there is a collective</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.040" end="01:34:32.639" style="s2">intelligence that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.320" end="01:34:34.960" style="s2">predisposing even my action</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.639" end="01:34:36.800" style="s2">facebook is moving me in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.960" end="01:34:39.280" style="s2">direction capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.800" end="01:34:40.159" style="s2">state and etc actually have an influence</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.280" end="01:34:41.760" style="s2">on me</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.159" end="01:34:43.280" style="s2">i want to evolve to where i can actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.760" end="01:34:45.040" style="s2">be part of an influence on the whole</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.280" end="01:34:46.960" style="s2">that is in a different direction</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.040" end="01:34:48.000" style="s2">but in order to increase my ability to</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.960" end="01:34:48.800" style="s2">influence the whole in a positive</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.000" end="01:34:50.639" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.800" end="01:34:52.400" style="s2">i also need to decrease the way the</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.639" end="01:34:54.400" style="s2">current system is influencing me</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.400" end="01:34:56.320" style="s2">and have things around me that are</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.400" end="01:34:58.320" style="s2">influencing me in a direction that i</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.320" end="01:35:00.400" style="s2">want so how do i create</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.320" end="01:35:03.199" style="s2">collective intelligence that i&#39;m a part</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.400" end="01:35:05.280" style="s2">of that is continuing to</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.199" end="01:35:06.639" style="s2">uh support my own sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.280" end="01:35:07.280" style="s2">sense-making and orient me in the right</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.639" end="01:35:09.840" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.280" end="01:35:11.119" style="s2">and i would say the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.840" end="01:35:14.159" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.119" end="01:35:16.159" style="s2">find people that are also really</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.159" end="01:35:18.639" style="s2">earnestly exploring these topics</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.159" end="01:35:20.159" style="s2">and not ones that all agree with you but</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.639" end="01:35:22.960" style="s2">are earnestly exploring them</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.159" end="01:35:25.199" style="s2">and you can create higher quality</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.960" end="01:35:26.800" style="s2">conversations with more regularity where</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.199" end="01:35:30.320" style="s2">the space that you are in</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.800" end="01:35:32.400" style="s2">is a space of earnest high quality</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.320" end="01:35:33.920" style="s2">exploration across a diversity of points</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.400" end="01:35:36.400" style="s2">of view</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.920" end="01:35:37.679" style="s2">you will be moved in the right direction</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.400" end="01:35:40.880" style="s2">better than if you leave</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.679" end="01:35:42.000" style="s2">the input to your brain largely to those</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.880" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">who are doing broadcast</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.000" end="01:35:45.679" style="s2">media continuously trying to control the</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.840" end="01:35:49.040" style="s2">input to your brain</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.679" end="01:35:52.159" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s uh very</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.040" end="01:35:54.000" style="s2">attractive advice for me</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.159" end="01:35:56.159" style="s2">validates the direction i&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.000" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">of course i could just be rebelling</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.159" end="01:36:00.880" style="s2">against my father or something</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.840" end="01:36:03.040" style="s2">and rejecting the information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.880" end="01:36:04.239" style="s2">that&#39;s being fed to me by the structures</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.040" end="01:36:07.199" style="s2">of power but</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.239" end="01:36:07.199" style="s2">if so so be it</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.280" end="01:36:11.440" style="s2">hey i want to say um briefly people who</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.679" end="01:36:13.679" style="s2">are interested in this dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.440" end="01:36:15.440" style="s2">you know um you&#39;re charles mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.679" end="01:36:17.760" style="s2">lewis mumford and i&#39;m sure he has</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.440" end="01:36:18.480" style="s2">a list on the site of recommended</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.760" end="01:36:20.480" style="s2">reading</p>

<p begin="01:36:21.920" end="01:36:25.119" style="s2">i didn&#39;t come up with in really any of</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.520" end="01:36:27.280" style="s2">the ideas that i&#39;m saying i</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.119" end="01:36:28.960" style="s2">at most are kind of kind of synthesizing</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.280" end="01:36:29.920" style="s2">them but their ideas coming from bucky</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.960" end="01:36:32.159" style="s2">fuller and</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.920" end="01:36:33.600" style="s2">barber marks hubbard and krishnamurti</p>

<p begin="01:36:33.600" end="01:36:37.280" style="s2">and others that are worth looking at and</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.920" end="01:36:39.520" style="s2">specifically some of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.280" end="01:36:41.199" style="s2">some of the structures regarding</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.520" end="01:36:42.239" style="s2">evolution as a creative process and then</p>

<p begin="01:36:45.360" end="01:36:48.960" style="s2">process will be and uh the distinctions</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.400" end="01:36:52.400" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.960" end="01:36:53.760" style="s2">power and strength and have come largely</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.400" end="01:36:54.080" style="s2">that a lot of brilliant structures have</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.760" end="01:36:57.600" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.080" end="01:37:00.400" style="s2">through a collaboration with a a</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.600" end="01:37:01.520" style="s2">friend of mine named forrest landry and</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.400" end="01:37:03.280" style="s2">he goes into those</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.520" end="01:37:04.880" style="s2">structures in a lot more formal detail</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.280" end="01:37:07.199" style="s2">in some of his writing so i&#39;d encourage</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.880" end="01:37:10.239" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s interested to look that up</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.199" end="01:37:12.960" style="s2">and um just a</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.239" end="01:37:13.360" style="s2">you know a little bit on resources and</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.960" end="01:37:15.440" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.360" end="01:37:16.719" style="s2">if people are interested and questions</p>

<p begin="01:37:16.719" end="01:37:19.520" style="s2">dialogue to explore those further that</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.159" end="01:37:21.199" style="s2">would be really fun</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.520" end="01:37:23.679" style="s2">and you said you had a blog or something</p>
