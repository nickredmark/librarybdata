<p begin="00:00:02.190" end="00:00:08.309" style="s2">about Star Trek and I have some thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.290" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">um would you like to go first or I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">go first you go ahead all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:18.710" style="s2">watched Star Trek a lot when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">little kid because my dad watched it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.710" end="00:00:22.410" style="s2">I haven&#39;t watched the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:24.060" style="s2">since then I&#39;ve watched a few of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.410" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">other ones</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.060" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">what&#39;s the newer one the newest was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">Voyager another part of the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">discovery oh I haven&#39;t seen that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">apparently it&#39;s terrible I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">mind it but it&#39;s always interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">you have something that&#39;s in the future</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s like the prequel cuz it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">both more technological than the 90s one</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:47.899" style="s2">less technological it&#39;s like wait you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">guys are just discovering warp drive and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.899" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">I mean I like fantasy ones but watching</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">the next generation specifically I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">watched season one and then I just</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">finished watching the one that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">being brought up about addiction the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:05.580" style="s2">holodeck one and I find it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s both ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.580" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">its time and now 20 years later way</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">behind the times like the amount of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">can tell they&#39;re trying they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">to say we&#39;ve kind of gotten over racism</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">and sexism and and ableism and yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">they&#39;ve been no way gotten past any of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">that like every like there&#39;s a one</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">planet where there were their tans and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">blondes it like fit they they have like</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">Geordi the only reason he&#39;s kind of seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">like his his disability has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">enhanced so he&#39;s he&#39;s seen as having now</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">being a contributor but not in and of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">the fact that he has a disability right</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">and they constantly mean everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">conform to their way of thinking like on</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">the enterprise itself it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">authoritarian and I get that it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:52.710" style="s2">after the military but we&#39;ve like</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">changed the military into something else</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.710" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">but yet they haven&#39;t like it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">even the fact where they will what does</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">it call the military but they like take</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">you out of one assignment and put you in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">another assignment like deploy you they</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">do that and I&#39;m like there&#39;s no how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">you have a crew when that&#39;s going on how</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">do you you know made it like it&#39;s I feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">like we would have evolved past</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">I gotten to the point where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:19.530" style="s2">here more voluntary right more like hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">we really need people who have these</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.530" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">skills who wants to come and do it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:24.989" style="s2">rather than a central authority</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:29.519" style="s2">dictating where everyone goes I do think</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.989" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">having leadership is important and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.519" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">would still necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:33.480" style="s2">organizations that have strict</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">leadership and hierarchy especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:38.549" style="s2">things that would be like the military</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">but not in the way that it is like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.549" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">feel like Picard&#39;s leadership style is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:47.549" style="s2">very behind the times now like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:49.049" style="s2">he gets angry so fast and he is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.549" end="00:02:51.569" style="s2">actually very diplomatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.049" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">and yet he&#39;s looked at as the epitome of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.569" end="00:02:57.690" style="s2">those things within the Trekkie universe</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:03:01.310" style="s2">are you talking about the new show oh no</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.690" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">I just watched the first that one was</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.310" end="00:03:07.349" style="s2">the next generation you&#39;re saying he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:09.209" style="s2">still kind of patriarchal in the past in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.349" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">the old show even though it&#39;s in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.209" end="00:03:15.569" style="s2">of positive sense yeah yeah and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:18.600" style="s2">um in the primary directive I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.569" end="00:03:21.150" style="s2">is both like even the fact they go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:23.819" style="s2">places that don&#39;t yet have spacefaring</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.150" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">is against the prime directive like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.819" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">are you doing but then they won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:31.049" style="s2">involved including when they kind of ask</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:32.609" style="s2">for it it&#39;s a very like wishy-washy like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.049" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">we&#39;re here and we know better but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.609" end="00:03:37.889" style="s2">can&#39;t pretend we know better and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.209" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">going to break the prime directive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.889" end="00:03:41.669" style="s2">every opportunity for a plot device I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">really love the Star Trek and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.669" end="00:03:46.049" style="s2">currency they&#39;ve gotten rid of currency</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:47.849" style="s2">but they really have not like the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.049" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">designing the show haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.849" end="00:03:51.620" style="s2">figured out what it means to not have</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">currency including like when they</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.620" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">there&#39;s one episode in particular where</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">there&#39;s both like this species are like</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">they&#39;re one of the planets creates a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">drug and the other ones addicted to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">drug but they think they have the plague</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">and like they can just manufacture the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:11.880" style="s2">drug they could just give them anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:13.530" style="s2">and they&#39;re like well you know no that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2">would be against the prime directive and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.530" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">they have to figure this out because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.760" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">other ones that reliance on them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:21.030" style="s2">like really this seems like a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s not even on one planet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.030" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">like one planet preying off another</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">planet and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:27.720" style="s2">if they I don&#39;t know like a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s of course my bias in it and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.720" end="00:04:35.639" style="s2">bringing you know that yes baby but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:41.370" style="s2">also portrayed the attics in a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.639" end="00:04:42.599" style="s2">addict nineties way and not in a and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.370" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">one that I just watched which was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.599" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">holodeck one where it&#39;s like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:49.380" style="s2">addicted to the holodeck but he has he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:51.479" style="s2">like has a queer quirky personality and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.380" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">yet they have not accepted him in any</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.479" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">way they&#39;re like you need to get over</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:57.060" style="s2">your instead of like society</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">accepting people for who they are and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.060" end="00:05:02.699" style="s2">really hope 300 years in the future</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">we&#39;ve embraced our diversity we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.699" end="00:05:06.599" style="s2">cuz you&#39;re an oddball it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.110" end="00:05:09.270" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you know an oddball and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.599" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">excluded that we can embrace all of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.270" end="00:05:14.099" style="s2">oddball lists and and find that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">beauty in it and so that was more than</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.099" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">five minutes I think or just five</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">minutes they&#39;re perfect what have you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:24.710" style="s2">say oh wow I&#39;ve lots of ideas but I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:27.810" style="s2">to pick up off your last point because</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.710" end="00:05:29.729" style="s2">you know the the next generation is set</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.810" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">on the Starship Enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.729" end="00:05:33.599" style="s2">right so there is certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:36.630" style="s2">expectations for crew that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.599" end="00:05:38.759" style="s2">reasonable there&#39;s a kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.630" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">just assumption that in the Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.759" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">world of course there&#39;s a place for</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">everybody somewhere you know there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">these planets with just ordinary people</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:48.710" style="s2">living on that that&#39;s when we come into</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">contact with this sort of you know or</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.710" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">ordinary people I don&#39;t mean that in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:54.659" style="s2">pejorative way but just people that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.630" style="s2">not Starfleet right so with with</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.659" end="00:06:01.259" style="s2">Berkeley and his different anxieties and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.630" end="00:06:04.349" style="s2">and addictions they they want him to</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.349" end="00:06:10.860" style="s2">not because it&#39;s a kind of authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:14.759" style="s2">cult but because it&#39;s you know it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.530" end="00:06:22.590" style="s2">with each other and so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.280" end="00:06:25.289" style="s2">it&#39;s the the aesthetic and that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.590" end="00:06:27.630" style="s2">atmosphere of the of the enterprise in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.289" end="00:06:31.080" style="s2">next generation that really captivates</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.630" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">me because it&#39;s like it&#39;s just so such a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:37.110" style="s2">calming environment you know it&#39;s got</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.110" end="00:06:44.640" style="s2">and otherwise and it&#39;s just like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.080" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">not like the other Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.640" end="00:06:47.640" style="s2">incarnations or any other science</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">fiction where there&#39;s lots of warfare</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.640" end="00:06:51.270" style="s2">and explode explosions and fights and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:54.380" style="s2">stuff like that the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.270" end="00:07:00.690" style="s2">tries to to tame it all down right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.380" end="00:07:02.520" style="s2">so you know we need to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.690" end="00:07:07.380" style="s2">these are just shows written by people</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.520" end="00:07:10.410" style="s2">very imaginative people but but but by</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.380" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">that measure the next generation stands</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.410" end="00:07:18.530" style="s2">out so much compared to the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:22.320" style="s2">versions it&#39;s just so there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.530" end="00:07:25.260" style="s2">like compassion and and thoughts behind</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.320" end="00:07:30.660" style="s2">it to imagine this this what-if kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.260" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">scenario of you know if if we have peace</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.660" end="00:07:33.870" style="s2">and if we have a spacefaring</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">civilization like what what how would it</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.870" end="00:07:39.090" style="s2">play out what would it look like and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:42.420" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to the kind of paradox</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.090" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">you noted about how you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.420" end="00:07:47.460" style="s2">based on military traditions but more</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:50.550" style="s2">specifically it&#39;s based on like naval</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.460" end="00:07:53.490" style="s2">traditions right they they they take a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.550" end="00:07:56.670" style="s2">lot of that language you know captain</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:08:00.140" style="s2">and you know portside and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.670" end="00:08:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s all naval kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.140" end="00:08:05.060" style="s2">terminology and of course that in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.880" end="00:08:08.940" style="s2">truth that&#39;s associated with you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.060" end="00:08:13.230" style="s2">conquest and imperialism and colonialism</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.940" end="00:08:18.120" style="s2">and all these things um and the show</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.230" end="00:08:20.250" style="s2">tries to you know treat human history as</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.120" end="00:08:22.530" style="s2">something like they don&#39;t whitewash it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.250" end="00:08:25.620" style="s2">they try to treat it as something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.530" end="00:08:28.470" style="s2">was very primitive and vicious right</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:32.729" style="s2">there in the 24th century looking back</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.470" end="00:08:34.170" style="s2">at the 20th century as something pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.729" end="00:08:37.500" style="s2">pretty vicious you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.170" end="00:08:42.390" style="s2">looking back necessarily at like slavery</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.500" end="00:08:43.860" style="s2">in the 17th century they will sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.390" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">but more specifically it&#39;s always about</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.860" end="00:08:50.300" style="s2">reference to our present time the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:50.300" style="s2">century so</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.970" end="00:08:58.370" style="s2">you know and so when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:59.540" style="s2">next generation juxtaposed with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.370" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">other Star Trek&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.540" end="00:09:05.420" style="s2">there&#39;s so there&#39;s so much going on in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:08.570" style="s2">terms of like I like like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.420" end="00:09:12.290" style="s2">how its corporate funded what writers</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.570" end="00:09:15.110" style="s2">are selected you know what what they</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.290" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">think fans want and that&#39;s why the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.110" end="00:09:21.830" style="s2">new JJ Abrams series of Star Trek films</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:23.300" style="s2">and even the next-generation theatrical</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.830" end="00:09:26.930" style="s2">films they&#39;re like they&#39;re just very II</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.300" end="00:09:30.350" style="s2">you know popcorn style like tons of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.930" end="00:09:34.040" style="s2">explosions tons of fights tons of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.350" end="00:09:41.750" style="s2">fast-paced action and it seduces us all</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.040" end="00:09:45.980" style="s2">away from that very very boring you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.750" end="00:09:51.020" style="s2">diplomacy a driven ethic in the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.980" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">generation um and I think like your your</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.020" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">critiques are valid um</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">insofar as like this is a show of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">imagining what it would be like and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.170" end="00:10:05.450" style="s2">trying to idealize the situation but</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:10.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s fictional</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.450" end="00:10:13.720" style="s2">you know we might still think different</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.040" end="00:10:15.890" style="s2">aspects of it are weird or regressive</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.720" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">but it&#39;s really thought real real</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.890" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">thought experiment to put yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:28.690" style="s2">that world this specific world of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:31.550" style="s2">science fiction yes and it is like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a love-hate relationship I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.550" end="00:10:35.450" style="s2">with Star Trek I think from my childhood</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:37.250" style="s2">I&#39;m like like almost being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.450" end="00:10:39.350" style="s2">watch it and now I&#39;d really love sci-fi</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.250" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">and I love putting myself in that world</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:44.209" style="s2">and at the same time there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.660" end="00:10:46.250" style="s2">work me about the science of it like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.209" end="00:10:49.339" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s all these half species</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.250" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">right like half half Vulcan half human</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.339" end="00:10:55.399" style="s2">like know biology states that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">impossible there&#39;s no and it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.399" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">just through you know like sexual</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">intercourse it&#39;s not like they were like</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:02.060" style="s2">designed in a lab or something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:03.450" style="s2">would make it maybe somewhat possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.450" end="00:11:10.590" style="s2">yet I do like that difference between it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">being the imagination of people in 20 30</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.590" end="00:11:16.590" style="s2">years ago and yet even the people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:18.870" style="s2">are writing it probably were more</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.590" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">advanced than what they wrote but they</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.870" end="00:11:23.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t figure the regular population was</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:25.350" style="s2">so they couldn&#39;t include certain things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.220" end="00:11:28.830" style="s2">or any like I think Star Trek had one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.350" end="00:11:30.540" style="s2">the first interracial kisses and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.830" end="00:11:32.310" style="s2">know like of course that would be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.540" end="00:11:35.000" style="s2">even the fact we still have races in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.310" end="00:11:37.470" style="s2">human population that are quite distinct</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.000" end="00:11:39.630" style="s2">when you know like what is the chances</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.470" end="00:11:42.570" style="s2">of a Caucasian person still existing 400</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.630" end="00:11:45.150" style="s2">years like really we&#39;re pretty much like</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.570" end="00:11:48.540" style="s2">the white page like we we disappear and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.150" end="00:11:53.640" style="s2">there&#39;s um and that happens in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.540" end="00:11:55.560" style="s2">start of spacefaring human like what do</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.640" end="00:11:57.750" style="s2">you do only cast people that are at</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.560" end="00:11:59.640" style="s2">least you know don&#39;t look Caucasian yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.750" end="00:12:02.220" style="s2">actually that&#39;s a great opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.640" end="00:12:05.460" style="s2">do that what about all the other the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.220" end="00:12:07.050" style="s2">other universes and but I love the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.460" end="00:12:08.850" style="s2">exploration and I&#39;m going to different</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.050" end="00:12:10.620" style="s2">different cultures and they do have like</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.850" end="00:12:13.250" style="s2">the Klingons in a very wharf area and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.620" end="00:12:16.770" style="s2">the Vulcans that are very logical and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.250" end="00:12:19.380" style="s2">Betazoids that you know are empathic but</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.770" end="00:12:22.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of like they embrace the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.380" end="00:12:24.780" style="s2">culture of species but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.440" end="00:12:26.580" style="s2">embrace the individualism of those exact</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.780" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">same things right that like a human</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.580" end="00:12:30.120" style="s2">being who&#39;s more violent has something</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:33.380" style="s2">different to bring in a human being</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.120" end="00:12:36.050" style="s2">that&#39;s logical and it&#39;s like our</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.380" end="00:12:38.820" style="s2">combination of selves that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.050" end="00:12:41.580" style="s2">unique and able to give something and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.820" end="00:12:44.580" style="s2">yet it&#39;s still very needing to conform</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.580" end="00:12:46.380" style="s2">to be part of Starfleet and I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.580" end="00:12:49.110" style="s2">think we&#39;re there now 20 years later and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.380" end="00:12:52.500" style="s2">let alone 400 like 300 400 years from</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.110" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">now and hopefully there&#39;s more more</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.500" end="00:12:57.720" style="s2">diversity and the ageism like Wesley for</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">the whole first season is basically sees</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.720" end="00:13:01.020" style="s2">everything before they see it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.220" end="00:13:04.530" style="s2">like okay the first few times I get it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.020" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2">right as a kid they don&#39;t see but come</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.530" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">on by the time they get to like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.810" end="00:13:11.610" style="s2">seventh eighth time this happens they</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:13.170" style="s2">should kind of be saying okay no last</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:16.930" style="s2">time we remember tell us what you think</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.170" end="00:13:22.029" style="s2">let&#39;s let it does get there</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:26.380" style="s2">exactly like like yeah I mean keep in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.029" end="00:13:29.350" style="s2">mind like he&#39;s like a teenager and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.380" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">they give him a position as ensign acne</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.350" end="00:13:34.330" style="s2">acting ensign on the bridge of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:36.600" style="s2">enterprise so like he he you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.330" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">there&#39;s not really ageism it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.600" end="00:13:43.290" style="s2">like rate isn&#39;t well yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:45.940" style="s2">it&#39;s ageism at first as you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.290" end="00:13:47.080" style="s2">like what like like Picard doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.940" end="00:13:48.760" style="s2">children and he&#39;s like get these</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.080" end="00:13:51.130" style="s2">children off the bridge right but then</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.760" end="00:13:53.500" style="s2">the whole point of Wesley in the show is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.130" end="00:13:55.690" style="s2">to overcome that and for him to become</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.500" end="00:13:57.430" style="s2">such a key character at a key</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.690" end="00:14:00.850" style="s2">relationship for the card</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.430" end="00:14:05.100" style="s2">mmm but um you know it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.850" end="00:14:08.920" style="s2">like your point about the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.100" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">reality of science fiction like it may</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.920" end="00:14:13.990" style="s2">very well be that there are limits to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:16.600" style="s2">certain things like like space travel</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.990" end="00:14:18.520" style="s2">and so when we imagine these worlds like</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.600" end="00:14:19.779" style="s2">Star Wars or Star Trek or the Marvel</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.520" end="00:14:22.600" style="s2">Cinematic Universe that have</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.779" end="00:14:25.060" style="s2">interplanetary travel that may very well</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.600" end="00:14:28.029" style="s2">never come to pass that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.060" end="00:14:30.940" style="s2">science fiction a kind of fantasy that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.029" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">we never achieve or cross that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.940" end="00:14:34.529" style="s2">say other science fiction things can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:37.209" style="s2">come true like all sorts of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.529" end="00:14:39.940" style="s2">transhumanism here on earth or going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.209" end="00:14:47.020" style="s2">Mars and stuff like that but the actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.940" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">idea of you know civilizations meeting</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.020" end="00:14:52.630" style="s2">each other we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:54.300" style="s2">embraced this idea of course because</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.630" end="00:14:56.830" style="s2">it&#39;s great for storytelling and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">imagination but but technologically it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.830" end="00:15:01.390" style="s2">might just actually be impossible and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:04.089" style="s2">impossible in the sense that like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.390" end="00:15:06.640" style="s2">never been achieved in the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.089" end="00:15:09.700" style="s2">may never be achieved you know by by any</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.640" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">species anywhere yeah and it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.700" end="00:15:15.100" style="s2">all like as a biologist it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.810" style="s2">bugged me the interbreeding day like</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.100" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not a possibility but even beyond</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.810" end="00:15:20.680" style="s2">that the fact that almost everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:23.860" style="s2">humanoid the fact that almost everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.680" end="00:15:26.380" style="s2">has two genders two sexes the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.860" end="00:15:27.790" style="s2">those two sexes are very gendered</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.380" end="00:15:30.310" style="s2">exactly how ours are</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.790" end="00:15:31.990" style="s2">right despite the fact that we can see</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.310" end="00:15:35.200" style="s2">in the animal kingdom that&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.990" end="00:15:37.180" style="s2">the same right like it&#39;s more so in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.200" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">in like mammalian species then</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.180" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">unnecessarily the bird and reptile</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:42.640" style="s2">species and fishes it&#39;s like come on</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:44.530" style="s2">just looking at and that being said</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.640" end="00:15:46.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve come to those realizations in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:47.830" style="s2">biology kind of in the last few decades</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.270" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not like we knew that I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.830" end="00:15:51.880" style="s2">kind of probably do it 20 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.390" end="00:15:54.700" style="s2">but not like just at the infancy of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.880" end="00:15:56.920" style="s2">and so like I&#39;m again only really</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.700" end="00:15:58.510" style="s2">rewatched the first season so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.920" end="00:16:01.900" style="s2">know maybe when they do encounter a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.510" end="00:16:04.360" style="s2">species with like three genders or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.900" end="00:16:06.340" style="s2">I think it gets a lot more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.360" end="00:16:09.310" style="s2">after the first season like ivory</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.340" end="00:16:11.290" style="s2">watched it recently as well III don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.310" end="00:16:13.110" style="s2">remember how far I got into it I might</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.290" end="00:16:16.810" style="s2">have got enough to like season five I</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.110" end="00:16:19.990" style="s2">was just just binge watching it last</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.810" end="00:16:21.790" style="s2">year as I watched it my childhood as</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.990" end="00:16:24.310" style="s2">well but I wanted to watch it again and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.790" end="00:16:27.190" style="s2">I think the first season you can see in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.310" end="00:16:30.040" style="s2">the aesthetics some similarities with</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.190" end="00:16:33.820" style="s2">the show from the 60s which was like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.040" end="00:16:36.070" style="s2">long time ago but there&#39;s still in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.820" end="00:16:38.380" style="s2">very first season still some of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.070" end="00:16:39.940" style="s2">of aesthetic crossover and like bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.380" end="00:16:41.530" style="s2">special effects and stuff you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.940" end="00:16:44.080" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but then the show like</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.530" end="00:16:46.360" style="s2">really gets good like in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.080" end="00:16:50.230" style="s2">writing and all the characters and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.360" end="00:16:54.510" style="s2">they encounter out there I just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.230" end="00:16:54.510" style="s2">Whoopi Goldberg just got introduced okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.350" end="00:17:01.240" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m just gonna say but like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.290" end="00:17:03.460" style="s2">first officer what I come upon his name</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.240" end="00:17:06.670" style="s2">is Will Riker Riker</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.460" end="00:17:08.410" style="s2">he is such a womanizer like he won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.670" end="00:17:12.190" style="s2">she&#39;s for like the first time is all</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.410" end="00:17:13.990" style="s2">like hey just like likes no personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.190" end="00:17:15.040" style="s2">space just like right up next to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.990" end="00:17:18.100" style="s2">above like again</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.040" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">20 years later past that I can only view</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.100" end="00:17:21.100" style="s2">in 400 years</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:23.980" style="s2">not to me that that&#39;s not still a trade</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.100" end="00:17:25.810" style="s2">right of course probably but like in for</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.980" end="00:17:27.970" style="s2">your professionalism and like all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.810" end="00:17:29.830" style="s2">women are very like beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.970" end="00:17:32.680" style="s2">feminine in that being like and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.830" end="00:17:34.180" style="s2">there&#39;s the one officer who&#39;s who&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.680" end="00:17:37.090" style="s2">course straight because there&#39;s no gay</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.180" end="00:17:39.670" style="s2">yet even though they let you don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.090" end="00:17:41.260" style="s2">in the 60s one one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.670" end="00:17:43.090" style="s2">characters is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.260" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">chillie gay in real life right and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.090" end="00:17:49.030" style="s2">know that he&#39;s out in the cast but not</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">in the show because again the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.030" end="00:17:52.570" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily handle that but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:17:54.100" style="s2">remember she gets killed off in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.570" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">first season she&#39;s got like short hair</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.100" end="00:17:59.260" style="s2">and she&#39;s a little more masculine</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:18:03.040" style="s2">she&#39;s also yeah I guess you know she</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.260" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">hooks up with data yeah yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.040" end="00:18:08.680" style="s2">also interesting right I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:10.600" style="s2">specifically but I&#39;m pretty sure they</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.680" end="00:18:12.910" style="s2">probably have some gay characters</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.600" end="00:18:15.190" style="s2">explicitly at some point in the show I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.910" end="00:18:17.470" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember specifically but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.190" end="00:18:19.900" style="s2">just like there&#39;s there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.470" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">progressivism packed in there whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.900" end="00:18:29.970" style="s2">it&#39;s hidden or explicit so I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:33.040" style="s2">can&#39;t think of an example but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.970" end="00:18:35.020" style="s2">mean even like this is not fantasy at</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.040" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">all but Grey&#39;s Anatomy right it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.020" end="00:18:40.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like 15th season and if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:41.890" style="s2">from the first part where one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.360" end="00:18:43.720" style="s2">doctors like one of the people plays a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.890" end="00:18:45.420" style="s2">doctor got fired for being homophobic in</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.720" end="00:18:48.430" style="s2">one of the first few seasons and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.420" end="00:18:50.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like gay trans you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.430" end="00:18:54.070" style="s2">like like it&#39;s not even like token</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.200" end="00:18:55.510" style="s2">characters like actually a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.070" end="00:18:58.780" style="s2">of characters right and they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.510" end="00:19:00.490" style="s2">have and that&#39;s in its own show format</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.780" end="00:19:01.750" style="s2">and I can only imagine seven years in</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.490" end="00:19:03.970" style="s2">Star Trek it&#39;s gonna be the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.750" end="00:19:07.270" style="s2">where it&#39;s like how you&#39;ve kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.970" end="00:19:11.020" style="s2">progressed in our actual time period</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.270" end="00:19:14.050" style="s2">during that and watching that in the in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.020" end="00:19:15.700" style="s2">media and I think that that is like life</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.050" end="00:19:19.210" style="s2">imitating art and art imitating life</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.700" end="00:19:20.920" style="s2">right if we don&#39;t have heroes and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.210" end="00:19:22.510" style="s2">are that look different who have</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.920" end="00:19:25.180" style="s2">different abilities and we can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.510" end="00:19:26.560" style="s2">it and therefore we can&#39;t create it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.180" end="00:19:28.330" style="s2">then we also think that like well</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.560" end="00:19:30.010" style="s2">because we can&#39;t imagine it the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.330" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t ready for it so we can&#39;t put it</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.010" end="00:19:35.470" style="s2">out there like when Hunger Games first</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">came out that wasn&#39;t that long ago and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.470" end="00:19:39.160" style="s2">they were like oh this is never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:41.710" style="s2">take off it&#39;s a female lead and it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.160" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">huge it&#39;s like no I think we can handle</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.710" end="00:19:45.160" style="s2">it like you do know 50% of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:48.310" style="s2">population is female right like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.160" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">not so you can have a strong female</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.310" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">character people</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:58.810" style="s2">use like like like the Terminator the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:20:01.690" style="s2">series was based on a strong female lead</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.810" end="00:20:03.700" style="s2">you know like people really easily</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.690" end="00:20:08.620" style="s2">forget these things in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.700" end="00:20:10.360" style="s2">history of TV and film yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.620" end="00:20:12.790" style="s2">absolutely like you look at I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.360" end="00:20:13.030" style="s2">a significant story that&#39;s not right at</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.790" end="00:20:14.920" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.030" end="00:20:17.080" style="s2">Wizard of Oz and how the Wizard of Oz</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.920" end="00:20:18.190" style="s2">has like a female lead is the main</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.080" end="00:20:20.410" style="s2">character yes she has three male</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.190" end="00:20:24.100" style="s2">companions but like it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.410" end="00:20:26.830" style="s2">different story than what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.100" end="00:20:30.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t he at the time right like it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.830" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">like she was on her own journey and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.310" end="00:20:33.340" style="s2">witches you know play a big role both</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:35.020" style="s2">like they&#39;re really good I&#39;m really bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.340" end="00:20:37.900" style="s2">very archetypal but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.020" end="00:20:39.400" style="s2">yeah we can it&#39;s not and I&#39;m sure the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.900" end="00:20:41.500" style="s2">pendulum will swing back and forth every</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.400" end="00:20:43.570" style="s2">everybody it&#39;s it&#39;s a cultural thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.500" end="00:20:46.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like like Star Wars too like</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.570" end="00:20:49.660" style="s2">Princess Leia is a badass female lead</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.150" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">like like very feminist for the time you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.660" end="00:20:53.980" style="s2">know like like extremely strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:56.200" style="s2">character and not drawing attention to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.980" end="00:21:01.210" style="s2">that fact either it&#39;s just a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">fact and so yeah people today who say</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.210" end="00:21:06.910" style="s2">stuff like that like like this or that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:10.510" style="s2">won&#39;t sell or whatever like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.910" end="00:21:12.370" style="s2">dumb it&#39;s just dumb clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.510" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">literally anything that&#39;s out of the box</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.370" end="00:21:17.920" style="s2">as long as it&#39;s also good right like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:19.960" style="s2">can&#39;t really have tokenism where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.920" end="00:21:21.550" style="s2">just like let&#39;s have a female lead just</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.960" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">to have a female lead or let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.550" end="00:21:26.170" style="s2">black movie just to have a black movie</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:27.970" style="s2">like oh my god what was the movie that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.170" end="00:21:30.100" style="s2">was the superheroes where they were like</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.970" end="00:21:32.650" style="s2">one of the African fictional countries</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.100" end="00:21:35.380" style="s2">where they had that it&#39;s like árbol</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.650" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">Sirius Black Panther I find her thank</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.380" end="00:21:38.950" style="s2">you and it&#39;s a good movie like alone</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:42.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a good story</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.950" end="00:21:45.400" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s needed you know I think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.460" end="00:21:48.940" style="s2">need more we&#39;re starting to definitely</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.400" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">more abilities and more like feminine</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:54.010" style="s2">men and masculine women being in those</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:56.050" style="s2">roles and still be in you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.010" end="00:21:57.880" style="s2">mean like both heroic having good</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.050" end="00:22:02.290" style="s2">qualities and having more characters</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.880" end="00:22:04.120" style="s2">that are what is the word have a balance</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.290" end="00:22:05.710" style="s2">right where you&#39;re not all good or all</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.120" end="00:22:07.179" style="s2">bad and that definitely I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.710" end="00:22:08.590" style="s2">can have all good and all characters</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.179" end="00:22:10.929" style="s2">anymore in media</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.590" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t sell we don&#39;t resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.929" end="00:22:16.179" style="s2">them whereas characters like Nurse</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:19.330" style="s2">Jackie and Dexter and ones that are like</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.179" end="00:22:21.010" style="s2">okay you&#39;ve got light and dark you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.330" end="00:22:24.309" style="s2">got you know both and those are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.010" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">actually what we are is resonating we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.309" end="00:22:29.080" style="s2">have all of that in us and so when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.909" style="s2">see it on the screen it&#39;s more it brings</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.080" end="00:22:32.710" style="s2">it you know we notice anymore with those</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.909" end="00:22:34.990" style="s2">characters we like them more but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.710" end="00:22:36.549" style="s2">know like a Dexter and a Nurse Jackie 30</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.990" end="00:22:39.669" style="s2">years ago wouldn&#39;t a flow and like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.549" end="00:22:41.649" style="s2">would not have been in any way and those</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.669" end="00:22:45.190" style="s2">are even those ones are over a decade</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.649" end="00:22:48.940" style="s2">old right like yeah so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.190" end="00:22:51.880" style="s2">that that Picard is is back you know in</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.940" end="00:22:58.270" style="s2">this show I haven&#39;t seen yet but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.880" end="00:22:59.710" style="s2">read reviews and I you know it all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.270" end="00:23:04.120" style="s2">behind the scenes stuff is really</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.710" end="00:23:07.029" style="s2">interesting because you know initially</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.120" end="00:23:08.289" style="s2">Patrick Stewart said no and then he kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.029" end="00:23:10.029" style="s2">of listened to their pitch and went</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.289" end="00:23:12.549" style="s2">along with it and when he what he liked</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.029" end="00:23:15.880" style="s2">about it is that you know part of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.549" end="00:23:17.559" style="s2">purpose is actually to engage again</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.880" end="00:23:19.630" style="s2">specifically with the political moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.559" end="00:23:21.669" style="s2">right right so that&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.630" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">have the T in the next generation tone</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.669" end="00:23:28.380" style="s2">it has this kind of you know reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:31.390" style="s2">like like trumpism and brexit like like</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.380" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">those themes and so Patrick Stewart has</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.390" end="00:23:34.779" style="s2">talked about this explicitly he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.130" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what drew me to it and this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.779" end="00:23:38.620" style="s2">is what I think the world needs and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s you know so action</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.620" end="00:23:44.700" style="s2">focused and like a lot of the the bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:48.309" style="s2">characters in it are you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.700" end="00:23:49.840" style="s2">separatists or segregationists or</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.309" end="00:23:54.010" style="s2">whatever right there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.840" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">progressive ideology that completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.010" end="00:24:01.059" style="s2">goes against a Picard&#39;s whole diplomacy</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:03.220" style="s2">thing whole embodiment of Starfleet but</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.059" end="00:24:05.260" style="s2">that&#39;s also this is also a kind of flaw</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.220" end="00:24:11.190" style="s2">in the show and kind of its generating</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.260" end="00:24:15.220" style="s2">backlash but where am I going with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.190" end="00:24:16.330" style="s2">do you know like because I&#39;m in that one</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.220" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">I watched the pilot which is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.330" end="00:24:20.740" style="s2">overground so far they talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:21.620" style="s2">Romulans having something happened with</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.740" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">the Romulans</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.620" end="00:24:26.270" style="s2">they&#39;re there to start with their son</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:28.580" style="s2">went supernova as well as some androids</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.270" end="00:24:31.820" style="s2">whatever they call them in there went</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.580" end="00:24:34.130" style="s2">rogue and went bad is another they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.820" end="00:24:36.470" style="s2">illegal is that from one of the movies</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.130" end="00:24:39.830" style="s2">or one of the shows yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.470" end="00:24:43.820" style="s2">reference to I think Star Trek in 2009</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.830" end="00:24:46.670" style="s2">the the 2009 film by JJ Abrams where</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.820" end="00:24:49.280" style="s2">they you know something happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.670" end="00:24:51.830" style="s2">and the star goes supernova and it kills</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.280" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">the planet and so Picard was apparently</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.830" end="00:24:55.130" style="s2">involved in some kind of evacuation that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:57.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the connection and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.130" end="00:24:58.520" style="s2">premises so so this is the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.020" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">behind-the-scenes connection to because</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.520" end="00:25:04.520" style="s2">the the writers and the showrunners for</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:08.500" style="s2">this Picard series are the same people</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.520" end="00:25:09.800" style="s2">that made those JJ Abrams films like</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.500" end="00:25:12.110" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.800" end="00:25:14.660" style="s2">are the more a more recent Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.110" end="00:25:18.140" style="s2">movies about kind of the coming-of-age</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.660" end="00:25:22.340" style="s2">of the the first what like the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.140" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">who star in the very first one yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.340" end="00:25:27.890" style="s2">it&#39;s about the original characters but</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.170" style="s2">but and it is a parallel kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:32.330" style="s2">timeline but this Picard series attempts</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.170" end="00:25:33.290" style="s2">to like weave it back in so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.330" end="00:25:37.550" style="s2">sort of Kant</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.290" end="00:25:40.940" style="s2">Canon but so it&#39;s not JJ Abrams AJ</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.550" end="00:25:42.590" style="s2">Abrams involved but Alex Kurtzman is one</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.940" end="00:25:44.510" style="s2">of these writers involved in and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.590" end="00:25:51.170" style="s2">showrunners and if you look at his</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.510" end="00:25:54.470" style="s2">filmography it it&#39;s a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.170" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">blockbuster type stuff that has not done</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.470" end="00:26:00.940" style="s2">well critically it&#39;s done well</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:06.920" style="s2">financially but not critically right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.940" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s just super interesting like like</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.920" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">what&#39;s going on kind of behind the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:12.920" style="s2">scenes with with the writing and you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:14.809" style="s2">you know because we know these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.920" end="00:26:17.690" style="s2">fictional universes in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.809" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually trying to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.690" end="00:26:23.630" style="s2">it on a meta level to you know read</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:25.130" style="s2">between the lines and get get inside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.630" end="00:26:27.429" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.130" end="00:26:27.429" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.400" end="00:26:33.810" style="s2">so yeah I don&#39;t know what else to say on</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.750" end="00:26:37.240" style="s2">that point but it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.810" end="00:26:42.100" style="s2">yeah no I mean I think that sci-fi and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.240" end="00:26:43.930" style="s2">fiction in general is how like we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.100" end="00:26:45.910" style="s2">imagine a world if we can&#39;t imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.930" end="00:26:47.470" style="s2">world we can&#39;t live into it for sure but</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.910" end="00:26:50.410" style="s2">and I guess my point is they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.470" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">imagined right like they don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.410" end="00:26:52.840" style="s2">what it looks like they they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:55.030" style="s2">even imagined a resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.840" end="00:26:57.040" style="s2">fully right like they haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.030" end="00:26:58.630" style="s2">imagined what it actually means to not</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.040" end="00:27:00.760" style="s2">have currency and yet they have right</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.630" end="00:27:02.770" style="s2">like it&#39;s in between that it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.760" end="00:27:04.420" style="s2">like having how they enact the prime</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.770" end="00:27:06.130" style="s2">directive and then for any plot point</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.420" end="00:27:07.510" style="s2">they get rid of it it&#39;s like someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.130" end="00:27:09.490" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually sitting there being like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.510" end="00:27:10.840" style="s2">wait no that&#39;s not much like they have</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.490" end="00:27:13.090" style="s2">gambling right and it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.840" end="00:27:14.470" style="s2">putting in actual chips that equal a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.090" end="00:27:16.060" style="s2">currency and you&#39;re like wait but</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.470" end="00:27:17.830" style="s2">there&#39;s no currency so what are you</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.060" end="00:27:19.750" style="s2">buying with that or what are you well</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:22.110" style="s2">when they where the new is when they</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.750" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">play poker which is it which is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.110" end="00:27:27.190" style="s2">recurrent theme on the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:29.350" style="s2">it&#39;s actually just for fun they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.190" end="00:27:32.230" style="s2">you know there&#39;s no there&#39;s no stakes</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.350" end="00:27:34.830" style="s2">but they act as if there&#39;s stakes so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.230" end="00:27:37.690" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of funny - um</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.830" end="00:27:39.730" style="s2">but but this is this is the point again</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.690" end="00:27:42.460" style="s2">like it&#39;s like for the most part the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.730" end="00:27:46.180" style="s2">next generation has kind of processed</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.460" end="00:27:48.250" style="s2">that kind of scarcity mindset and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.180" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">built it into the world whereas in all</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.250" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">the others it&#39;s like there&#39;s some sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">of conflict based on something mmm and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">and in the in the JJ Abrams versions</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:03.160" style="s2">especially like the the reasons for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">conflict is a lot more kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.160" end="00:28:09.430" style="s2">diluted and Oh oversimplified right like</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:11.680" style="s2">oh this person&#39;s angry about something</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.430" end="00:28:14.770" style="s2">and they wait you know they want to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.680" end="00:28:17.350" style="s2">revenge on Starfleet and the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.770" end="00:28:20.020" style="s2">like in a resource-based economy post</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.350" end="00:28:23.170" style="s2">scarcity environment like history and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.020" end="00:28:25.240" style="s2">life would actually be relatively boring</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.170" end="00:28:27.850" style="s2">in that sense like like there wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.240" end="00:28:30.520" style="s2">be conflict and that&#39;s kind of the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.850" end="00:28:32.620" style="s2">is I can envision the conflict there</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.520" end="00:28:34.210" style="s2">would be yeah and so we can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.620" end="00:28:36.430" style="s2">stories about it because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.210" end="00:28:38.290" style="s2">interesting to us yeah now when</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.430" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">everything is based on emotion and based</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.290" end="00:28:41.630" style="s2">on scarcity when it&#39;s not based on like</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:42.950" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.630" end="00:28:44.390" style="s2">tense emotions or someone gets super</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.950" end="00:28:46.520" style="s2">jealous and kills someone and someone</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.370" end="00:30:59.300" style="s2">in the future RIT&#39;s like all the species</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:03.350" style="s2">are monogamous all the species are</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.300" end="00:31:07.340" style="s2">gendered and very feminine masculine I</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.340" end="00:31:12.530" style="s2">been able to envision that world in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.540" end="00:31:14.450" style="s2">90s even though it existed so like I</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.530" end="00:31:16.340" style="s2">mean I even knew about war in people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.450" end="00:31:20.360" style="s2">that they had multiple wives but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.340" end="00:31:21.680" style="s2">different that&#39;s a different energy</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.360" end="00:31:23.570" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how it&#39;s handled</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.680" end="00:31:25.280" style="s2">because you know for the most part it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.570" end="00:31:27.800" style="s2">seems as though a lot of the crew is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.280" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">just asexual like they don&#39;t have sex</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.800" end="00:31:31.910" style="s2">lives they&#39;re just they&#39;ve so fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:33.740" style="s2">from the work that they do and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.910" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">friendships that they have that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.740" end="00:31:39.380" style="s2">know they don&#39;t need to and Picard</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">especially Picard is like you know put</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.380" end="00:31:44.420" style="s2">like the few times women you know come</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">on to him he pushes him away with a cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.420" end="00:31:50.420" style="s2">with a couple exceptions right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:52.100" style="s2">um no I think it&#39;s interesting how they</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.420" end="00:31:56.170" style="s2">manage that because another show that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.100" end="00:32:01.880" style="s2">love that avoided the kind of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.170" end="00:32:02.950" style="s2">to to you know bring sex into it is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.880" end="00:32:07.130" style="s2">x-files</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.950" end="00:32:11.770" style="s2">you know such a such a long long running</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.179" end="00:32:20.420" style="s2">Mulder and Scully apart like sexually</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.660" end="00:32:24.140" style="s2">they kept them very close personally</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.420" end="00:32:26.450" style="s2">like like partners but kept them apart</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.140" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">in terms of a relationship and it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.450" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">just you know it&#39;s so beautiful like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:39.020" style="s2">speaks to a kind of integrity that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:40.580" style="s2">don&#39;t really have or it&#39;s not that we</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.580" end="00:32:49.059" style="s2">very often you know where where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">relationship is the relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.059" end="00:32:56.840" style="s2">without any sexual aspects the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:59.650" style="s2">relationship itself is is what is for</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.910" end="00:36:59.790" style="s2">the same time or which is I think what</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.650" end="00:37:02.250" style="s2">other people get out of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.790" end="00:37:03.990" style="s2">and I can&#39;t because if you trigger me</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.310" end="00:37:13.710" style="s2">long and I&#39;m never gonna give up an</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">ounce of love for her I don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.710" end="00:37:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know what that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.310" style="s2">it&#39;s been there my whole life like my</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.750" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">sister and me have had this conflict for</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.310" end="00:37:23.370" style="s2">a year and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know if I</p>

<p begin="00:37:23.370" end="00:37:26.820" style="s2">getting there I can feel it but if it</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.840" end="00:37:28.890" style="s2">takes a year with my sister I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.820" end="00:37:31.470" style="s2">what&#39;s the chance of a relationship ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.890" end="00:37:32.910" style="s2">working yeah like that&#39;s a long time so</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.470" end="00:37:33.360" style="s2">like my nervous system that calms out</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.910" end="00:37:37.740" style="s2">and not</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.360" end="00:37:39.060" style="s2">react in that way and let&#39;s hope I never</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.740" end="00:37:41.990" style="s2">get there with my child because that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.060" end="00:37:45.570" style="s2">would be even more devastating but</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.990" end="00:37:47.820" style="s2">relationships are like that&#39;s where our</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.570" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">drama is gonna be that&#39;s gonna always be</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.820" end="00:37:53.840" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re just going to play it out in</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:56.490" style="s2">different ways than traditional monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.840" end="00:37:59.610" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s such an important lesson</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.490" end="00:38:02.520" style="s2">of the show that even once we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.610" end="00:38:04.650" style="s2">post-scarcity that you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.520" end="00:38:11.640" style="s2">types of problems will still still play</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.650" end="00:38:14.220" style="s2">out you know like yeah that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.640" end="00:38:16.680" style="s2">lesson for right now is because we we</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.220" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">don&#39;t quite have post-scarcity right but</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.680" end="00:38:21.510" style="s2">we have some types of scarcity and if</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:24.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not equally distributed around the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.510" end="00:38:26.430" style="s2">world like the fact that you have you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.750" end="00:38:30.210" style="s2">know we can go to our taps and have</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.430" end="00:38:32.670" style="s2">clean running water water means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.210" end="00:38:37.320" style="s2">no scarcity of that of that resource for</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.670" end="00:38:39.690" style="s2">you but it is scarce for other people so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.320" end="00:38:42.330" style="s2">that changes all of your behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.690" end="00:38:45.180" style="s2">dynamics and opportunities in it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.330" end="00:38:47.160" style="s2">like absolutely I mean with water in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.180" end="00:38:48.870" style="s2">general even when you look at it like</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.160" end="00:38:51.750" style="s2">Vancouver doesn&#39;t we don&#39;t charge for</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.870" end="00:38:54.840" style="s2">water it&#39;s part of our taxes but</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.750" end="00:38:57.390" style="s2">Richmond charges for water and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.840" end="00:38:58.860" style="s2">difference in even though it still is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.390" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">plentiful right it falls from the sky</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.860" end="00:39:02.970" style="s2">constantly all year round but it has to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:05.190" style="s2">be pumped to you and it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.970" end="00:39:07.710" style="s2">cleaned and had there&#39;s a cost to it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.190" end="00:39:09.330" style="s2">the actual cost being associated like</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.710" end="00:39:11.190" style="s2">they don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know about if</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.330" end="00:39:13.470" style="s2">they have water restrictions in the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.190" end="00:39:15.540" style="s2">way we do during the droughts during the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.470" end="00:39:17.460" style="s2">summer because it&#39;s like well if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.540" end="00:39:18.870" style="s2">paid for it you probably wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.460" end="00:39:19.890" style="s2">watering your lawn especially if the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.870" end="00:39:22.590" style="s2">price is really high then in like</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.500" end="00:39:30.900" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;re getting to</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.240" end="00:39:38.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t solid needed and isn&#39;t any at the</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.230" end="00:39:45.330" style="s2">experience that but not with water like</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.980" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah a different mentality</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.330" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">when you have to pay for something</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.980" end="00:39:52.020" style="s2">and when ants even if it&#39;s readily</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:54.630" style="s2">available and when you don&#39;t have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.020" end="00:39:56.490" style="s2">for it and yet that means I probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.630" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">waste more than I what if I paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.490" end="00:40:00.840" style="s2">right like there&#39;s a real even though I</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.520" style="s2">care deeply about the planet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.840" end="00:40:04.340" style="s2">still times where like my daughter wants</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.520" end="00:40:07.080" style="s2">to play in water same with how she</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.340" end="00:40:08.369" style="s2">crates art and it&#39;s the most uninvited</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.080" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">friendly it&#39;s like a lot of tape and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.369" end="00:40:12.840" style="s2">paper she could not reduce scrap paper</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:17.790" style="s2">like brand-new piece of white paper cut</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.840" end="00:40:19.560" style="s2">something on like boy but um I&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.790" end="00:40:20.820" style="s2">it because it&#39;s her artist like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.560" end="00:40:24.510" style="s2">really get her into the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.820" end="00:40:26.010" style="s2">mode without demanding right and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.510" end="00:40:27.600" style="s2">she&#39;s not gonna get there because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.010" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2">not gonna like I do I&#39;m like well this</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.600" end="00:40:31.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t the greatest for the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:32.490" style="s2">that same with when she wants to play</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.020" end="00:40:34.260" style="s2">water it&#39;s like let&#39;s not run the water</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.490" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">let&#39;s fill the sink up but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.260" end="00:40:40.410" style="s2">time it&#39;s like yeah playing it it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:42.750" style="s2">to kind of deal with scarcity with your</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.410" end="00:40:44.869" style="s2">kid in the same way I will with adults</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.750" end="00:40:51.300" style="s2">like maybe that&#39;s not the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.869" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">use our water anyway yeah and that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.300" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">at all continually comes up every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:57.630" style="s2">every week when I put out the recycling</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:40:59.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of recycling I need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.630" end="00:41:00.869" style="s2">out the entire supply chain I believe</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.790" end="00:41:02.850" style="s2">you are too</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.869" end="00:41:05.970" style="s2">and yeah I just I just want to see it</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.850" end="00:41:07.590" style="s2">streamlined you know like yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.970" end="00:41:11.010" style="s2">weird and that&#39;s the nice thing about</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.590" end="00:41:12.890" style="s2">like the idea of like a Enterprise kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.010" end="00:41:15.060" style="s2">of ship is that it&#39;s all self-contained</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.890" end="00:41:17.910" style="s2">you know and you don&#39;t have like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.060" end="00:41:20.460" style="s2">different sets of clothes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.910" end="00:41:22.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like everything&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.460" end="00:41:25.230" style="s2">structured like in a military way but</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.200" end="00:41:27.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not military in any conventional</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.230" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">sense like like they have hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.090" end="00:41:37.170" style="s2">still but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:39.870" style="s2">just not based on the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.170" end="00:41:43.110" style="s2">militarism right it&#39;s based on like</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.870" end="00:41:45.930" style="s2">really abstract ideals about peace and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.110" end="00:41:49.070" style="s2">diplomacy you know that method that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.930" end="00:41:52.190" style="s2">protocol having faith in that process</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.070" end="00:41:53.370" style="s2">like that&#39;s what we have to aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:55.230" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.370" end="00:41:58.020" style="s2">I guess that was part of like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.230" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">hierarchy of it that like triggers being</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.020" end="00:42:02.580" style="s2">I wanna see like when I look at in our</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:04.440" style="s2">worlds people getting into medical</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.580" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">school and I went to school with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.440" end="00:42:08.070" style="s2">of people who get into medical school</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2">and once you&#39;re in medical school you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.070" end="00:42:11.430" style="s2">basically pushed through like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:13.110" style="s2">there unless you do something absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.430" end="00:42:14.340" style="s2">horrific you&#39;re gonna get through you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.110" end="00:42:16.290" style="s2">gonna be a doctor it depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.340" end="00:42:18.360" style="s2">kind of doctor you&#39;re gonna be and at</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.290" end="00:42:22.470" style="s2">the same time to get into Medical School</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.360" end="00:42:24.840" style="s2">is such a rigorous process that only a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.470" end="00:42:26.730" style="s2">tiny fraction of people can do it and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.840" end="00:42:28.230" style="s2">know that there are people who would</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.730" end="00:42:30.390" style="s2">never get into medical school to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.230" end="00:42:31.590" style="s2">much better doctors and many people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.390" end="00:42:34.170" style="s2">get into medical school who make</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.590" end="00:42:35.670" style="s2">horrible doctors and it&#39;s the same like</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.170" end="00:42:38.070" style="s2">when you have a central body that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.670" end="00:42:39.300" style="s2">decides who&#39;s involved and who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.070" end="00:42:40.680" style="s2">involved I don&#39;t know what we would do</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.300" end="00:42:42.930" style="s2">for medical because I don&#39;t want doctors</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.680" end="00:42:47.100" style="s2">just deciding they&#39;re doctors either but</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.930" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">having a more equitable you know way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.100" end="00:42:50.490" style="s2">get people through out of like here are</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:51.690" style="s2">the skills you need maybe like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.490" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">that you need to be able to be a surgeon</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.690" end="00:42:55.620" style="s2">when you&#39;re never gonna be a surgeon</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.980" end="00:42:57.990" style="s2">right like autistic minds or maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.620" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">of the best doctors but the worst people</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.990" end="00:43:04.620" style="s2">skills in that same in that same aspect</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:05.820" style="s2">I&#39;m saying like that uh yet that&#39;s who I</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.620" end="00:43:07.500" style="s2">want to be my surgeon I&#39;m pretty sure my</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.820" end="00:43:09.690" style="s2">brain surgeon was autistic actually it</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.500" end="00:43:11.130" style="s2">was very not a people person and seen it</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.690" end="00:43:14.100" style="s2">now from this this side of life thank</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.130" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">God like he&#39;s but that&#39;s who I want like</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.100" end="00:43:17.370" style="s2">as an autistic person I want my doctor</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.660" end="00:43:18.930" style="s2">to be autistic I actually want you to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.370" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">not have like oh that you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.930" end="00:43:21.600" style="s2">people skills and only what you know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:23.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know and that&#39;s not a sane</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.600" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">autistic trait like I want that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.640" end="00:43:27.090" style="s2">lack of arrogance and I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:28.770" style="s2">Starfleet it&#39;s kind of a psyche there</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.090" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">could be people who are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.770" end="00:43:33.210" style="s2">brilliant and wouldn&#39;t be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:34.680" style="s2">it in Starfleet like when Wesley goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.210" end="00:43:37.530" style="s2">through it in the first season and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.680" end="00:43:39.510" style="s2">only take one out of the four why why</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.530" end="00:43:41.130" style="s2">are you taking one out of four instead</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.510" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">of like anyone who meets a certain you</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.130" end="00:43:43.650" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean you need the physical</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:46.110" style="s2">traits or you need you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.650" end="00:43:47.880" style="s2">these five qualities and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.110" end="00:43:48.450" style="s2">so funny that you&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.880" end="00:43:51.570" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.450" end="00:43:54.420" style="s2">because for whatever reason on Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:58.890" style="s2">I decided to watch police academy cuz</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.420" end="00:44:00.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s on Netflix and actually I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.890" end="00:44:01.770" style="s2">didn&#39;t remember how good it was I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.420" end="00:44:04.740" style="s2">thought it was just like a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.770" end="00:44:06.810" style="s2">spoof what which it kind of is but but</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.740" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">it also is like pretty well written and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.810" end="00:44:11.880" style="s2">pretty well shot like it&#39;s got pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:14.240" style="s2">interesting block like shots and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.880" end="00:44:20.579" style="s2">blocking and that and the humor is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.240" end="00:44:22.290" style="s2">ridiculously like really funny and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.579" end="00:44:23.670" style="s2">just like slapstick like there is some</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.290" end="00:44:26.670" style="s2">slapstick but then there&#39;s like some</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.670" end="00:44:30.570" style="s2">setups that are just ridiculous so</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.670" end="00:44:33.660" style="s2">ridiculous um so but the premise of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.570" end="00:44:35.400" style="s2">of that movie is that the the mayor of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.660" end="00:44:37.829" style="s2">whatever town decides to open up the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.400" end="00:44:40.410" style="s2">police academy for everybody so nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.829" end="00:44:42.119" style="s2">turned away anyone can come and then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.410" end="00:44:43.589" style="s2">whole premise is that all these rejects</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.119" end="00:44:46.890" style="s2">come like different people with</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.589" end="00:44:51.420" style="s2">different shortcomings and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.890" end="00:44:53.010" style="s2">weaknesses and and you know because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.420" end="00:44:55.319" style="s2">have inner strength they overcome those</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.010" end="00:44:56.849" style="s2">things right they they you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.319" end="00:44:59.130" style="s2">climax of the film they all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.849" end="00:45:00.869" style="s2">succeed in whatever they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.130" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">overcoming their problem was and this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.869" end="00:45:05.940" style="s2">really beautiful in that sense like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:09.000" style="s2">a message of including everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.940" end="00:45:12.890" style="s2">police academy and I&#39;m challenging the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.000" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">authority uh and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.890" end="00:45:19.230" style="s2">no I think those are important like game</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:21.030" style="s2">be things like you need to like I said I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.230" end="00:45:22.319" style="s2">don&#39;t want anyone to be a doctor and you</p>

<p begin="00:46:02.280" end="00:46:05.820" style="s2">a bit like we need to figure and figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.020" end="00:46:07.260" style="s2">out like I don&#39;t think anyone needs to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.820" end="00:46:09.210" style="s2">be a police officer we can figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.260" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">world without police officers but their</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.210" end="00:46:13.140" style="s2">role right we need peacekeepers we need</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.140" end="00:46:18.060" style="s2">we we can think differently on and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.020" end="00:46:19.830" style="s2">create great forces like the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.060" end="00:46:21.390" style="s2">police are called on every crime and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.830" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">they have to deal with any mental health</p>

<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:39.990" style="s2">than others are dealing with those</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:41.250" style="s2">things but that&#39;s not what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.990" end="00:46:43.140" style="s2">called on right it&#39;s like who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.250" end="00:46:45.660" style="s2">closest officer not hey who has the</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.310" end="00:46:57.240" style="s2">people and creating a world where like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:46:59.250" style="s2">it&#39;s both it&#39;s like you can figure out</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.250" end="00:47:02.190" style="s2">can figure out how to increase your</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.390" end="00:47:05.010" style="s2">people skills but you also don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.190" end="00:47:07.140" style="s2">like it&#39;s not and that&#39;s where this idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.010" end="00:47:10.080" style="s2">of like leadership which Picard is very</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.140" end="00:47:11.850" style="s2">like masculine you know and yet still</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.080" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">loses his all the time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.850" end="00:47:15.330" style="s2">like really I feel like how do you get</p>

<p begin="00:47:29.010" end="00:47:32.790" style="s2">I had 300 years I kind of I kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.470" end="00:47:35.880" style="s2">it differently though that like when</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.790" end="00:47:39.600" style="s2">when things get heated on the ship like</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.880" end="00:47:42.600" style="s2">Picard is the one that&#39;s like tries to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.600" end="00:47:45.360" style="s2">avoid avoid disaster at all costs he</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.600" end="00:47:48.270" style="s2">brings everybody you know back down to</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.510" end="00:48:04.320" style="s2">resolve the tension of the show that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:06.870" style="s2">that&#39;s built up by circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.320" end="00:48:08.670" style="s2">other characters I mean he does a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.870" end="00:48:10.110" style="s2">good job in some episodes and a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.670" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">bad job enough there is much like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.110" end="00:48:15.810" style="s2">prime directive it&#39;s for plot point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:17.400" style="s2">like well we need someone maybe react</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.810" end="00:48:19.710" style="s2">lead to this and for some reason you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.400" end="00:48:22.920" style="s2">in that position so let&#39;s have you react</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.710" end="00:48:24.660" style="s2">less like there&#39;s people I know now who</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.920" end="00:48:26.010" style="s2">would be much better leaders in that in</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:29.250" style="s2">that regard people who do have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.010" end="00:48:30.450" style="s2">interpersonal skills to like bring out</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.250" end="00:48:31.980" style="s2">people&#39;s net you know like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.450" end="00:48:33.450" style="s2">leadership style that&#39;s hierarchical and</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.980" end="00:48:35.190" style="s2">as a leadership style that like gets</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.450" end="00:48:38.520" style="s2">people to work together and finds your</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.190" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">key strengths and he&#39;s almost there</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.520" end="00:48:42.750" style="s2">he&#39;s like the 90s version of that but</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:45.360" style="s2">he&#39;s not there right like it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.750" end="00:48:47.460" style="s2">as the rest it&#39;s like 30 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.360" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">300 years in the future at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.460" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that combination of like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know why it&#39;s bringing to mind but</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:57.480" style="s2">there was an article when when Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.110" end="00:48:59.370" style="s2">and Hillary were running together that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.480" end="00:49:00.780" style="s2">said it was something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.370" end="00:49:01.740" style="s2">like you know talking about Hillary as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.780" end="00:49:04.320" style="s2">woman in her happy to go through</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.740" end="00:49:05.880" style="s2">politics as a woman and get media to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.320" end="00:49:07.320" style="s2">very masculine and it was like by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.880" end="00:49:10.830" style="s2">time the world was ready for like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.320" end="00:49:12.450" style="s2">female president we also were like way</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.830" end="00:49:14.280" style="s2">past Hillary like it&#39;s like we need</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.450" end="00:49:15.870" style="s2">Bernie and yet Bernie can only be Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.280" end="00:49:17.310" style="s2">because he&#39;s white and male and he was</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.870" end="00:49:19.260" style="s2">able to follow through on that through</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.310" end="00:49:21.960" style="s2">me he wouldn&#39;t be able to be a black</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.260" end="00:49:24.570" style="s2">woman and having had his history yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.960" end="00:49:26.580" style="s2">he&#39;s been I mean like help an allied to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.570" end="00:49:29.250" style="s2">like people in color and women and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.580" end="00:49:31.710" style="s2">know like gay the whole time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.250" end="00:49:33.150" style="s2">great and Hillary has if not and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.710" end="00:49:35.490" style="s2">like but at the same time she couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.150" end="00:49:37.620" style="s2">be and it was like that the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.490" end="00:49:40.040" style="s2">interplays like you can&#39;t like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.620" end="00:49:42.780" style="s2">evolved to the point where we can handle</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.040" end="00:49:44.460" style="s2">diversity but we also you need to be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.780" end="00:49:45.780" style="s2">certain age right to run for president</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.460" end="00:49:47.790" style="s2">and then you would have had to like go</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.780" end="00:49:49.890" style="s2">through that history and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.790" end="00:49:51.780" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that here it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.890" end="00:49:53.510" style="s2">okay thirty years in the past and 300</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.780" end="00:49:55.830" style="s2">years in the future</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.510" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very true and it&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.830" end="00:50:00.840" style="s2">your point about tokenism earlier we</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:02.760" style="s2">don&#39;t just want a female president for</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.840" end="00:50:07.110" style="s2">the sake of it it has to be eat the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.760" end="00:50:09.930" style="s2">right person yeah and it has to like but</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.930" end="00:50:14.280" style="s2">maybe the youngest we can have be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.310" end="00:50:15.690" style="s2">president and you know I just turned 40</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.280" end="00:50:17.790" style="s2">I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know if I want to throw</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.690" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">your own president but I also honestly</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.170" end="00:50:28.770" style="s2">brought up and it&#39;s like that very focus</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.540" end="00:50:33.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like we need someone who</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.770" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">think new and has been through some</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">host things don&#39;t necessarily coincide</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:52.950" style="s2">species evolving where we do have more</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.970" end="00:50:54.660" style="s2">capacity for diversity where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.950" end="00:50:56.670" style="s2">need someone to be an archetype to be a</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.830" end="00:53:02.350" style="s2">those those progressive steps forward</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.770" end="00:53:04.330" style="s2">you know like we&#39;re supposed to be part</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.350" end="00:53:06.370" style="s2">of kind of you know a universal trend</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.330" end="00:53:09.250" style="s2">you know so you can&#39;t rollback stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.370" end="00:53:11.400" style="s2">like that like it&#39;s but it&#39;s 2020 and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.250" end="00:53:16.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like world leaders that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.400" end="00:53:21.400" style="s2">homophobic like it&#39;s it&#39;s um yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:26.110" style="s2">racist and yes I mean package it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.400" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">so backwards you know in in this context</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.110" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking about about values</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:31.900" style="s2">that we ostensibly already have and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:34.450" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the future and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.900" end="00:53:36.700" style="s2">we get there and how we have peace and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.450" end="00:53:39.760" style="s2">then you have like world leaders like</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.700" end="00:53:43.180" style="s2">just embracing this whole package of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.760" end="00:53:45.210" style="s2">regressive reactionary ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">policies that like really hurt people</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.210" end="00:53:50.460" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:53.080" style="s2">yeah and I it is it&#39;s like both of them</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.460" end="00:53:54.910" style="s2">like there&#39;s a reason Trump and Brooks</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.080" end="00:53:57.640" style="s2">in all of these things are happening and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.910" end="00:54:00.550" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s reactionary and yet not</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.640" end="00:54:02.260" style="s2">reactionary it&#39;s very logical it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.550" end="00:54:04.990" style="s2">people are hurting and people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.260" end="00:54:06.850" style="s2">disconnected and addicted and all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.990" end="00:54:08.680" style="s2">these things at once and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.850" end="00:54:10.930" style="s2">yelling is spreading their anger onto</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.680" end="00:54:12.970" style="s2">whoever they can right instead of taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.930" end="00:54:14.560" style="s2">any ownership or leaving it up to people</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.970" end="00:54:17.500" style="s2">who actually have power and could</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.560" end="00:54:20.410" style="s2">actually do something about it and all</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.500" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">that at the same time it&#39;s like yelling</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.410" end="00:54:24.790" style="s2">at people to not be disenfranchised</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:26.860" style="s2">right no matter if you&#39;re like a white</p>

<p begin="00:54:29.320" end="00:54:32.560" style="s2">like you are and then people are like</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.520" end="00:54:33.910" style="s2">yelling at you that you&#39;re not and at</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.560" end="00:54:36.040" style="s2">the same time you know you are you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.910" end="00:54:38.110" style="s2">disconnected your poor your you name and</p>

<p begin="00:54:44.320" end="00:54:49.120" style="s2">and like you&#39;re not allowed to express</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.640" end="00:54:51.100" style="s2">your emotion and like it&#39;s so then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.120" end="00:54:52.540" style="s2">vote in Trump then you you blame it on</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.100" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">the people who don&#39;t look like you and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.540" end="00:54:55.269" style="s2">you it&#39;s like making them wrong for that</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:58.809" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.269" end="00:55:00.069" style="s2">their logical progression isn&#39;t solving</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.809" end="00:55:02.289" style="s2">the problem it&#39;s like you have to look</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.069" end="00:55:04.959" style="s2">at the root cause and like solve which</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.289" end="00:55:06.249" style="s2">is the post-scarcity world yeah that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.959" end="00:55:08.229" style="s2">can&#39;t get there with people in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.249" end="00:55:10.119" style="s2">mentality who are like no we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.229" end="00:55:12.219" style="s2">is take it back from them or like give</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.119" end="00:55:16.929" style="s2">me back the power that I had four years</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.219" end="00:55:18.759" style="s2">ago yeah would have done yeah the thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.929" end="00:55:21.189" style="s2">that I find shocking is not that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.759" end="00:55:22.929" style="s2">vote for Trump or for brexit like like</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.189" end="00:55:24.759" style="s2">you&#39;re saying like I get it there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.929" end="00:55:27.729" style="s2">sorts of practical reasons but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.759" end="00:55:30.279" style="s2">that&#39;s so shocking is that like leaders</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.729" end="00:55:33.939" style="s2">or intellectuals who you&#39;d think would</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.279" end="00:55:36.089" style="s2">know better really also buy into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.939" end="00:55:39.759" style="s2">kind of xenophobic narratives and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.089" end="00:55:41.919" style="s2">help along that right-wing movement you</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.759" end="00:55:45.069" style="s2">know it&#39;s like there&#39;s no I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.919" end="00:55:46.539" style="s2">no excuse for that like it well if</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.069" end="00:55:48.219" style="s2">there&#39;s enough people in the right wing</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.539" end="00:55:49.809" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna vote in people who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.219" end="00:55:53.469" style="s2">saying the things they wish they can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.809" end="00:55:54.909" style="s2">saying and I think a big part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.469" end="00:55:56.229" style="s2">the shadow side it&#39;s like well if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.909" end="00:55:58.089" style="s2">not allowed to say these things in</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.229" end="00:56:00.699" style="s2">public then both the leaders in who can</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.089" end="00:56:02.289" style="s2">say these things in public yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.699" end="00:56:05.109" style="s2">people have more freedom to actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.289" end="00:56:07.689" style="s2">express their their displeasure in every</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.109" end="00:56:09.249" style="s2">aspect of life and it wasn&#39;t broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.689" end="00:56:10.719" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t need to be one person</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.249" end="00:56:12.039" style="s2">saying that you&#39;re on a soapbox and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.719" end="00:56:14.469" style="s2">everyone freaks out because you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.039" end="00:56:16.989" style="s2">racist and homophobic but like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.469" end="00:56:18.819" style="s2">dictate that people don&#39;t have racist</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.989" end="00:56:22.059" style="s2">and homophobic thoughts and words</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.819" end="00:56:23.649" style="s2">because they do and so if we want them</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.059" end="00:56:25.509" style="s2">to get anywhere it they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.649" end="00:56:28.359" style="s2">allowed to express that without the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.509" end="00:56:30.249" style="s2">soapbox and unfortunately live in a very</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.359" end="00:56:31.719" style="s2">soapbox world or that&#39;s the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.249" end="00:56:34.539" style="s2">express anything right around the dinner</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.719" end="00:56:36.459" style="s2">table with your family or on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.539" end="00:56:39.009" style="s2">Internet and it&#39;s like there&#39;s a space</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.459" end="00:56:40.809" style="s2">between those two of like okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.009" end="00:56:43.539" style="s2">there needs to be a freedom to be able</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.809" end="00:56:45.369" style="s2">to say hey here&#39;s where I am I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.369" end="00:56:49.779" style="s2">matter it&#39;s like where I am yelling at</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.859" end="00:56:53.380" style="s2">me to be somewhere different isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.779" end="00:56:57.429" style="s2">get me there and and creating the spaces</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.380" end="00:56:59.859" style="s2">to make that doable without running for</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.429" end="00:57:02.439" style="s2">office honey like without like it played</p>
