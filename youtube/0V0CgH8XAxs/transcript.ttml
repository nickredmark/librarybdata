<p begin="00:11:27.580" end="00:11:30.340" style="s2">reasons as well wife we came to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.050" end="00:11:32.410" style="s2">United States because she wanted to be</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.510" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">independent mindset and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">if maybe it was the process or was it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:22.400" style="s2">that content that you are consuming at</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:24.680" style="s2">the time because you know that the tone</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.400" end="00:16:27.050" style="s2">and tenor of our pop culture has changed</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.680" end="00:16:29.390" style="s2">dramatically since the late 80s and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.050" end="00:16:31.250" style="s2">early nineties right right I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.390" end="00:16:33.230" style="s2">the content it was a big part of that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.250" end="00:16:34.610" style="s2">mean the 80s were really about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.230" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">you know the free market and free</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.610" end="00:16:38.210" style="s2">expression and just sorta came the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:39.080" style="s2">America it sort of started going back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.210" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">sort of a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.080" end="00:16:43.130" style="s2">version of the Wild West which I adored</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:44.680" style="s2">I loved the experience as a child I</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.130" end="00:16:47.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t know any better I didn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:47.990" style="s2">political or economic ramifications of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.000" end="00:16:49.880" style="s2">things that were happening around me</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.990" end="00:16:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s only five or six years old but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.880" end="00:16:54.500" style="s2">think for me the sort of the personality</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.400" end="00:16:57.590" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just a tea television it was also</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.500" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">like my family my mom was the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.590" end="00:17:02.570" style="s2">individual dimo sort of free speech she</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:05.060" style="s2">values free speech so much that she left</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.570" end="00:17:07.040" style="s2">her home country to come here</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.060" end="00:17:08.540" style="s2">to sort of be able to write I mean again</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:09.740" style="s2">the big part of the reason was the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:10.940" style="s2">that we could have died but also the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.740" end="00:17:12.140" style="s2">fact that she really wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.940" end="00:17:14.660" style="s2">writer and she couldn&#39;t be righter there</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.140" end="00:17:16.490" style="s2">it was completely banned right for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.660" end="00:17:18.980" style="s2">woman to write and publish her work in</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.490" end="00:17:21.380" style="s2">that country at that point not being</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.980" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">sort of a sort of a stooge of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.380" end="00:17:25.730" style="s2">fundamentalist Islamic government was</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:27.440" style="s2">completely banned so for me it was all</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.730" end="00:17:29.720" style="s2">about being able to express yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.440" end="00:17:31.910" style="s2">I had that for my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.720" end="00:17:33.800" style="s2">until I became it ironically I had that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.910" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">for my entire life until I became a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.800" end="00:17:40.340" style="s2">writer and then I was told to shut up</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:42.680" style="s2">no I first experienced really my first</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.340" end="00:17:45.050" style="s2">sort of experience for that really sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.680" end="00:17:47.270" style="s2">showed me this this bizarre need for</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.050" end="00:17:49.910" style="s2">people the status quo or the elites to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.270" end="00:17:51.380" style="s2">control or kind of dictate that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.910" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">language you can and can&#39;t use was in</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.870" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">of the mind and yeah I tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.970" end="00:24:05.790" style="s2">public school situation hasn&#39;t gotten</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.520" end="00:24:30.870" style="s2">what I&#39;ve chosen to do is rather than</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.380" end="00:24:33.660" style="s2">rather than fill my kids up with ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.870" end="00:24:35.820" style="s2">that they should believe or reject I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.660" end="00:24:39.000" style="s2">tried to just give them like a framework</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.820" end="00:24:41.250" style="s2">like well who&#39;s saying you know I always</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.660" end="00:24:57.960" style="s2">pretty much every question you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.070" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">so you know that situation hasn&#39;t gotten</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.550" end="00:25:24.540" style="s2">for the school paper because they</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.540" end="00:25:29.700" style="s2">I went to UCLA and at UCLA we have at</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.960" end="00:25:32.909" style="s2">the daily Bruin which is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.700" end="00:25:35.399" style="s2">status quo or traditional newspaper and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.909" end="00:25:37.109" style="s2">there was this young guy libertarian I</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.809" end="00:25:46.470" style="s2">the Bruins standard Bruins um so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.450" end="00:25:50.549" style="s2">sort of a take on the weekly standard</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.470" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">right Bob he relived Mikey yeah yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.549" end="00:25:53.909" style="s2">lot all right well no I like the weekly</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2">standard but anyway that&#39;s little debate</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.909" end="00:25:58.409" style="s2">this later but anyway so he he launched</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.820" end="00:25:59.580" style="s2">the paper and he said hey man were in</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.409" end="00:26:00.989" style="s2">class together and we&#39;re talking my</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.580" end="00:26:03.629" style="s2">Barry Bonds and steroids</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.989" end="00:26:05.190" style="s2">and house and the whole debate was I</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.629" end="00:26:07.379" style="s2">don&#39;t think very bond should be I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.190" end="00:26:08.849" style="s2">all Barry Bonds as Records should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.379" end="00:26:10.200" style="s2">wiped off the record books and Babe Ruth</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.849" end="00:26:11.489" style="s2">cheer hold all the home run records or</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.200" end="00:26:14.009" style="s2">Hank Aaron Cheryl you know all the home</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.489" end="00:26:15.539" style="s2">run records right um this is your I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.009" end="00:26:16.889" style="s2">think he&#39;s still a great baseball player</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.539" end="00:26:18.090" style="s2">I think he should still be in the Hall</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.889" end="00:26:20.099" style="s2">of Fame I think he&#39;s probably won the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.090" end="00:26:21.779" style="s2">top ten baseball players of all time but</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.099" end="00:26:22.769" style="s2">anyway we debated this back before</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.779" end="00:26:23.999" style="s2">things like you should write the paper</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.769" end="00:26:25.649" style="s2">so I start writing for the Bruins</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:41.669" style="s2">was just he could have really maintained</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.149" end="00:27:20.970" style="s2">and the internship was working for Tom</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:23.399" style="s2">Cruise&#39;s publicist very random</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.970" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">but they paid they paid and then I got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.399" end="00:27:28.139" style="s2">job through that and I was just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:30.690" style="s2">well I&#39;m getting paid ridiculous amounts</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.139" end="00:27:33.359" style="s2">of money for 20 was a 25 25 year old</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.690" end="00:27:34.679" style="s2">right I&#39;m just writing some do what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.359" end="00:27:35.700" style="s2">love I&#39;m writing I&#39;m getting paid a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.679" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">of money I&#39;ll just do this for a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.700" end="00:27:38.639" style="s2">years why should I go into journalism</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">and just be broke for the rest of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.639" end="00:27:42.570" style="s2">life so I took the capitalist route</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:44.580" style="s2">which ultimately was kind of a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.570" end="00:27:46.440" style="s2">believe it or not but I took that route</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.580" end="00:27:48.539" style="s2">and I was in public relations</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.440" end="00:27:51.330" style="s2">Communications I worked on campaigns I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.539" end="00:27:52.860" style="s2">work for like Nintendo Netflix and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.330" end="00:27:55.289" style="s2">like that for like about four years and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.860" end="00:27:58.169" style="s2">then and but but I was also writing for</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.289" end="00:27:59.429" style="s2">blogs during that time and what happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.169" end="00:28:01.169" style="s2">was that to kind of reconcile the two</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.429" end="00:28:02.309" style="s2">what do you want to do you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.169" end="00:28:03.980" style="s2">you want to be a writer or do you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.309" end="00:28:07.230" style="s2">to be someone who makes a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.980" end="00:28:09.779" style="s2">so I just went the writer route and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.230" end="00:28:11.250" style="s2">just chose the non money-making sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.779" end="00:28:12.539" style="s2">passion and what I and I just that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.250" end="00:28:13.769" style="s2">it I always wanted to express myself and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.539" end="00:28:15.029" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t express myself in PR I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.769" end="00:28:16.980" style="s2">remember there was this guy name is Ross</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.029" end="00:28:19.500" style="s2">Johnson you guys can look him up he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.980" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">like the PR guy for Wesley Snipes during</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.500" end="00:28:24.809" style="s2">the whole like advice was because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:26.700" style="s2">know you were the kind of person likes</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.809" end="00:28:29.399" style="s2">to release information not control it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.700" end="00:28:31.590" style="s2">and in mark we control information and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.399" end="00:28:32.549" style="s2">that was all I needed to hear and I went</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.590" end="00:28:35.490" style="s2">and I started releasing information</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.549" end="00:28:36.659" style="s2">little did I know now and the funny</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.490" end="00:28:38.009" style="s2">thing is little did I know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.659" end="00:28:39.629" style="s2">now been living in a world where like</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.009" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">journalism is all about controlling not</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.629" end="00:28:43.769" style="s2">releasing information which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">the tragedy I asked that up being you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.769" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">know perfectly trained to be journalists</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:49.049" style="s2">because really it is all just strictly</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">propaganda which I avoid but I could</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.049" end="00:28:53.399" style="s2">detect it really well right I called the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.769" style="s2">opaque wall of curation that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.399" end="00:28:58.200" style="s2">that they control they control it you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.769" end="00:28:59.730" style="s2">don&#39;t see it you can&#39;t see it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.200" end="00:29:01.529" style="s2">know what they choose to run or not run</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.730" end="00:29:03.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s really all about them just</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.529" end="00:29:06.120" style="s2">giving you the lens that they want it</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.330" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">that you do have and it&#39;s a it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.120" end="00:29:09.720" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;ve discovered</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:11.519" style="s2">the most getting into writing and just</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.720" end="00:29:14.370" style="s2">sort of circling in the in this network</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.519" end="00:29:16.139" style="s2">now which is that man there&#39;s the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.370" end="00:29:17.820" style="s2">know the writers know the journalists</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.139" end="00:29:20.039" style="s2">know the editors know the publisher</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.820" end="00:29:21.210" style="s2">knows the advertisers know they all know</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.039" end="00:29:23.850" style="s2">that the stuff is out there they just</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.210" end="00:29:24.889" style="s2">choose not to not to distribute it and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.850" end="00:29:26.789" style="s2">think that&#39;s really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.889" end="00:29:28.860" style="s2">comparison that you made between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.789" end="00:29:30.450" style="s2">difference between PR and marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.860" end="00:29:32.220" style="s2">advertisement and my communication</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.450" end="00:29:33.990" style="s2">strategy and especially man</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.220" end="00:29:36.269" style="s2">communications as a relates a government</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.990" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">officials holy which is control</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.269" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">information and rather than freeing up</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.059" style="s2">information which is which is what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">which is what you&#39;re all about man I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.059" end="00:29:44.820" style="s2">just see it the energy that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.110" style="s2">like coming right through coming right</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.820" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">through the microphone right it&#39;s in my</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.850" end="00:29:51.779" style="s2">feel it in your writing and I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.590" end="00:29:54.269" style="s2">imagine your subjects can feel it too</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.779" end="00:29:56.039" style="s2">when you&#39;re interviewing them I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.269" end="00:29:58.419" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty passionate about it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.039" end="00:30:01.720" style="s2">I saw I&#39;ve read back</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.509" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">everybody knows her name no one knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.669" end="00:30:15.879" style="s2">the backstory behind why I did that so</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">the reason I did that interviewer that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.879" end="00:30:19.179" style="s2">profile was because that this was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:20.919" style="s2">unique time in sort of Los Angeles where</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.179" end="00:30:22.749" style="s2">the third wave kind of feminist movement</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.919" end="00:30:24.970" style="s2">was taking over journalism in Los</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.749" end="00:30:27.210" style="s2">Angeles it really was aggressively had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.970" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">stranglehold on pretty much the entire</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.210" end="00:30:31.899" style="s2">journalistic sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:34.330" style="s2">environment and for me I viewed Sasha</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.899" end="00:30:36.129" style="s2">Grey as the kind of feminist that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.330" end="00:30:37.899" style="s2">admired growing up not that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.129" end="00:30:39.909" style="s2">fact that she was engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.899" end="00:30:41.499" style="s2">pornography or you know sexualizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.909" end="00:30:43.059" style="s2">herself had nothing to do with it for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.499" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">it was about a woman who took control of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.059" end="00:30:47.950" style="s2">her life decided to be who she wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">be ruthlessly and viciously and had no</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.950" end="00:30:51.970" style="s2">had zero concerns for what the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:53.710" style="s2">women around her were telling her how</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.970" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">she should behave how she should dress</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.710" end="00:30:57.639" style="s2">how she should talk and she was</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:30:59.559" style="s2">rejecting third wave feminism by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.639" end="00:31:01.629" style="s2">mere existence of being sasha grey and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.559" end="00:31:02.980" style="s2">not just that she would talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.629" end="00:31:04.690" style="s2">except she would never talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.980" end="00:31:06.249" style="s2">publicly because she was afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.690" end="00:31:07.539" style="s2">criticism and she didn&#39;t want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.249" end="00:31:08.950" style="s2">about it I mean one of the things I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.539" end="00:31:11.070" style="s2">go ahead and say this she had no</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.950" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">interest in going there with me and um</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.070" end="00:31:14.919" style="s2">yeah because it wasn&#39;t that she was</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:17.320" style="s2">afraid she just wanted to keep it fun</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.919" end="00:31:19.029" style="s2">she wanted to keep it very like engaging</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.320" end="00:31:20.889" style="s2">for her fans she didn&#39;t want to do a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.029" end="00:31:22.869" style="s2">divisive interview I touch space I took</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.889" end="00:31:24.609" style="s2">I talked about feminism with her but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.869" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s what she was for me she was</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.609" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">a vehicle to communicate what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:30.700" style="s2">was the essence of what I think is cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">about America is you could be whoever</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.700" end="00:31:35.049" style="s2">you want everybody be free live</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.669" end="00:31:42.940" style="s2">months brilliant to get her to commit</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.799" end="00:31:45.220" style="s2">yeah she did want she doesn&#39;t do those</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.940" end="00:31:47.769" style="s2">like if you look if you look up she did</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.220" end="00:31:48.789" style="s2">something for Vice I think after she</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.769" end="00:31:49.960" style="s2">does something for Vice you just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.789" end="00:31:51.909" style="s2">I&#39;m not doing this stuff anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.960" end="00:31:53.830" style="s2">she was she wasn&#39;t happy with with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.909" end="00:31:55.239" style="s2">results and yeah we just hung out we</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.830" end="00:31:57.759" style="s2">basically went on a date is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.239" end="00:31:59.859" style="s2">happened like we just Austin stably was</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.759" end="00:32:00.909" style="s2">a date a five or six hour date where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.859" end="00:32:02.259" style="s2">just hung out with her and asked her</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.909" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">questions about her little private life</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.259" end="00:32:06.909" style="s2">and right and it was a cowards turn on</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:08.169" style="s2">in like in the field kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.909" end="00:32:09.070" style="s2">thing and it was great we just went to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.169" end="00:32:11.289" style="s2">record store and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.070" end="00:32:12.040" style="s2">politics we talked about Trump we talked</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.289" end="00:32:14.290" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.040" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">feminism Russia she has a bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.290" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">relationship with the Russians I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.240" end="00:32:18.520" style="s2">talk about all this stuff and it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.820" style="s2">just one of the coolest things I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.520" end="00:32:23.650" style="s2">yeah do you think that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.820" end="00:32:25.780" style="s2">reason that she shied away from being</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.650" end="00:32:27.700" style="s2">overtly political with you was I</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.780" end="00:32:29.260" style="s2">understand not wanting it to go out to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.700" end="00:32:32.140" style="s2">her fans like that and be divisive but</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.260" end="00:32:33.670" style="s2">at the same time what it strikes me is</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.140" end="00:32:36.250" style="s2">that maybe that her feminism was</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.670" end="00:32:39.010" style="s2">authentic rather than performative right</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.250" end="00:32:41.890" style="s2">like she wasn&#39;t acting this way in order</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.010" end="00:32:45.100" style="s2">to like send a message she was just</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.890" end="00:32:47.170" style="s2">being her yeah and in in doing that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.100" end="00:32:51.010" style="s2">sent the message itself which to me is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.170" end="00:32:52.930" style="s2">like a much more appealing sort of mode</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.010" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">of behavior which definitely stands in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.930" end="00:32:56.890" style="s2">stark contrast to what I think we see</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:58.600" style="s2">happening today which is like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.890" end="00:33:00.520" style="s2">even think these crazy feminists the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.600" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">third or fourth wave feminists even</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.520" end="00:33:03.250" style="s2">believe half the that they say</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:04.510" style="s2">they&#39;re just out there sort of living</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.250" end="00:33:05.800" style="s2">out this role that they think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.510" end="00:33:08.890" style="s2">they&#39;re meant that they&#39;re meant to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.800" end="00:33:11.320" style="s2">perform and they and they like I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.890" end="00:33:13.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen him in up close like in action</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.320" end="00:33:15.310" style="s2">like at the Kavanagh hearing protests</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.270" end="00:33:17.890" style="s2">for example on up to the Supreme Court</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.310" end="00:33:19.780" style="s2">like I went and I was there periscoping</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.890" end="00:33:21.370" style="s2">and I was like face-to-face like I</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.780" end="00:33:23.560" style="s2">caught like right there and you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.370" end="00:33:25.300" style="s2">just see that they all feel you they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.560" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">been like taken over by like spirits</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.300" end="00:33:29.710" style="s2">like I&#39;m not not even exaggerating they</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.090" style="s2">they seem sort of detached from what</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.710" end="00:33:33.250" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.090" end="00:33:34.440" style="s2">floating through this experience that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.250" end="00:33:37.090" style="s2">they&#39;re having which is this</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.440" end="00:33:38.710" style="s2">demonstration of an idea through their</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.090" end="00:33:40.840" style="s2">behavior whereas it sounds like Sasha</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.710" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">Grey which makes her even a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.840" end="00:33:45.760" style="s2">cooler my book is like you know being</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:47.920" style="s2">herself and then letting that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.760" end="00:33:50.200" style="s2">become the politics I guess that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.920" end="00:33:52.090" style="s2">fine line to draw but it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.200" end="00:33:54.910" style="s2">that was a sounds like her a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.090" end="00:33:56.980" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s how I always viewed I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.910" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">believe in activism or protesting or</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.980" end="00:33:59.230" style="s2">demonstration I&#39;m not against that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:01.000" style="s2">people can do it if they want I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.230" end="00:34:03.850" style="s2">never do it myself and I find it to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.000" end="00:34:05.410" style="s2">sort of it always leads to to me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.850" end="00:34:07.270" style="s2">a caricature of someone who cares about</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.410" end="00:34:09.250" style="s2">things I think it becomes this weird</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.270" end="00:34:10.570" style="s2">emotional kind of cathartic experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.250" end="00:34:12.280" style="s2">for these people and they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.570" end="00:34:14.080" style="s2">getting anything done and I think if</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.280" end="00:34:16.540" style="s2">every individual just took it upon</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.080" end="00:34:18.280" style="s2">themselves to be what the change they</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.540" end="00:34:19.929" style="s2">wanted to see in the world or to be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.280" end="00:34:21.790" style="s2">feminist they want it to be or be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.929" end="00:34:23.230" style="s2">whatever the conservative you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.790" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">and just demonstrate through your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.230" end="00:34:25.659" style="s2">life and your own actions what you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.179" end="00:34:26.919" style="s2">the world to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.659" end="00:34:28.030" style="s2">like we&#39;d all be living in a better</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.919" end="00:34:29.770" style="s2">place the problem is we have these</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.030" end="00:34:32.619" style="s2">people who are obsessed with controlling</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.770" end="00:34:34.780" style="s2">the overall sort of voice or tenor or</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.619" end="00:34:36.909" style="s2">you know the the culture they live in</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.780" end="00:34:38.319" style="s2">and I think Sasha gray to me had no</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.909" end="00:34:41.079" style="s2">interest in that she was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.319" end="00:34:44.049" style="s2">against the third wave she was a free</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.079" end="00:34:46.389" style="s2">strong she had moxie she had bravado she</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.049" end="00:34:47.710" style="s2">had style she had fashion she was she</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.389" end="00:34:49.659" style="s2">was a kind of we have philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.710" end="00:34:51.159" style="s2">discussions that we kind of you know we</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.659" end="00:34:52.839" style="s2">talked about fuku and stuff like that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.159" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">had differences there but I think she</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.839" end="00:34:57.730" style="s2">was a kind of person that admired you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:35:01.000" style="s2">know Barbara Stanwyck or sort of the 30s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.730" end="00:35:02.530" style="s2">and 40s pre-code badass feminist the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:04.180" style="s2">woman that I grew up admiring the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.530" end="00:35:05.829" style="s2">wave the women who were strong and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.180" end="00:35:08.230" style="s2">ruthless and kind of loved and admired</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.829" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">their sexuality and and view women as</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.230" end="00:35:11.710" style="s2">women and men as men and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">beautiful sort of divide between us I</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.710" end="00:35:14.619" style="s2">think you know women knew how to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:15.910" style="s2">advantage of and men knew how to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.619" end="00:35:17.559" style="s2">advantage of when we both served Josh</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.910" end="00:35:19.000" style="s2">did the battle of sexes the battle of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.559" end="00:35:19.990" style="s2">the sexes was never a bad thing I</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.000" end="00:35:21.880" style="s2">thought it was a beautiful part of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.990" end="00:35:23.079" style="s2">human condition but there&#39;s this weird</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.880" end="00:35:24.579" style="s2">need to get rid of the battle of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.079" end="00:35:27.309" style="s2">sexes and make us all the same and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.579" end="00:35:29.279" style="s2">monoculture eyes everybody into this one</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.309" end="00:35:32.260" style="s2">kind of this like you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.279" end="00:35:33.400" style="s2">turn us into like the the alloys from HG</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.630" end="00:35:41.109" style="s2">disgusting you know and I&#39;ll never be</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.400" end="00:35:45.880" style="s2">able to accept that and food for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.109" end="00:35:47.500" style="s2">Morlocks too right so so you brought man</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.880" end="00:35:48.670" style="s2">he brought up a lot of stuff that I had</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.500" end="00:35:49.299" style="s2">on my list and I want to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.670" end="00:35:51.279" style="s2">about some</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.299" end="00:35:54.010" style="s2">we can definitely circle back to this</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.279" end="00:35:55.420" style="s2">equality of everything thing and one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.010" end="00:35:58.510" style="s2">the things well talk about right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.420" end="00:36:00.490" style="s2">second is the you said the battle of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.510" end="00:36:02.619" style="s2">sexes them women knew and the men knew</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.490" end="00:36:05.020" style="s2">it was just sort of the game right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.619" end="00:36:06.520" style="s2">women knew their power men knew that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.020" end="00:36:09.069" style="s2">women had that you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.520" end="00:36:10.450" style="s2">feminine power was they and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.069" end="00:36:12.099" style="s2">everybody sort of knew the rules of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.450" end="00:36:14.049" style="s2">game what&#39;s what&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.099" end="00:36:17.079" style="s2">dangerous about today I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.049" end="00:36:19.510" style="s2">there&#39;s no rules so we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.079" end="00:36:22.150" style="s2">what the rules of the game are so we</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.510" end="00:36:25.690" style="s2">can&#39;t even have this like a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.150" end="00:36:28.359" style="s2">complementary dance where both parties</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.690" end="00:36:31.089" style="s2">have a positive outcome instead it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.359" end="00:36:33.460" style="s2">like this free-for-all sort of anarchic</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.089" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">relationship anarchy dating mating</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.460" end="00:36:37.360" style="s2">anarchy</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:39.550" style="s2">and for me it was I got into writing</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.360" end="00:36:41.470" style="s2">about politics and culture from from</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.550" end="00:36:42.670" style="s2">writing about relationships it was the</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.060" end="00:37:19.330" style="s2">feminism thing is really bad for</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.500" end="00:37:21.940" style="s2">everybody it sounds kind of whiny after</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.330" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">a while but then but then then they just</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.330" end="00:37:29.470" style="s2">2x4 so many times that I finally decide</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.850" end="00:37:30.940" style="s2">to accept it that was that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.470" end="00:37:32.440" style="s2">the case and there&#39;s been a destruction</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.940" end="00:37:34.810" style="s2">of our norms and the destruction of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.440" end="00:37:37.450" style="s2">our dances and our rituals and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.810" end="00:37:39.550" style="s2">know the is going on yeah it is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.450" end="00:37:41.109" style="s2">is a strong opposition to traditional</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.550" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">values in a way and I think it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.109" end="00:37:43.900" style="s2">extreme so this is the thing I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:45.609" style="s2">FEMINIST I&#39;ve always been a feminist my</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.900" end="00:37:47.619" style="s2">mom was a feminist I grew up defines</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.609" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">define the word is how you&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.619" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">because I like to say that too and I get</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:52.330" style="s2">a lotta grief from people for saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:54.119" style="s2">that but define it well here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.330" end="00:37:56.590" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to I mean fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.119" end="00:37:58.780" style="s2">feminism is the idea that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.590" end="00:38:01.450" style="s2">at least politically and legally are</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.780" end="00:38:02.859" style="s2">equal that is to me the the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.450" end="00:38:04.210" style="s2">of it and we need to strive towards that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.859" end="00:38:05.109" style="s2">and we&#39;re almost there I think in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.210" end="00:38:06.130" style="s2">of ways I think there are still things</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.109" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">we need to work on this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.130" end="00:38:09.609" style="s2">disagree with some of the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.900" end="00:38:10.990" style="s2">anti-feminists tie people like I guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.609" end="00:38:12.550" style="s2">the Milo yu-na pelisses of the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.990" end="00:38:15.100" style="s2">right I do think that there are issues</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.550" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">we need to work through but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.100" end="00:38:18.730" style="s2">I think the the issue that I have with</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:21.609" style="s2">third the third wave specific and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.730" end="00:38:24.280" style="s2">second wave is that they chose to define</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.609" end="00:38:25.660" style="s2">feminism within their movement and say</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.280" end="00:38:28.660" style="s2">that this is how it works it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.660" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">monolithic movement we are the we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.660" end="00:38:31.840" style="s2">the deciders of what it means and what</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:33.460" style="s2">it&#39;s going to mean and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.840" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">follow you know fall in line with us</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.460" end="00:38:36.460" style="s2">you&#39;re misogynist period you are a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:37.690" style="s2">sexist you&#39;re women</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.690" style="s2">favorite writers to them yeah I grew up</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.070" end="00:38:48.000" style="s2">disagree with some of her hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.359" end="00:38:50.680" style="s2">kind of perspective on things</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.000" end="00:38:52.690" style="s2">fundamentally I love her right and so to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.680" end="00:38:54.940" style="s2">me they consider her a misogynist they</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.690" end="00:38:56.860" style="s2">consider her a problematic person and to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.940" end="00:38:58.900" style="s2">me if you consider Camille Paglia to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.860" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">an issue right uh and you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.900" end="00:39:02.500" style="s2">completely on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">universe but I try to break bread with</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.500" end="00:39:06.820" style="s2">all that I mean I have a lot my last</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:08.110" style="s2">girlfriend was an extreme anti-feminist</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.820" end="00:39:10.540" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.110" end="00:39:11.890" style="s2">she was um and she was literally at</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.540" end="00:39:13.930" style="s2">two-foot like in her mind I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.890" end="00:39:15.640" style="s2">if she was actually a member or go to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.930" end="00:39:16.660" style="s2">protest she would dress like them to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.640" end="00:39:18.130" style="s2">talk about I mean she was just one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.660" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">them we&#39;d fight every single day about</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.130" end="00:39:21.670" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:23.260" style="s2">we fight ruthlessly and viciously and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.670" end="00:39:24.850" style="s2">ultimately kind of like we can&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.260" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">together for too long because of it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.850" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">right I myself as a feminist and no one</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:30.250" style="s2">ever looked allowed me to view myself as</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:32.410" style="s2">a feminist which I always found really</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.250" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">weird because I want for men and women</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.410" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">what is the problem I have a different</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:36.580" style="s2">way of going about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:38.080" style="s2">I believe you should be about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.580" end="00:39:39.700" style="s2">individuals making their own choices and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.080" end="00:39:41.920" style="s2">being strong and being ruthless and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.700" end="00:39:44.530" style="s2">being brave and being independent and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.920" end="00:39:46.900" style="s2">not asking for special privileges but um</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.690" end="00:39:52.360" style="s2">let&#39;s just figure out and get there</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.740" end="00:39:54.340" style="s2">together but the Third Way was not</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.360" end="00:39:56.170" style="s2">willing to play ball they wanted well</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.340" end="00:39:58.380" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tough road to hoe</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.380" end="00:40:02.740" style="s2">anti-feminist but for a woman which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.250" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">sort of where I came down and I wrote in</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.990" end="00:40:12.040" style="s2">where I opened up with like okay I</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.780" end="00:40:34.600" style="s2">personality differences between men and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.550" end="00:40:36.280" style="s2">women and men and women have different</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.050" end="00:44:56.860" style="s2">voted for Hillary because he thought</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.860" end="00:45:00.580" style="s2">risk analysis and he saw that Trump we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.230" end="00:45:03.070" style="s2">need we couldn&#39;t predict Trump&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.529" end="00:48:38.950" style="s2">want to push back on this notion that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.089" end="00:48:42.369" style="s2">his rhetoric was somehow out of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.950" end="00:48:44.970" style="s2">ordinary I mean I have read I have read</p>

<p begin="00:49:16.329" end="00:49:20.529" style="s2">Republican Party was in 1920s right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.579" end="00:49:22.059" style="s2">the Democratic Party who&#39;s done yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.529" end="00:49:23.559" style="s2">mean so I mean everything is changed at</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.059" end="00:49:24.910" style="s2">the bit with Goldwater come in and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.559" end="00:49:26.619" style="s2">Goldwater&#39;s ideas for the party and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.910" end="00:49:27.910" style="s2">we had the transition to Reaganism and</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.619" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">and we had a transition that george w</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.230" end="00:49:37.299" style="s2">have changed but I think the last would</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">say 50 years in the context the last 50</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.299" end="00:49:42.039" style="s2">to 60 years Donald Trump is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:43.990" style="s2">his rhetoric is certainly outside the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.039" end="00:49:46.750" style="s2">norms it&#39;s certainly a shocking</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.990" end="00:49:49.780" style="s2">folks and I think look to the mag abase</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.750" end="00:49:51.430" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s the president they want the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.780" end="00:49:53.530" style="s2">problem I have with Trump is I think</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.530" end="00:49:56.380" style="s2">think he understands yet and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.090" end="00:49:57.550" style="s2">think he will I had to hope that he</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.380" end="00:49:59.830" style="s2">would because I said you know what my</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.550" end="00:50:01.330" style="s2">theory was let him let&#39;s let him prove</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.830" end="00:50:04.210" style="s2">himself to us don&#39;t judge him</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.330" end="00:50:05.710" style="s2">immediately give him a year what he does</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.210" end="00:50:07.210" style="s2">in a year will you know will foreshadow</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.710" end="00:50:09.160" style="s2">what he&#39;s gonna do for the rest of his</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.210" end="00:50:11.350" style="s2">presidency and what he&#39;s shown to me is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.160" end="00:50:12.460" style="s2">an incapability to be the president for</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.350" end="00:50:14.650" style="s2">the entire country</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.460" end="00:50:17.260" style="s2">and what the problem with him is he</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.650" end="00:50:18.820" style="s2">can&#39;t seem to every president when</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.260" end="00:50:21.040" style="s2">they&#39;re asked a question or when they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.590" end="00:59:05.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not filtering myself or censoring</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.510" end="00:59:07.420" style="s2">my so it&#39;s not self censoring at all</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.950" end="00:59:08.500" style="s2">it&#39;s more like well I thought of a</p>

<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.230" style="s2">sort of tendency to be cheeky and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.730" end="00:59:21.220" style="s2">kind of what I&#39;m doing there and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.220" end="00:59:24.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like when you he would do that a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.570" end="00:59:26.110" style="s2">lot I think I think it&#39;s awesome but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.460" end="00:59:27.550" style="s2">got a whole list of the shed to talk</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.550" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">thing but I wanted to ask you we had</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.320" end="00:59:32.470" style="s2">briefly touched on this what did you</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:36.340" style="s2">think of the Laura Loomer stunt last</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.470" end="00:59:38.170" style="s2">week what I think about the stunts</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.340" end="00:59:42.490" style="s2">that&#39;s such a complicated question I</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.170" end="00:59:44.410" style="s2">think that I liked I like the the fact</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.490" end="00:59:46.180" style="s2">that she was she got deep platform and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.410" end="00:59:48.790" style="s2">she was able to in this weird bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.180" end="00:59:50.740" style="s2">almost punk-rock way yeah hack her way</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.790" end="00:59:52.180" style="s2">back into Twitter yeah 24 hours and</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.740" end="00:59:55.480" style="s2">becomes the most talked about topic on</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.180" end="00:59:57.400" style="s2">Twitter I admire the sex pistol nosov</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.480" end="00:59:59.170" style="s2">that right but I think fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.400" end="01:00:00.790" style="s2">this is the reality I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.170" end="01:00:02.440" style="s2">conservatives and libertarians have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.790" end="01:00:04.120" style="s2">wake up and deal with and this is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.440" end="01:00:06.670" style="s2">not going to win this battle Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.120" end="01:00:08.440" style="s2">Facebook Google whatever it is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.670" end="01:00:10.630" style="s2">social media platforms as of right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.440" end="01:00:12.850" style="s2">are private companies they have a point</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.630" end="01:00:14.410" style="s2">of view just like Steve just like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.850" end="01:00:16.360" style="s2">know Tim Cook said today they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.410" end="01:00:17.830" style="s2">curating based on their ideology right</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.360" end="01:00:19.780" style="s2">that&#39;s just the way it is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.830" end="01:00:22.030" style="s2">have to play within their framework or</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.780" end="01:00:23.830" style="s2">reject it and leave if you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.030" end="01:00:25.570" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re being controlled or</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.830" end="01:00:27.460" style="s2">you&#39;re being sort of censored get off</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.570" end="01:00:29.230" style="s2">their platform right I get it I</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.460" end="01:00:30.610" style="s2">get it the sort of this change right</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.230" end="01:00:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the private company it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.610" end="01:00:33.900" style="s2">the it is the only way we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.810" end="01:00:36.370" style="s2">communicate to the masses at this point</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.900" end="01:00:37.990" style="s2">but you know and so that&#39;s sort of where</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.370" end="01:00:39.190" style="s2">I thought it would I thought the protest</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.990" end="01:00:41.110" style="s2">was ineffective I think again I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.190" end="01:00:43.869" style="s2">protest and activism in this form are</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.110" end="01:00:45.430" style="s2">ineffective they get nothing done I have</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.869" end="01:00:47.109" style="s2">actually I have more respect for lower</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.430" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">Loomer than probably anybody in my world</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.109" end="01:00:51.569" style="s2">would like me to have or whatever sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:54.910" style="s2">of forgive me for having I think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.569" end="01:00:56.829" style="s2">she&#39;s an activist okay but I do think</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.910" end="01:00:59.380" style="s2">that she goes out there and does dig and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.829" end="01:01:01.450" style="s2">does do reporting that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.380" end="01:01:03.940" style="s2">interesting and I think is brave and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.450" end="01:01:05.319" style="s2">think she has a lot of guts but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.940" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">think in terms of the protest</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.319" end="01:01:09.369" style="s2">ineffective pointless</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:10.450" style="s2">I think her wearing the Jewish star on</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.369" end="01:01:13.630" style="s2">the david star in her chest was</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.450" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">ridiculous if I was a Jew I&#39;m not a Jew</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.630" end="01:01:15.609" style="s2">and I think I thought was a Jew I</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:17.589" style="s2">probably would have been offended by</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.609" end="01:01:19.150" style="s2">that but I think you&#39;re sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.589" end="01:01:20.470" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of you&#39;re you you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.150" end="01:01:22.599" style="s2">it in a way that might have might be</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.470" end="01:01:24.430" style="s2">served deemed as being offensive or</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.599" end="01:01:27.400" style="s2">cheapening sort of what happened during</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.640" end="01:01:37.509" style="s2">before she blew up at all but back when</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.829" end="01:01:39.910" style="s2">she was still working at Project Veritas</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.509" end="01:01:42.460" style="s2">and she&#39;s always had a real hunger for</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.269" end="01:01:55.480" style="s2">the protests is sort of separate from</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.829" end="01:01:58.869" style="s2">her as a person and sort of stuck it</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.480" end="01:02:01.989" style="s2">from her as as a journalist or an</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.869" end="01:02:04.299" style="s2">activist or just a new media personality</p>

<p begin="01:02:34.809" end="01:02:38.140" style="s2">you know like attention is influenced</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.460" end="01:02:40.150" style="s2">and people want to talk about like Saul</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.140" end="01:02:43.390" style="s2">linski tactics and stuff like that but</p>

<p begin="01:03:01.319" end="01:03:05.579" style="s2">think it just sort of dug the hole</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.240" end="01:03:06.839" style="s2">little deeper unfortunately yeah nobody</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.579" end="01:03:08.579" style="s2">I know and here&#39;s a problem out with</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.839" end="01:03:10.589" style="s2">sort of the extremist activists like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.579" end="01:03:12.630" style="s2">Laura and I say this to you know I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.589" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">admire her as well many ways Kenneth</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.630" end="01:03:16.500" style="s2">Owens and I know I don&#39;t agree with her</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:18.599" style="s2">positions on a lot of issues but I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.500" end="01:03:19.859" style="s2">individuals like her I don&#39;t compare to</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.599" end="01:03:21.390" style="s2">Laura they&#39;re different but you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.859" end="01:03:22.650" style="s2">people like her even Tommy Lehren which</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.390" end="01:03:25.319" style="s2">I respect a lot of interviewed her</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.650" end="01:03:26.730" style="s2">before and she&#39;s you know I consider her</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.319" end="01:03:28.859" style="s2">a friend I think she&#39;s great but I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.730" end="01:03:30.089" style="s2">also realize that there&#39;s preaching till</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.859" end="01:03:31.619" style="s2">their acquired there&#39;s preaching to</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.089" end="01:03:34.020" style="s2">their fanbase and I think the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.619" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to sort of the way they</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.020" end="01:03:37.230" style="s2">communicate their messages it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:38.430" style="s2">impossible to get people on the left or</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.230" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">in the middle to even listen to you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.430" end="01:03:41.849" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:43.559" style="s2">get them to even their hearts and minds</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.849" end="01:03:46.290" style="s2">are completely blocked away from you and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.559" end="01:03:48.660" style="s2">for me what I try to do is I grew up</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.290" end="01:03:50.430" style="s2">reading Adam Burke and I grew up reading</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.660" end="01:03:52.200" style="s2">sort of I study foreign policy and</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.430" end="01:03:54.630" style="s2">diplomacy and for me it&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.200" end="01:03:56.430" style="s2">believe period in extremism I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.630" end="01:03:57.960" style="s2">extremism is a disease it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.430" end="01:03:59.700" style="s2">most horrific aspects of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.960" end="01:04:00.809" style="s2">happening under the Trump era I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.700" end="01:04:02.069" style="s2">Hillary Clinton would have caused it as</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.809" end="01:04:04.500" style="s2">well as president I don&#39;t think it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.069" end="01:04:06.420" style="s2">just just Donald Trump I do but I do</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.500" end="01:04:08.099" style="s2">think that we were headed there</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.420" end="01:04:10.109" style="s2">I don&#39;t think Trump I don&#39;t even Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.099" end="01:04:11.220" style="s2">president was Trump&#39;s decision I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.109" end="01:04:12.540" style="s2">we&#39;re headed towards that I think the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.220" end="01:04:14.309" style="s2">next president whether it&#39;s a liberal or</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.540" end="01:04:15.990" style="s2">Democrat is going to be a version of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.309" end="01:04:18.540" style="s2">Trump which which horrifies me by the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.990" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">way but anyway the point the larger</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.540" end="01:04:22.859" style="s2">point is I don&#39;t think activism works</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:24.599" style="s2">because activism is extreme I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.859" end="01:04:26.700" style="s2">diplomacy works I think negotiating</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.599" end="01:04:28.530" style="s2">works I think conversations you know I</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.700" end="01:04:30.390" style="s2">think sitting down with people that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.530" end="01:04:33.030" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with and having a smart calm</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.390" end="01:04:35.910" style="s2">and prudent and conversation that works</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.030" end="01:04:37.260" style="s2">I think real journalism works reporting</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.910" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">the facts and letting the letting the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.260" end="01:04:41.339" style="s2">readers decide for themselves where they</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:44.940" style="s2">stand on the issues and removing the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.339" end="01:04:47.069" style="s2">anxiety the pressure the guilt the meat</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.940" end="01:04:48.299" style="s2">the cruelty away from sort of the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.069" end="01:04:49.530" style="s2">idea of I&#39;m an activist is what I</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.299" end="01:04:51.780" style="s2">believe if you don&#39;t believe me you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.530" end="01:04:53.880" style="s2">part of the problem that perspective is</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.780" end="01:04:55.260" style="s2">not working anymore you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.880" end="01:04:56.910" style="s2">know if I necessarily agree with this</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.260" end="01:05:01.619" style="s2">position but I do know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.910" end="01:05:03.990" style="s2">that would say that trying to use facts</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.619" end="01:05:05.630" style="s2">and reason and persuasion and writing</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.990" end="01:05:07.609" style="s2">intelligently and</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.630" end="01:05:10.250" style="s2">the case and all this is what got</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.609" end="01:05:13.460" style="s2">conservativism in the position that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.250" end="01:05:16.819" style="s2">in now which is a dwindling majority</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.460" end="01:05:18.920" style="s2">down to minority like losing power I</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.819" end="01:05:21.109" style="s2">know I know it feels like you know with</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.920" end="01:05:22.970" style="s2">Trump in charge but like culturally</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.109" end="01:05:24.079" style="s2">conservative ISM is losing there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.970" end="01:05:25.279" style="s2">question about that</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.079" end="01:05:26.509" style="s2">yeah but Jack but Jack here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.279" end="01:05:28.039" style="s2">and I&#39;ve had this discussion with so</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.509" end="01:05:29.809" style="s2">many so many of the conservatives that</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.039" end="01:05:32.509" style="s2">say the same time the same point of view</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.809" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s conservatism is always losing power</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.509" end="01:05:35.660" style="s2">that is the sort of modus operandi of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:37.819" style="s2">being conservative</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.660" end="01:05:39.980" style="s2">throughout history progress is oh I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.819" end="01:05:41.509" style="s2">you could rebut Lee and to get the sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.980" end="01:05:44.210" style="s2">of it in you know any one of his books</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.509" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">or interviews conservatism x&#39; purpose is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.210" end="01:05:49.549" style="s2">never to control or to take over culture</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:51.559" style="s2">the holding the entire purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.549" end="01:05:55.039" style="s2">conservative ideology for me at least is</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.559" end="01:05:57.289" style="s2">to present sort of a barrier to progress</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.039" end="01:05:58.849" style="s2">running amok right the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.289" end="01:06:00.259" style="s2">we&#39;re here we&#39;re not here to win we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.849" end="01:06:01.400" style="s2">not here to you know I don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.259" end="01:06:02.990" style="s2">conservative society</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.400" end="01:06:04.009" style="s2">I want a society that&#39;s dead in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.990" end="01:06:05.720" style="s2">center because what I want is</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.009" end="01:06:06.950" style="s2">conservatives and people like me to</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.720" end="01:06:09.319" style="s2">present the opposition to progress</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.950" end="01:06:10.849" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely lost control and is</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.319" end="01:06:13.039" style="s2">actually running off the rails to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.849" end="01:06:14.690" style="s2">control it to hone it in and create a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.039" end="01:06:15.980" style="s2">society that we can all live in in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.690" end="01:06:17.779" style="s2">normal and sort of functional and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.980" end="01:06:19.039" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want tradition to be lost</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.779" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t want culture to be lost I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:22.460" style="s2">want the American or British Way of life</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:24.740" style="s2">to be completely flattened by</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.460" end="01:06:27.829" style="s2">globalization and so I think that but</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.740" end="01:06:29.660" style="s2">that to me isn&#39;t being a trump supporter</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.829" end="01:06:31.009" style="s2">or Maggert to me that is being a</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.660" end="01:06:32.630" style="s2">conservative in the sense that we are</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.009" end="01:06:34.369" style="s2">you know standing like Buckley said</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.630" end="01:06:36.289" style="s2">standing with support sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.369" end="01:06:38.809" style="s2">progress running headlong into a wall</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.289" end="01:06:40.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of my position on it</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.809" end="01:06:43.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not I don&#39;t want to win I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.670" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">want conservatism to ever win I want</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.160" end="01:06:47.960" style="s2">conservatism to prevent liberalism from</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:49.579" style="s2">destroying society that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.960" end="01:06:52.099" style="s2">perspective in that it sort of just</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.579" end="01:06:54.200" style="s2">assumes the fact that the progress in</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.099" end="01:06:55.490" style="s2">evolution is away from tradition I guess</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.200" end="01:06:58.039" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of how it is by definition</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.490" end="01:07:01.220" style="s2">right and that we&#39;re just compelled as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.039" end="01:07:03.259" style="s2">species to continue a hurt continually</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.220" end="01:07:05.839" style="s2">hurdle away from our past and our</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.259" end="01:07:08.390" style="s2">traditions I mean is that I know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.839" end="01:07:10.039" style="s2">as sufficiently read a student of</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.390" end="01:07:11.690" style="s2">history to be able to make a Blake in</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.039" end="01:07:14.420" style="s2">statement to say like oh well you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.690" end="01:07:16.940" style="s2">in no culture</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.420" end="01:07:20.809" style="s2">has progress not been like the defining</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.940" end="01:07:22.579" style="s2">characteristic or evolution or some sort</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.809" end="01:07:24.170" style="s2">of careening away from the traditions</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.579" end="01:07:25.250" style="s2">that had gotten the culture to where it</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.170" end="01:07:28.490" style="s2">was in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.250" end="01:07:30.740" style="s2">but I can certainly say that social</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.490" end="01:07:34.190" style="s2">media technology the internet</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.740" end="01:07:37.460" style="s2">connectivity etc the democratization of</p>

<p begin="01:07:41.869" end="01:07:46.940" style="s2">quotes here progress and so in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.630" end="01:07:50.150" style="s2">it then requires a more strident</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.940" end="01:07:52.369" style="s2">opposition and in order to sort of pull</p>

<p begin="01:13:00.540" end="01:13:04.530" style="s2">can incentivize us to move in this one</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.730" end="01:13:07.710" style="s2">direction or another dress right right</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.530" end="01:13:09.300" style="s2">and and rather than like the hard our</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.710" end="01:13:12.240" style="s2">core use of tariffs or taxes or other</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.300" end="01:13:16.260" style="s2">things and they kept saying I sounded</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.240" end="01:13:18.030" style="s2">like a leftist like like a was the one</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.260" end="01:13:21.030" style="s2">they were talking a Grigore for a local</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.030" end="01:13:22.530" style="s2">local sufficiency you know local food</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.030" end="01:13:23.760" style="s2">sovereignty that&#39;s what it was they kept</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.530" end="01:13:25.620" style="s2">saying that I sound like a food</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.760" end="01:13:26.970" style="s2">sovereignty guy which is like a radical</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.620" end="01:13:29.040" style="s2">leftist position that they were</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.970" end="01:13:30.180" style="s2">espousing there on campus and so because</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.040" end="01:13:31.650" style="s2">you&#39;re asking for government regulation</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.180" end="01:13:34.170" style="s2">right that&#39;s what that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.650" end="01:13:35.490" style="s2">their position yeah you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.170" end="01:13:37.380" style="s2">where I was going with it I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.490" end="01:13:39.900" style="s2">that we can incentivize our industries</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.380" end="01:13:42.090" style="s2">in order to push us in directions that</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.900" end="01:13:43.260" style="s2">we want to go you know I think that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.090" end="01:13:45.180" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want to go too deep into</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.260" end="01:13:47.760" style="s2">foreign trade and stuff right now but</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.180" end="01:13:49.500" style="s2">the we seem to think that China and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.760" end="01:13:50.750" style="s2">Japan and Korea and the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.500" end="01:13:52.310" style="s2">countries around the world are</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.750" end="01:13:54.200" style="s2">in the same framework that we are</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.310" end="01:13:56.570" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re operating in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.200" end="01:13:57.860" style="s2">accumulate capital framework right there</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.570" end="01:14:00.260" style="s2">basically mercantilist</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.860" end="01:14:02.510" style="s2">there they&#39;re the ones saving all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.260" end="01:14:04.190" style="s2">money we&#39;re the ones going into debt and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.510" end="01:14:05.750" style="s2">borrowing money and that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.190" end="01:14:08.090" style="s2">virtue of the way that the system was</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.750" end="01:14:09.980" style="s2">set up and so like I think that when I</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.090" end="01:14:12.620" style="s2">when I think about populism when I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.980" end="01:14:15.200" style="s2">about nationalism I think that we need</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.620" end="01:14:18.080" style="s2">to stop being beholden to the global of</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.200" end="01:14:20.120" style="s2">structures that that are based on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.080" end="01:14:22.220" style="s2">neoliberal trade policies that came out</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.120" end="01:14:24.680" style="s2">of the 90s but then like the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.220" end="01:14:26.540" style="s2">nations aren&#39;t actually participating in</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.680" end="01:14:28.010" style="s2">and so they&#39;re accumulating capital like</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.540" end="01:14:29.390" style="s2">what&#39;s the point of trade if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.010" end="01:14:31.130" style="s2">to accumulate capital if what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.390" end="01:14:32.780" style="s2">doing all the time is accumulating debt</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.130" end="01:14:34.490" style="s2">then something is going wrong and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.780" end="01:14:36.590" style="s2">they&#39;re all like they&#39;re all like</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.490" end="01:14:38.390" style="s2">picking and heating and clawing at us</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.590" end="01:14:42.470" style="s2">whereas we&#39;re just sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.390" end="01:14:44.120" style="s2">going deeper into debt now that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.470" end="01:14:45.230" style="s2">kind of populism and nationalism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.120" end="01:14:47.570" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s like trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.230" end="01:14:49.010" style="s2">reorient our goals right so I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.570" end="01:14:51.800" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of stuck on this idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.010" end="01:14:53.390" style="s2">that GDP growth uber alles is like the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.800" end="01:14:56.180" style="s2">only thing that we need to pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.390" end="01:14:58.490" style="s2">to but as we&#39;ve seen you know the loss</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.180" end="01:15:00.230" style="s2">of the Midwest and loss of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.490" end="01:15:01.700" style="s2">industrial belt and the Pauli&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.230" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">that are killing themselves with drugs</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.700" end="01:15:06.350" style="s2">and stuff now it&#39;s all because we had</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:08.870" style="s2">this focus on GDP is the only acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.350" end="01:15:10.460" style="s2">metric and GDP per capita who the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.870" end="01:15:12.010" style="s2">cares you take GDP divided by the</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.460" end="01:15:15.260" style="s2">population that doesn&#39;t tell me anything</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.010" end="01:15:19.610" style="s2">right what&#39;s it&#39;s time for us to start</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.260" end="01:15:22.100" style="s2">putting non economic data points as our</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.610" end="01:15:24.380" style="s2">goal like human data points like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.100" end="01:15:26.030" style="s2">life expectancy of huge chunks of our</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.380" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">country&#39;s going down every year for the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.030" end="01:15:28.460" style="s2">last couple of years that&#39;s insane we</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.440" end="01:15:30.650" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen anything like this for</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.460" end="01:15:33.890" style="s2">almost a century and so we need to start</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.650" end="01:15:35.960" style="s2">thinking about us as a human as humans</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.890" end="01:15:37.820" style="s2">rather than thinking about as GDP but so</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.960" end="01:15:39.500" style="s2">that to me is when I say populist and</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.820" end="01:15:40.820" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.500" end="01:15:42.350" style="s2">well I don&#39;t I don&#39;t entirely disagree</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.820" end="01:15:43.490" style="s2">with you this is where might this is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.350" end="01:15:45.050" style="s2">only place where I have sympathy with</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.490" end="01:15:46.820" style="s2">with sort of Magha moving I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.050" end="01:15:48.170" style="s2">don&#39;t the wall we can debate that if you</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.820" end="01:15:49.430" style="s2">want I have no sympathy for the magna</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.170" end="01:15:52.100" style="s2">movement there I have no sympathy for</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.430" end="01:15:54.350" style="s2">and I&#39;m not probing bordure either but I</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.100" end="01:15:56.900" style="s2">think yeah you I do agree that you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.350" end="01:15:59.090" style="s2">as I&#39;m out of tariff or you know an</p>

<p begin="01:15:59.090" end="01:16:02.450" style="s2">I started foreign policy when I was in</p>

<p begin="01:16:02.450" end="01:16:03.940" style="s2">what I&#39;ve always studied but I mean for</p>

<p begin="01:16:03.940" end="01:16:08.739" style="s2">I miss the idea that America used to</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.580" end="01:16:11.580" style="s2">make really good product America used to</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.739" end="01:16:13.390" style="s2">make very strong long-lasting cars</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.580" end="01:16:14.770" style="s2">refrigerators that were passed down from</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.770" end="01:16:18.930" style="s2">and all of a sudden because of freight</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.270" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">costs and globalization and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.930" end="01:16:24.190" style="s2">unfortunate consequences of extremists</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">and sort of out-of-control free trade we</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.190" end="01:16:28.449" style="s2">have these cheap products made in China</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.840" end="01:16:30.370" style="s2">China makes garbage and we buy it and we</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.449" end="01:16:31.750" style="s2">force it down our throats in our</p>

<p begin="01:16:31.750" end="01:16:36.640" style="s2">all trash I miss my hate in the USA and</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.540" end="01:16:37.840" style="s2">I agree with that I do think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.640" end="01:16:39.130" style="s2">way to get back to that now I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.840" end="01:16:41.380" style="s2">expert I don&#39;t know how to do that so</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.130" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">that&#39;s why I don&#39;t debate a lot of the</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:54.400" style="s2">Trump used which is the idea that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.600" end="01:16:56.590" style="s2">need to go back to coal and sort of fast</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.400" end="01:16:57.850" style="s2">this fantasy that you know coal country</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.800" end="01:21:00.760" style="s2">exactly like his show we even recorded</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.050" end="01:21:01.869" style="s2">the cameras weren&#39;t on but it was me</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.760" end="01:21:03.099" style="s2">sitting in a chair and him sitting in</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.869" end="01:21:05.050" style="s2">that chair the same chair you see when</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.099" end="01:21:06.790" style="s2">you watch the Reuben report and we just</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.050" end="01:21:08.590" style="s2">talked and debated there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.790" end="01:21:10.179" style="s2">debating I think what I try not to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.590" end="01:21:12.130" style="s2">with profiles and turn it into a debate</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.179" end="01:21:14.440" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t read well right so I</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.130" end="01:21:16.510" style="s2">mean in an ideal world I would love to</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.440" end="01:21:17.920" style="s2">sort of have done an interview with with</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.510" end="01:21:20.889" style="s2">Dave where we just mean him back and</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:21.969" style="s2">forth but you know a profile I thought</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.889" end="01:21:23.829" style="s2">was more interesting because then I</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.969" end="01:21:25.659" style="s2">could sort of chime in on my opinion of</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.829" end="01:21:27.010" style="s2">Dave Rubin and sort of talk about what</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.659" end="01:21:28.780" style="s2">he represents in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.010" end="01:21:31.000" style="s2">society we live in today my only problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.780" end="01:21:32.710" style="s2">with the criticism that he gets is I</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.000" end="01:21:34.750" style="s2">view what credit what criticism lately</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.710" end="01:21:37.179" style="s2">that out let&#39;s talk about it yeah my</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.750" end="01:21:38.980" style="s2">problem with it is I view Dave and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.179" end="01:21:40.780" style="s2">think they&#39;d sort of agrees with this I</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.980" end="01:21:44.800" style="s2">view him as a talk show host in the in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.780" end="01:21:47.619" style="s2">vein of a Leno or Fallon or Kimmel I</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.800" end="01:21:49.929" style="s2">don&#39;t view him as a political like</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.619" end="01:21:51.579" style="s2">activist or a voice in that world I mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.929" end="01:21:53.230" style="s2">he is to some extent but I don&#39;t view</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.579" end="01:21:55.329" style="s2">him that way I have a very solipsistic</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.230" end="01:21:56.739" style="s2">view of Dave Rubin and to me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.329" end="01:21:58.270" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to watch a show don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:21:58.270" end="01:22:01.270" style="s2">channel don&#39;t engage with this content</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.159" end="01:22:02.590" style="s2">if it bothers you if you don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.270" end="01:22:04.900" style="s2">fact that is interviewing people who are</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.590" end="01:22:05.980" style="s2">on the right or libertarians or you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.900" end="01:22:07.360" style="s2">there&#39;s some people that I thought that</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.980" end="01:22:08.770" style="s2">was a you know some of the some of some</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.360" end="01:22:09.849" style="s2">of his interviews I didn&#39;t agree with I</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.770" end="01:22:12.610" style="s2">told him I didn&#39;t like the Stephen</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.849" end="01:22:14.020" style="s2">Molyneux interview I thought you know he</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.610" end="01:22:15.610" style="s2">needs to push harder on Steven I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.020" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">Steven Wong use a charlatan and I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.610" end="01:22:19.179" style="s2">needs to be called out for some the very</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:20.380" style="s2">divisive and yeah yeah very divisive and</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.179" end="01:22:22.750" style="s2">dangerous things he says nothing like</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.380" end="01:22:25.599" style="s2">what he said quietly but I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.750" end="01:22:26.889" style="s2">let that go I mean it was in the article</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.599" end="01:22:27.880" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s in the article it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.889" end="01:22:29.079" style="s2">out there I think people should read it</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.880" end="01:22:30.310" style="s2">and sort of formulate their own can you</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.079" end="01:22:31.150" style="s2">know what I meant but I think the idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.310" end="01:22:32.829" style="s2">is that some of these ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.150" end="01:22:34.869" style="s2">extremist liberties an extremist</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.829" end="01:22:36.579" style="s2">libertarian yeah I he&#39;s a purist</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.869" end="01:22:37.810" style="s2">libertarian I&#39;m against is why I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.579" end="01:22:40.270" style="s2">conservative libertarian because I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.810" end="01:22:42.790" style="s2">curious libertarianism is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.270" end="01:22:44.350" style="s2">unrealistic and dangerous I think the</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.790" end="01:22:46.180" style="s2">idea that the foot</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.350" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">and his belief that he sort of feeds his</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.180" end="01:22:50.920" style="s2">followers that the government is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:52.840" style="s2">out to get everybody and his sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.920" end="01:22:54.760" style="s2">paranoid belief system the idea that for</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.840" end="01:22:56.800" style="s2">example eight he believes you know that</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.760" end="01:22:58.240" style="s2">was separate he doesn&#39;t word it exactly</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.800" end="01:22:59.560" style="s2">as such but and I&#39;m not gonna go into</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.240" end="01:23:01.060" style="s2">this exact verbage but the idea we</p>

<p begin="01:26:34.690" end="01:26:38.980" style="s2">possible and in that environment I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.760" end="01:26:40.809" style="s2">he hopes for some illumination into the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.980" end="01:26:42.429" style="s2">psychology of his guests that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.809" end="01:26:44.050" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to accomplish and to me</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.429" end="01:26:45.489" style="s2">that&#39;s profound and cool and I think I</p>

<p begin="01:26:45.489" end="01:26:49.929" style="s2">challenged my interviewers my subjects</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.770" end="01:26:51.789" style="s2">but and that&#39;s just me I&#39;m more I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="01:26:51.789" end="01:26:55.360" style="s2">of pugilist today I think Dave is like</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.949" end="01:26:57.550" style="s2">Miles Davis or something</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.360" end="01:26:59.469" style="s2">plays if he plays the horn he&#39;s smooth</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.550" end="01:27:01.090" style="s2">and he and actually I didn&#39;t Dave gets</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.469" end="01:27:03.130" style="s2">more other guys like Ben Shapiro if i</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.090" end="01:27:04.780" style="s2">sat down with deaf Ben Shapiro and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.130" end="01:27:07.389" style="s2">interviewed Ben Shapiro it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.780" end="01:27:09.340" style="s2">yelling match it would be be an ugly</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.389" end="01:27:10.810" style="s2">sort of even we would probably never get</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.340" end="01:27:12.969" style="s2">anywhere productive I think Dave got</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.810" end="01:27:16.350" style="s2">more out of than Shapiro on the gay cake</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.969" end="01:27:19.080" style="s2">issue then I think those people have got</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.350" end="01:27:22.780" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting sort of artistic</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.080" end="01:27:24.520" style="s2">viewpoint on on criticism coming from</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.780" end="01:27:28.170" style="s2">the the author or the narrator&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.520" end="01:27:30.340" style="s2">perspective and I think that Dave Rubin</p>

<p begin="01:27:30.340" end="01:27:34.780" style="s2">think I&#39;d have fun hanging out with him</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.869" end="01:27:36.400" style="s2">and you know I I&#39;m only sort of have mad</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.780" end="01:27:38.110" style="s2">respect for what he&#39;s been able to</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.400" end="01:27:40.960" style="s2">accomplish over the last few years and</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.110" end="01:27:44.110" style="s2">he&#39;s been a really powerful and positive</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.960" end="01:27:47.380" style="s2">force I think in our discourse but I</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.110" end="01:27:48.880" style="s2">mean I was he has a style where he sort</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.380" end="01:27:51.780" style="s2">of just lets the words speak for</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.880" end="01:27:55.449" style="s2">themselves the the his interviewees and</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.780" end="01:27:57.310" style="s2">it makes me think of when I saw wolf of</p>

<p begin="01:29:10.300" end="01:29:14.170" style="s2">usually not in that environment you</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.890" end="01:29:15.580" style="s2">don&#39;t look for a liberal right for</p>

<p begin="01:29:23.800" end="01:29:27.460" style="s2">Milo should be like where we are right</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.449" end="01:29:28.989" style="s2">now right like it&#39;s like on your</p>

<p begin="01:29:28.989" end="01:29:34.060" style="s2">microphone like they don&#39;t want him in</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.940" end="01:29:35.469" style="s2">that like oh my god a studio environment</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.060" end="01:29:37.570" style="s2">well you know this is gonna be on</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.469" end="01:29:39.550" style="s2">daytime TV now like it shocks it scares</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.570" end="01:29:41.469" style="s2">the out of the left when they see</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.550" end="01:29:43.060" style="s2">that and I think that he with his direct</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.469" end="01:29:44.920" style="s2">messages yeah sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.060" end="01:29:47.080" style="s2">he gets political in his direct messages</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.920" end="01:29:48.850" style="s2">but then he almost doesn&#39;t during the</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.080" end="01:29:51.070" style="s2">interview and I think that juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.850" end="01:29:52.600" style="s2">for meas television right I&#39;m like whoa</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.070" end="01:29:54.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a TV show if I don&#39;t want to watch</p>

<p begin="01:29:54.730" end="01:29:59.199" style="s2">that juxtaposition horrifies and</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.460" end="01:30:00.820" style="s2">terrifies and sort of makes liberals</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.199" end="01:30:03.100" style="s2">feel very uncomfortable because they see</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.820" end="01:30:05.320" style="s2">it as they see that sort of this like</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.100" end="01:30:08.020" style="s2">weird he&#39;s walking the fine line between</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.320" end="01:30:10.239" style="s2">propaganda and entertainment for them I</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.020" end="01:30:11.800" style="s2">don&#39;t think yes I don&#39;t think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.239" end="01:30:13.840" style="s2">propagandistic at all he&#39;s not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.800" end="01:30:16.330" style="s2">converse anybody but I do think that he</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.840" end="01:30:17.410" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s a complicated format no</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.330" end="01:30:18.880" style="s2">one&#39;s ever seen the show before has</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.410" end="01:30:20.710" style="s2">there ever been a show like before no</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.880" end="01:30:23.650" style="s2">never exists I don&#39;t think so especially</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.710" end="01:30:25.420" style="s2">especially it&#39;s such long form too I</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.650" end="01:30:29.050" style="s2">mean holy cows sometimes they go for</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.420" end="01:30:30.250" style="s2">hours nobody watches to the left they</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.050" end="01:30:31.750" style="s2">don&#39;t watch these interviews they just</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.250" end="01:30:33.310" style="s2">get the snippets that some idiot dropped</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.750" end="01:30:35.140" style="s2">on the internet and they&#39;re like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.310" end="01:30:36.850" style="s2">god he didn&#39;t push back on Milo when he</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.140" end="01:30:39.400" style="s2">said something about like you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.850" end="01:30:42.040" style="s2">whatever it was but he&#39;s like push back</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.400" end="01:30:43.960" style="s2">like 80% like 60 60 70 % that Milo</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.040" end="01:30:45.100" style="s2">interview was a really productive and</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.960" end="01:30:47.949" style="s2">interesting conversation there are</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.100" end="01:30:49.330" style="s2">moments where it was bad and those</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.949" end="01:30:51.910" style="s2">moments were the only things we ever saw</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.330" end="01:30:52.929" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that&#39;s the sad sort of</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.910" end="01:30:56.290" style="s2">byproduct of the Internet</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.929" end="01:30:58.120" style="s2">yeah so uh what do you think I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.290" end="01:30:59.650" style="s2">get to the Milo piece but when was that</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.120" end="01:31:02.280" style="s2">and what do you what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.650" end="01:31:06.340" style="s2">the recent happenings with him because</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.280" end="01:31:08.530" style="s2">you know I remember 2015 Milo exploding</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.340" end="01:31:11.560" style="s2">onto this at least to me exploded onto</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.530" end="01:31:12.020" style="s2">my scene and I first became aware of him</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.560" end="01:31:17.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.020" end="01:31:19.970" style="s2">I loved his energy I loved the I look I</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.960" end="01:31:21.530" style="s2">like being provoked you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.970" end="01:31:22.940" style="s2">thought it was provocative and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.530" end="01:31:24.650" style="s2">it was interesting I went and saw him</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.940" end="01:31:28.250" style="s2">speak you know I&#39;ve met him a few times</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.650" end="01:31:29.960" style="s2">and you know I think he sort of he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.250" end="01:31:31.850" style="s2">sort of lost the plot in a big way but</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.960" end="01:31:34.100" style="s2">you know and and then the money things</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.850" end="01:31:36.620" style="s2">and then you know apparently he owes</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.100" end="01:31:38.690" style="s2">people millions of dollars and I&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.620" end="01:31:40.160" style="s2">people that he owes money to personally</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.690" end="01:31:42.680" style="s2">that have done work for him and that he</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.160" end="01:31:45.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t pay and then he goes around like</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.680" end="01:31:47.930" style="s2">flashing these like $10,000 you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.260" end="01:31:50.690" style="s2">lunch receipts and whatever and and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.930" end="01:31:52.400" style="s2">my question to you is like how what what</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.690" end="01:31:54.080" style="s2">you know do you think that&#39;s good I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.400" end="01:31:57.020" style="s2">just kidding what my questions my</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.080" end="01:31:59.120" style="s2">question to you is is a is to what</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.020" end="01:32:01.730" style="s2">extent has his social media de</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.120" end="01:32:03.650" style="s2">platforming like been been a negative to</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.730" end="01:32:06.530" style="s2">his power do you think he has any</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.650" end="01:32:08.540" style="s2">influence how has he been able to cope</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.530" end="01:32:10.610" style="s2">outside of the Twitter banning or what</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.540" end="01:32:12.940" style="s2">do you see for the future there or does</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.610" end="01:32:16.310" style="s2">he have relevance is Milo still relevant</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.940" end="01:32:17.840" style="s2">how self question I think that Milo with</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.310" end="01:32:20.690" style="s2">his cult following is always gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.840" end="01:32:22.910" style="s2">relevant in that world I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.690" end="01:32:24.620" style="s2">think he sort of detached himself and</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.910" end="01:32:26.920" style="s2">has been sort of forcibly removed from</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.620" end="01:32:29.480" style="s2">any sort of pipeline to the mainstream I</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.920" end="01:32:30.950" style="s2">think if he ever is exposed or talked</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.480" end="01:32:33.110" style="s2">about in the mainstream now it&#39;s purely</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.950" end="01:32:35.510" style="s2">to just remind people of you know that</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.110" end="01:32:36.770" style="s2">he&#39;s you know a white supremacist or a</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.510" end="01:32:42.170" style="s2">Nazi which he&#39;s not he&#39;s none of those</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.770" end="01:32:44.300" style="s2">things I spent I spent two weeks on a</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.170" end="01:32:47.060" style="s2">know over a month probably on and off</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.300" end="01:32:49.940" style="s2">with Milo I was in Miami I stayed in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.060" end="01:32:52.370" style="s2">mansion for five or six days I think I</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.940" end="01:32:56.180" style="s2">spent days with him in Los Angeles and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.370" end="01:32:58.400" style="s2">spend days with them in New York I spent</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.180" end="01:33:01.310" style="s2">a lot of time with Milo and we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.400" end="01:33:03.650" style="s2">like friends but I talked to him</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.310" end="01:33:05.090" style="s2">consistently for about a few months all</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.650" end="01:33:07.220" style="s2">the things people say about him are</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.090" end="01:33:08.870" style="s2">really hard to so for me to compromise</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.220" end="01:33:10.880" style="s2">or sort of reconcile because I know the</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.870" end="01:33:13.790" style="s2">guy versus the the character he plays on</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.880" end="01:33:15.740" style="s2">TV right great and I and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.790" end="01:33:19.670" style="s2">into my piece I said that he&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.740" end="01:33:21.350" style="s2">he&#39;s playing a character the real Miley</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.670" end="01:33:22.550" style="s2">innopolis is really hard to know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.350" end="01:33:23.900" style="s2">almost impossible to know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.550" end="01:33:25.860" style="s2">Oscar Wilde we don&#39;t know the real Oscar</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.900" end="01:33:28.320" style="s2">while we only know Oscar Wilde</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.860" end="01:33:30.119" style="s2">wanted us to know he wore many masks and</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.320" end="01:33:32.460" style="s2">I think Milo wears many masks I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.119" end="01:33:34.080" style="s2">the biggest problem with that is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.460" end="01:33:36.719" style="s2">world we live in now people are like you</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.080" end="01:33:38.130" style="s2">said a craving authenticity excuse me</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.719" end="01:33:41.159" style="s2">they&#39;re craving they&#39;re craving an</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.130" end="01:33:44.850" style="s2">honest voice and I think Milo was so</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.159" end="01:33:46.889" style="s2">sort of playing this bizarre heavy-metal</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.850" end="01:33:49.139" style="s2">conservative kind of character the sex</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.889" end="01:33:50.340" style="s2">pistol that I think he lost himself in</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.139" end="01:33:52.440" style="s2">the character is very pro wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.340" end="01:33:54.659" style="s2">right it&#39;s like he played the gimmick so</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.440" end="01:33:56.369" style="s2">hard that he became the gimmick mom and</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.659" end="01:33:57.540" style="s2">I think that he lost himself in that in</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.369" end="01:34:00.719" style="s2">that shuffle but I think he&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.540" end="01:34:02.580" style="s2">intelligent guy I think at his core deep</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.719" end="01:34:04.710" style="s2">down inside good guy he was a gentleman</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.580" end="01:34:06.659" style="s2">he was gentleman to me the entire time I</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.710" end="01:34:08.699" style="s2">was there every interaction I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.659" end="01:34:11.760" style="s2">had with him he was nothing but a</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.699" end="01:34:13.139" style="s2">gentleman to me so I went on one don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.760" end="01:34:14.820" style="s2">have any problems the guy never treated</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.139" end="01:34:17.250" style="s2">me bad never insulted me</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.820" end="01:34:18.750" style="s2">never did I mean he did sort of he did</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.250" end="01:34:19.800" style="s2">sort of I don&#39;t know there were things</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.750" end="01:34:21.300" style="s2">that I thought were sort of weird</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.800" end="01:34:22.530" style="s2">whatever the way you treat a journalist</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.300" end="01:34:24.869" style="s2">or a reporter but I think that&#39;s his own</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.530" end="01:34:26.639" style="s2">that&#39;s his own prerogative but I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.869" end="01:34:27.989" style="s2">that he&#39;s a sweet guy he you know he was</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.639" end="01:34:31.409" style="s2">a sweet guy to me I don&#39;t know what he</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.989" end="01:34:32.909" style="s2">is in real life but my only concern is I</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.409" end="01:34:35.219" style="s2">think that when you push people to the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.909" end="01:34:37.650" style="s2">fringes the way we have when you isolate</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.219" end="01:34:39.360" style="s2">them when you get rid of their you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.650" end="01:34:40.830" style="s2">Twitter you get rid of your YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.360" end="01:34:43.260" style="s2">channel you get rid of their platforms</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.830" end="01:34:46.230" style="s2">to communicate you make them even more</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.260" end="01:34:49.980" style="s2">extreme you so radicalize them to even</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.230" end="01:34:51.480" style="s2">more fundamentally dangerous level and I</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.980" end="01:34:53.100" style="s2">think the problem is what worries me is</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.480" end="01:34:54.980" style="s2">people like Milo the more we create</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.100" end="01:34:57.300" style="s2">those kind of people that we push away</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.980" end="01:34:59.670" style="s2">the more they&#39;ll kind of come together</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.300" end="01:35:01.230" style="s2">and the Morrie&#39;s is the day when like 40</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.670" end="01:35:03.030" style="s2">or 50 different models come together and</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.230" end="01:35:05.100" style="s2">they mask the following and create sort</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.030" end="01:35:07.290" style="s2">of their own little they&#39;re all a little</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.100" end="01:35:08.639" style="s2">monster right they become a Frankenstein</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.290" end="01:35:10.020" style="s2">that we don&#39;t want it we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.639" end="01:35:11.219" style="s2">Frankenstein&#39;s and I think we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.020" end="01:35:14.190" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen in the future and it</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.219" end="01:35:17.219" style="s2">scares me yeah yeah the interesting you</p>

<p begin="01:35:17.219" end="01:35:22.050" style="s2">thought was his chance to really it was</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.860" end="01:35:24.119" style="s2">like a test it was like if he did well</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.050" end="01:35:26.340" style="s2">yeah if he did well on that the doors</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.119" end="01:35:28.050" style="s2">were gonna open to him right but he</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.340" end="01:35:30.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t I think he really that one</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.050" end="01:35:30.960" style="s2">up I feel like he was like it looked</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.000" end="01:35:33.300" style="s2">like he was on drugs</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.960" end="01:35:34.980" style="s2">he didn&#39;t dress the part he didn&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.300" end="01:35:36.719" style="s2">the part even though Bill Maher kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.980" end="01:35:38.550" style="s2">enjoyed him while he was on the show I</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.719" end="01:35:40.150" style="s2">felt like it was just a missed</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.550" end="01:35:43.449" style="s2">opportunity for Milo</p>

<p begin="01:37:28.719" end="01:37:33.219" style="s2">control it now they hate what&#39;s happened</p>

<p begin="01:37:33.219" end="01:37:37.390" style="s2">fact that it has created individual</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.230" end="01:37:39.370" style="s2">voices and has empowered individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.390" end="01:37:40.480" style="s2">you know you met you brought it up but</p>

<p begin="01:37:40.480" end="01:37:46.390" style="s2">think about this Tim Cook statement that</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.540" end="01:37:49.300" style="s2">it&#39;s he used religious terms he says the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.390" end="01:37:52.230" style="s2">CEO of Apple says it would be a sin to</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.300" end="01:37:54.570" style="s2">not deep platform voices of hate</p>

<p begin="01:37:56.340" end="01:37:59.280" style="s2">basically this is an announcement he</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.750" end="01:38:01.830" style="s2">made yesterday what do you make a - it</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.280" end="01:38:02.910" style="s2">was a few issues I had with us first of</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.830" end="01:38:04.560" style="s2">all he said that he said the technology</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.910" end="01:38:06.480" style="s2">should have a point of view I completely</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.560" end="01:38:08.910" style="s2">disagree I think technology should be a</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.480" end="01:38:10.739" style="s2">platform or a tool for anyone to use</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.910" end="01:38:12.810" style="s2">however there&#39;s a hammer have a</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.739" end="01:38:15.300" style="s2">point of view yeah it&#39;s ridiculous I</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.810" end="01:38:16.980" style="s2">think that sense he says that Apple&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.300" end="01:38:19.080" style="s2">gonna curate technology based on their</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.980" end="01:38:21.780" style="s2">point of view well Apple needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.080" end="01:38:23.970" style="s2">very what needs to happen is a police to</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.780" end="01:38:25.320" style="s2">release a memo or a document outlining</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.970" end="01:38:27.480" style="s2">their point of view distinctly and</p>

<p begin="01:38:34.530" end="01:38:42.000" style="s2">only issue is the idea is that they get</p>

<p begin="01:50:14.670" end="01:50:17.730" style="s2">the feminist point extreme time this</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.960" end="01:50:19.380" style="s2">point of view is definitely wrong and he</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.730" end="01:50:21.210" style="s2">knew extreme anti-feminist point of view</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.380" end="01:50:24.090" style="s2">on this extreme I think we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.210" end="01:50:26.190" style="s2">figured out yet the sort of levels of</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.090" end="01:50:27.960" style="s2">where there&#39;s biology or sort of</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.190" end="01:50:30.420" style="s2">societal norms and culture and</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.960" end="01:50:32.460" style="s2">propaganda and you know marketing and</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.420" end="01:50:34.200" style="s2">advertising and how that&#39;s affected the</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.460" end="01:50:36.480" style="s2">fact that yeah there are women are not</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.200" end="01:50:38.400" style="s2">going into certain fields with the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.480" end="01:50:39.720" style="s2">frequency of men and men are not going</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.400" end="01:50:41.190" style="s2">in certain fields with the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.720" end="01:50:42.780" style="s2">frequency of women and these fields are</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.190" end="01:50:45.060" style="s2">not necessarily masculine or feminine</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.780" end="01:50:47.850" style="s2">fields right I mean I understand for</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.060" end="01:50:49.650" style="s2">example like not not as many men will</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.850" end="01:50:50.820" style="s2">ever go into like hair and makeup as</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.650" end="01:50:53.580" style="s2">women that&#39;s probably not going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.820" end="01:50:55.290" style="s2">happen in history it just doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.580" end="01:50:58.770" style="s2">to because that is a specific feminine</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.290" end="01:51:00.360" style="s2">you know product but I do think user</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.770" end="01:51:01.920" style="s2">questions we got to try to answer right</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.360" end="01:51:03.900" style="s2">and these are we&#39;re not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.920" end="01:51:05.820" style="s2">answering them as much as we are</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.900" end="01:51:07.830" style="s2">fighting to sort of protect our like</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.820" end="01:51:09.090" style="s2">we&#39;re being tribal we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.830" end="01:51:09.670" style="s2">protect our point of view on the matter</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.090" end="01:51:11.110" style="s2">without try</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.670" end="01:51:13.210" style="s2">figure out well why our women are going</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.110" end="01:51:14.949" style="s2">into why our wire is made why weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.210" end="01:51:16.960" style="s2">there in history or why are there now as</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.949" end="01:51:18.610" style="s2">many women going into sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.960" end="01:51:19.989" style="s2">hard labor jobs it&#39;s a physically</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.610" end="01:51:21.070" style="s2">daunting experience right so their</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.989" end="01:51:22.810" style="s2">argument is that women are not as</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.070" end="01:51:23.370" style="s2">physically capable as men to go into</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.810" end="01:51:26.020" style="s2">those fields</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.370" end="01:51:28.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a fair point of view but women</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.020" end="01:51:29.560" style="s2">can still go into those fields and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.060" end="01:51:31.390" style="s2">know work around the physical and sort</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.560" end="01:51:32.920" style="s2">of you know the physical you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.390" end="01:51:34.630" style="s2">handicap they might have but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.920" end="01:51:37.300" style="s2">know I think there the I want equality</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.630" end="01:51:37.840" style="s2">and I want people to be free to make</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.300" end="01:51:39.850" style="s2">choices</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.840" end="01:51:42.160" style="s2">I do think advertising and marketing and</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.850" end="01:51:44.290" style="s2">sort of corporate America has presented</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.160" end="01:51:46.690" style="s2">a handicap to men and women to go into</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.290" end="01:51:52.929" style="s2">certain fields I do believe that well</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.690" end="01:51:54.370" style="s2">you are you are a feminist I could I</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.929" end="01:51:56.440" style="s2">could push back on that one for hours we</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.370" end="01:51:59.290" style="s2">could talk about that in detail but I</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.440" end="01:52:00.280" style="s2">want to move on I want to move on I know</p>

<p begin="01:53:54.790" end="01:54:00.010" style="s2">the most primal masculine and he in many</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.240" end="01:54:02.430" style="s2">ways actually androgynous because he</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.010" end="01:54:06.130" style="s2">wasn&#39;t Rogers but also he was such a</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.430" end="01:54:07.960" style="s2">wild rabid just a savage and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.130" end="01:54:10.480" style="s2">was so intrigued by this guy who was</p>

<p begin="01:54:39.310" end="01:54:42.580" style="s2">problem I thought was happening was the</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.840" end="01:54:44.920" style="s2">LA Weekly was entirely focusing on hip</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.580" end="01:54:47.650" style="s2">hop and it was entirely focusing on sort</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.920" end="01:54:50.470" style="s2">of this sort of like woke bizarre</p>

<p begin="01:56:23.860" end="01:56:29.020" style="s2">I&#39;m not a big fan of Howard Zinn&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.750" end="01:56:30.340" style="s2">but it is in a way sort of like the</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.020" end="01:56:32.290" style="s2">people&#39;s history of the United States in</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.340" end="01:56:34.030" style="s2">the sense that it&#39;s showing the sight of</p>

<p begin="01:56:49.750" end="01:56:53.890" style="s2">so it&#39;s really a book about that uh</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.050" end="01:56:55.860" style="s2">interesting that you brought up the</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.890" end="01:56:58.060" style="s2">androgynous nature of Axl Rose</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.860" end="01:56:59.770" style="s2">immediately I thought of Mick Jagger and</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.060" end="01:57:01.090" style="s2">David Bowie and then I may I immediately</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.770" end="01:57:03.220" style="s2">thought of Camille Paglia</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.090" end="01:57:05.650" style="s2">like she she has written extensively</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.220" end="01:57:09.850" style="s2">about David Bowie and like his androgyny</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.650" end="01:57:11.590" style="s2">and what it meant to her how what did</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.850" end="01:57:13.300" style="s2">you observe in Nashville Rose that made</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.590" end="01:57:15.100" style="s2">you say that terms of the androgyny was</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.300" end="01:57:18.850" style="s2">it just like the hair was that the dress</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.100" end="01:57:20.980" style="s2">was it amorphous sexuality like what was</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.850" end="01:57:23.740" style="s2">it about that because I agree and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.980" end="01:57:26.410" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how rock and roll</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.740" end="01:57:29.500" style="s2">figures the leads of a rock and roll</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.410" end="01:57:32.160" style="s2">band like people that chicks really love</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.500" end="01:57:36.010" style="s2">and are you know heroes to boys and</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.160" end="01:57:37.870" style="s2">guitar players are can be androgynous</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.010" end="01:57:39.300" style="s2">yet and then people still are like wow</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.870" end="01:57:41.800" style="s2">this is really cool</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.300" end="01:57:43.180" style="s2">yeah I mean I mean the androgynous sort</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.800" end="01:57:44.680" style="s2">of aspect of junior I didn&#39;t discover</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.180" end="01:57:46.810" style="s2">until later when I was really young I</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.680" end="01:57:47.800" style="s2">didn&#39;t really I&#39;m am 8 years old 9 years</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.810" end="01:57:49.780" style="s2">old I didn&#39;t really know the difference</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.800" end="01:57:52.510" style="s2">I just saw this guy who had long hair</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.780" end="01:57:54.280" style="s2">right he wore some makeup he wore</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.510" end="01:57:56.890" style="s2">clothing that showed his like his body</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.280" end="01:57:58.720" style="s2">parts off right um he was doing sexually</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.890" end="01:58:01.210" style="s2">sore suggestive movements that to me was</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.720" end="01:58:02.740" style="s2">androgynous cuz as a guy in the world</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.210" end="01:58:04.780" style="s2">and I grew up in a very traditional sort</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.740" end="01:58:05.860" style="s2">of environment no men didn&#39;t do those</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.780" end="01:58:07.540" style="s2">kind of things there weren&#39;t men with</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.860" end="01:58:08.860" style="s2">long hair there were men who were makeup</p>

<p begin="01:58:08.860" end="01:58:12.850" style="s2">spandex clothing she didn&#39;t exist so</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.840" end="01:58:14.140" style="s2">that to me automatically was shocking I</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.850" end="01:58:17.680" style="s2">was like why is he dressed like a girl</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.140" end="01:58:19.780" style="s2">but like he was it was so rebellious to</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.680" end="01:58:21.310" style="s2">me because again I didn&#39;t know about the</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.780" end="01:58:24.760" style="s2">Sunset Strip Harry metal scene I was too</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.310" end="01:58:26.710" style="s2">young so to me that was just and I I</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.760" end="01:58:29.890" style="s2">discovered Guns N&#39;Roses like probably in</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.710" end="01:58:32.650" style="s2">like God man the late late 80s early 90s</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.890" end="01:58:34.600" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t know about the Sunset Strip</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.650" end="01:58:36.280" style="s2">and poison and all that and to me it was</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.600" end="01:58:37.960" style="s2">just wow like this guy looks different</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.280" end="01:58:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s shocking it&#39;s frightening</p>

<p begin="01:58:40.720" end="01:58:43.600" style="s2">the out of me in a weird way and I</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.190" end="01:58:46.810" style="s2">thought that was that&#39;s why I was drawn</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.600" end="01:58:47.740" style="s2">to he sounds like a banshee man yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.810" end="01:58:49.870" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m drawn to some political</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.740" end="01:58:51.130" style="s2">people that I sort of will retweet often</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.870" end="01:58:53.560" style="s2">that people get really mad at me about I</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.130" end="01:58:55.600" style="s2">won&#39;t say who they are but they scare me</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.560" end="01:58:57.940" style="s2">to some extent because they&#39;re so bold</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.600" end="01:58:59.740" style="s2">and so extreme it&#39;s so sort of just</p>

<p begin="01:58:59.740" end="01:59:04.030" style="s2">are in this bizarre sort of ruthless</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.050" end="01:59:06.070" style="s2">kind of individualistic almost like</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.030" end="01:59:08.410" style="s2">Barbara Stanwyck and babyface where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.070" end="01:59:10.150" style="s2">just like I&#39;m conquering and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.410" end="01:59:13.240" style="s2">gonna give in to sentiment I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.150" end="01:59:15.550" style="s2">give in to any sort of decency or norms</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.240" end="01:59:18.100" style="s2">and I think Axl Rose to me was that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.550" end="01:59:19.420" style="s2">not that anymore at all but he was that</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.100" end="01:59:21.400" style="s2">at that point and that that was the</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.420" end="01:59:23.140" style="s2">allure did he change did you change that</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.400" end="01:59:25.870" style="s2">the world changed well how is he not</p>

<p begin="01:59:27.250" end="01:59:30.100" style="s2">people who&#39;s actually become more</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.240" end="01:59:32.290" style="s2">probably more progressive as I&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.100" end="01:59:34.420" style="s2">older I was way more conservative when I</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.290" end="01:59:36.310" style="s2">was young and I became extremely</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.420" end="01:59:38.800" style="s2">conservative when I was like in college</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.310" end="01:59:42.850" style="s2">in high school my pamphlet for Bush in</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.800" end="01:59:44.260" style="s2">high school so I was just I mean I look</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.850" end="01:59:44.860" style="s2">at myself then and I think wow what was</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.260" end="01:59:46.390" style="s2">wrong with me</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.860" end="01:59:49.090" style="s2">right my point of view</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.390" end="01:59:50.650" style="s2">were just you know I was for going into</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.090" end="01:59:52.630" style="s2">Iraq until I was against it when we</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.650" end="01:59:55.030" style="s2">actually went into Iraq that was for the</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.630" end="01:59:56.710" style="s2">invasion of Iraq before Bush became</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.030" end="01:59:58.000" style="s2">president that&#39;s one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.710" end="02:00:01.690" style="s2">voted for Bush because I wanted him to</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.000" end="02:00:03.220" style="s2">go into Iraq but in the aftermath of it</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.690" end="02:00:05.110" style="s2">I was a complete against that war so I</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.220" end="02:00:05.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t change I became even more open to</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.110" end="02:00:08.470" style="s2">sort of those kind</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.920" end="02:00:09.910" style="s2">I think ax roses he&#39;s gotten older has</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.470" end="02:00:11.410" style="s2">been more insulated and more isolated</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.910" end="02:00:13.420" style="s2">from sort of the working class and the</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.410" end="02:00:16.120" style="s2">normal certain normal society I think</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.420" end="02:00:17.530" style="s2">he&#39;s become a limousine liberal you know</p>

<p begin="02:08:32.700" end="02:08:34.770" style="s2">glimmer</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.120" end="02:08:37.800" style="s2">like there I&#39;ll give you an example it</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.770" end="02:08:39.270" style="s2">was a band in los angeles who got banned</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.800" end="02:08:40.950" style="s2">from playing shows in LA they were</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.270" end="02:08:42.450" style="s2">banned completely because the because of</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.950" end="02:08:45.720" style="s2">their name the band was called black</p>

<p begin="02:08:48.870" end="02:08:52.530" style="s2">but they were banned from playing venues</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.460" end="02:08:54.210" style="s2">in Los Angeles there her name so I mean</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.530" end="02:08:56.310" style="s2">that to me was sort of a transgressive</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.210" end="02:08:57.870" style="s2">move but musically the problem here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.310" end="02:08:59.700" style="s2">problem it&#39;s a lot of great rock and</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.870" end="02:09:00.900" style="s2">rollers endless amounts of great rock</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.700" end="02:09:02.220" style="s2">bands coming out they&#39;re underground</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.900" end="02:09:04.020" style="s2">they&#39;re not being promoted by the media</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.220" end="02:09:05.610" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t fit the agenda the</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.020" end="02:09:07.860" style="s2">media because the media is trying to</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.610" end="02:09:09.090" style="s2">push this whole intersectional diversity</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.860" end="02:09:11.460" style="s2">quota so like they&#39;re gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.090" end="02:09:13.200" style="s2">hip hop they&#39;re gonna talk about you</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.460" end="02:09:14.940" style="s2">know you know just like NPR&#39;s list</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.200" end="02:09:16.440" style="s2">yesterday PR listed the ten best albums</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.940" end="02:09:18.990" style="s2">of the year right yesterday right okay</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.440" end="02:09:20.880" style="s2">all ten were by women I mean every</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.990" end="02:09:25.170" style="s2">single every single one of them every</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.880" end="02:09:28.410" style="s2">single one and so to me that&#39;s okay but</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.170" end="02:09:30.390" style="s2">do you for one second believe that every</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.410" end="02:09:32.190" style="s2">single the top ten records are all by</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.390" end="02:09:33.480" style="s2">women that are there no records by men</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.190" end="02:09:35.430" style="s2">are we just saying that we want to</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.480" end="02:09:37.680" style="s2">create this list to promote this idea</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.430" end="02:09:38.940" style="s2">that women are it&#39;s the woman&#39;s year in</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.680" end="02:09:41.130" style="s2">music or whatever it&#39;s been the woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.940" end="02:09:42.660" style="s2">ear music since 2012 as far as I mean</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.130" end="02:09:44.940" style="s2">it&#39;s always been that I mean look at our</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.660" end="02:09:47.220" style="s2">pop stars how many great male pop stars</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.940" end="02:09:50.040" style="s2">can you name Ed Sheeran Justin Bieber</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.220" end="02:09:52.230" style="s2">and it and it ends just a bit of Justin</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.040" end="02:09:53.850" style="s2">Timberlake yeah but he&#39;s he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.230" end="02:09:55.890" style="s2">basically finished I know he&#39;s real like</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.850" end="02:09:57.330" style="s2">you know he&#39;s he hasn&#39;t really done much</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.890" end="02:09:58.500" style="s2">his last album was kind of a laughing</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.330" end="02:10:00.750" style="s2">stock of like pop music</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.500" end="02:10:02.070" style="s2">he&#39;s like bizarrely fading away but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.750" end="02:10:04.410" style="s2">really just all women it&#39;s like Lady</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.070" end="02:10:06.780" style="s2">Gaga now it&#39;s all female pop stars I</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.410" end="02:10:08.730" style="s2">mean women have a real stranglehold on</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.780" end="02:10:11.970" style="s2">pop music and music in general right now</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.730" end="02:10:13.410" style="s2">which i think is cool and fine but the</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.970" end="02:10:15.540" style="s2">problem I had with that is from the</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.410" end="02:10:17.790" style="s2">media when the media takes it upon</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.540" end="02:10:20.070" style="s2">themselves to be you know activism and</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.790" end="02:10:22.470" style="s2">music in music journalism to me was the</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.070" end="02:10:25.170" style="s2">most horrific thing I saw growing up in</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.470" end="02:10:26.400" style="s2">LA because music to me is apolitical I</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.170" end="02:10:27.000" style="s2">mean you could be political the music</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.400" end="02:10:28.980" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.000" end="02:10:31.200" style="s2">the music itself to be political but the</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.980" end="02:10:34.260" style="s2">coverage of the music to me should</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.200" end="02:10:36.030" style="s2">always be agenda like agenda free it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.260" end="02:10:38.040" style="s2">about allowing the artist to communicate</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.030" end="02:10:39.660" style="s2">to their audience not communicating the</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.040" end="02:10:41.940" style="s2"> message of the artist in your</p>
