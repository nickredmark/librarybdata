<p begin="00:20:21.570" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">interesting anymore we already did it -</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.990" end="00:20:35.279" style="s2">there you go this is what the machines</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.299" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">have done to us what I like is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.279" end="00:20:46.110" style="s2">about your your story here is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:47.990" style="s2">you&#39;re not naively progressive and at</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.110" end="00:20:51.029" style="s2">the same time you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.990" end="00:20:54.120" style="s2">conservative or to try to tell us that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.029" end="00:20:55.889" style="s2">we need to get back to something you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:20:55.889" end="00:20:59.070" style="s2">you&#39;re going forward but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.179" end="00:21:02.639" style="s2">saying we need this deep anthropology -</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.070" end="00:21:03.870" style="s2">I talked about two new things I took one</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.639" end="00:21:05.879" style="s2">thing from the past we have the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.870" end="00:21:08.580" style="s2">which is still on us so it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.879" end="00:21:09.000" style="s2">from the past mm-hmm the past is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.580" end="00:21:11.669" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.000" end="00:21:13.399" style="s2">it&#39;s the no other interest and to learn</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.669" end="00:21:15.720" style="s2">from it where we&#39;re gonna go next</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.399" end="00:21:18.330" style="s2">completely focused on the future meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.720" end="00:21:20.909" style="s2">only what we take with us which is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.330" end="00:21:23.789" style="s2">memory of our own bodies which is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.909" end="00:21:25.590" style="s2">social biological evolutionary program</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.789" end="00:21:27.330" style="s2">that worked in the original tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.590" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">that we still have to carry with us for</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.330" end="00:21:30.899" style="s2">the foreseeable future</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:32.669" style="s2">including our bodies that are not fit</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.899" end="00:21:36.570" style="s2">for space travel sorry Ellen</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.669" end="00:21:38.909" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna happen so oh yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.570" end="00:21:41.909" style="s2">what we need to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.909" end="00:21:44.549" style="s2">the rest is machines who I do not</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.909" end="00:21:47.220" style="s2">particularly care about if they&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.549" end="00:21:50.970" style="s2">or not they&#39;re not alive these machines</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.220" end="00:21:53.730" style="s2">here to service when you you you start</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.970" end="00:21:56.639" style="s2">your ethics a lot of young guys out</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.730" end="00:21:59.009" style="s2">there are tempted to be life centric or</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.639" end="00:22:00.929" style="s2">biocentric or you know because they want</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.009" end="00:22:03.240" style="s2">to be kind to cows whatever they want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.929" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">be crew or anything like that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.240" end="00:22:07.289" style="s2">matter because even if your life centric</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">you&#39;re still anthropocentric you start</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.289" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">with humans right</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:10.500" style="s2">you&#39;re a human being you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.500" end="00:22:15.420" style="s2">and no it&#39;s nobody except human beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.500" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">are gonna talk to you or listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:20.190" style="s2">you&#39;ll be involved with your</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.450" end="00:22:25.800" style="s2">human being it&#39;s because of you and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.800" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">myself if a big cockroach or probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.800" end="00:22:28.740" style="s2">the cockroaches that was a dunker</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">probably be decided with the donkey&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.740" end="00:22:33.690" style="s2">but know you that means to try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:35.610" style="s2">include other species or things like</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.690" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">that in your ethics and say life is more</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.610" end="00:22:38.910" style="s2">important than being human but at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:40.740" style="s2">end of the day it&#39;s gonna be like okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.910" end="00:22:44.460" style="s2">so you&#39;re gonna kill a human to save a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.740" end="00:22:46.350" style="s2">dolphin why would we care about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.460" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">you&#39;re just being a scared little boy is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.350" end="00:22:51.450" style="s2">afraid of confronting the honest factual</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">truth the truth is that we are human and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.450" end="00:22:56.070" style="s2">we are talking to each other as unions</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:58.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not a humanist</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.070" end="00:23:01.530" style="s2">I&#39;m an anti-humanist like Nietzsche I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.740" end="00:23:04.470" style="s2">know perfectly well a human is not a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.530" end="00:23:07.110" style="s2">sacred humans are not gods</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.470" end="00:23:09.060" style="s2">we just happen to be species it happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.110" end="00:23:11.250" style="s2">at least to think that it wants to live</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.060" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">and happens to think that it has some</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.250" end="00:23:16.470" style="s2">kind of consciousness although that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:17.910" style="s2">very available and this creature is the</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.910" end="00:23:22.890" style="s2">talking to ourselves and other humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.710" end="00:23:26.730" style="s2">and then the question is this one the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.890" end="00:23:29.080" style="s2">planet is there for us we are not there</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.730" end="00:23:30.760" style="s2">for the planet</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.080" end="00:23:33.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not there to serve a certain</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.160" end="00:23:37.480" style="s2">goddess is only because it put a name on</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:40.060" style="s2">the container because we have to find a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.480" end="00:23:42.430" style="s2">sustainable way for us as humans to live</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.060" end="00:23:45.370" style="s2">on this planet if that&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.430" end="00:23:47.770" style="s2">harmony imbalance for God&#39;s sake it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.370" end="00:23:48.820" style="s2">about sustainability in itself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.770" end="00:23:51.160" style="s2">pure for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.820" end="00:23:53.620" style="s2">we we might just as well try to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.160" end="00:23:56.410" style="s2">climate disaster if we can we should do</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.620" end="00:23:58.210" style="s2">our utmost to do that because we also</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.410" end="00:24:02.890" style="s2">have to then later learn how to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.210" end="00:24:06.190" style="s2">the next Ice Age mmm-hmm we have to turn</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.890" end="00:24:09.970" style="s2">the planet into garden instead of wild</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.190" end="00:24:13.090" style="s2">nature if you&#39;re gonna contain a planet</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.970" end="00:24:16.300" style="s2">with tens or twenty or thirty billion</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.090" end="00:24:18.340" style="s2">people on it yeah no kidding yeah yeah</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">more intelligent world than what we had</p>
