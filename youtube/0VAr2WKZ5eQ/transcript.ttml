<p begin="00:00:07.759" end="00:00:12.320" style="s2">and in a lot of different circles who</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">are interested in processing</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.320" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">what they call sense making in this new</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">time that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">he&#39;s been talking about the shift</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:22.960" style="s2">in how we should process things and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:25.119" style="s2">shift in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.960" end="00:00:26.480" style="s2">institutions and then of course with</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.119" end="00:00:29.439" style="s2">this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.480" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">that conversation is even more pressing</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">your background though and how did you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">get involved in this these these topics</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:42.879" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:44.320" style="s2">online about people are watching you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing you engage with other</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.320" end="00:00:47.840" style="s2">thinkers like-minded folks trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">think ahead of the curve and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:52.320" style="s2">see what&#39;s coming along that the human</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:54.160" style="s2">species needs to get prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">but where how did you start on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.160" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">um well i suppose maybe this to me keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">it compact to keep it simple</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:08.560" style="s2">um you might say that i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">uh i&#39;m a dilettante well</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">or polymath depending on your preference</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:19.119" style="s2">and i have an attraction to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">a certain class of kind of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.119" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">also kind of doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">so in the context of thinkers the names</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:25.520" style="s2">that came up we were just just before we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">started recording we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.520" end="00:01:29.439" style="s2">mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:32.079" style="s2">so you might see that i&#39;m a an applied</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">and applied mcluhanite</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.079" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2">but equally john boyd is somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve been very influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">which is optimal when applied</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">um another philosopher manuel delanda</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve also been very attracted to his</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">um there&#39;s a few more you could throw in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:53.680" style="s2">but if you kind of get the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">those kinds of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:57.759" style="s2">you know i just i like to read and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">always have and was reading those</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.759" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">those kinds of thinkers relatively young</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:05.920" style="s2">that&#39;s one side and the other side when</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">i say applied i mean applied so i</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.920" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">was involved in three startup companies</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">that went public</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:16.239" style="s2">in the latter part of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">earlier part of the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">all in the context of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">so the first was called np3.com if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">recall music</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">the second was a company called</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">interview which ultimately was purchased</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">a company called akamai which you may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">and the third was called divex which</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.760" style="s2">played a major role in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">making the internet a visual medium so</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.760" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">all this video that we&#39;re doing whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">it&#39;s watching youtube videos or</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">doing zoom calls was uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">kicked into gear at least meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">by the work that we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">um and and it&#39;s sort of a way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">a sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">i think in 2004 maybe 2003</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">kind of in the middle of my my divex arc</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">um i bought</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">two two books from manuel de landa</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">and gave copies to like 150 people</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">uh including my entire uh executive team</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s a good sense of like this notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">of having a uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">a copy of uh de lloys and qatari</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">on my lap as i was sitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">waiting room to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">um sergey brin about google making an</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">offer to buy my company so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">combination because kind of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">that that sensibility that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">pretty good concrete sitting</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">in the lobby waiting to go talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">sergey about buying div x</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">um while reading um maybe it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">lawyers maybe it was a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">repetition i can&#39;t remember exactly but</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">you kind of get the gist so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a nice compact example</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">that gives you the the sensibility of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.799" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">um maybe one last piece is i&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">actually sitting on my family&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">hilltop ranch in the texas hill country</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">um and we&#39;ve been spending roughly half</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">my time in what you might call thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">and mostly these days actually turning a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">lot of the thinking that&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">over the past 10 years into</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">strategic planning around what might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">trajectories from now</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">uh and the other half you know planting</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">raised bed gardens and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">moving limestone rocks from one place to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">another place so you&#39;re homesteading and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">all that kind of thing huh</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s not a new thing we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">actually have an actual homestead</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">and is there a particular reason for</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">because of where you think things are</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">heading or just because of the pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">and the desire to live that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">lifestyle the pleasure and desire to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">live that kind of lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">good but that&#39;s that&#39;s do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">all human beings should live</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">close to that if not doing it directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">but being</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">close to people who are homesteading and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">providing products and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">milk the word large</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">logical category right do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">natural for human beings to go into</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">subterranean cattle cars and be shifted</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">back and forth into big cities where</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">you know definitely not natural i would</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">go further to say it&#39;s also prob</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">almost certainly not healthy right um so</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">if i were to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">like the way i would say it is more like</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">almost everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">and for a sizable fracture in the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">should be doing the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">that are part of the evolutionary arc</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">of humans so staring at the fire</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">um instead of staring electric lights</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">and touching earth and planting things</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">and being</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">in sync with the the rhythms of weather</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">like you should know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">what the weather&#39;s like outside without</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">checking an app on your phone those are</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">much in terms of heuristics and not in</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">um categorical structures right do you</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">that uh do you see a similar uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">dynamic going on with what peter thiel</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">talks about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve had this great stagnation</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">since the 1970s and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">you know after we did the man on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">moon the last uh the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">moon mission we kind of seemed like we</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">stalled and we&#39;ve become more interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">in innovating in the world of what he</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">bits rather than atoms uh that all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">you know when we think of technological</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">progress it&#39;s always in the world of ai</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">or computer apps rather than in physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">innovation and because of that great</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">stagnation in atoms</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re in this kind of state</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">of madness that we&#39;re in where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">we&#39;re we don&#39;t know how to get along</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">anymore and we don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">uh you know process conflict in healthy</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">ways do you see that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">yeah sure in fact to be very specific um</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">i&#39;ve known eric weinstein for gosh</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">almost 15 years now something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">some significant amount of time before</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">he met peter and um i used to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:03.280" style="s2">to simplify things by just saying 1977.</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously hyper simplistic but</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.280" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">yeah very much very much so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">line somewhere in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">where something very significant changed</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">and so yes i am i i would put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">chips on that bed right</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">well that&#39;s what i think and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection there with</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">uh you know the ending of the bretton</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">woods system you know with this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">getting us off the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">link to gold that nixon did that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">this for sure there&#39;s this rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">in this uh you know central bank managed</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">economy that&#39;s going to become the new</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">uh you know experiment that will take</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">worldwide and i think that has some</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">correlation to the stagnation and real</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">wage growth and so on that has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">seemingly a kind of sticking point for</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">for our culture where</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to start to point fingers</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">at each other we&#39;re dividing based on</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">gender</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">and race and so forth and this notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">that if you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">markets can&#39;t really function if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">don&#39;t allow them to truly</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">expand and grow and when they become</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">uh a zombie market that&#39;s propped up by</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">central bank and financial institutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">that are just</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">kind of creating this consumer uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">consumption based economy rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">i guess atomistic creation like we used</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have this moment where</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">we feel rich and we feel decadent but</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">there is a real shrinking pie at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">real tangible</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">you know point of of living you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a real</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot that we could do in</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">that zone you can go all kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">um so yeah inside</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot there um you</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">can think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">maybe a very deep piece is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">the ungroundedness in general and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">groundness of culture in general</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">one aspect of which is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">ungroundedness of money</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">but the ungroundedness of culture in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">general and um</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">and the the capacity and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">of culture and individual psychology to</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">right when you when you are ungrounded</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">um you know when you have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">to take cocaine and to feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got tiger blood um</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about yeah yeah but i was</p>

<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">working out exactly and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">from a mcluhan perspective the rise of</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">has an interesting correlation like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">know the the nixon</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">financial disconnect and also the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">amount of time that our minds were</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a correlation though there&#39;s two</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">they&#39;re cor they&#39;re they&#39;re correlated</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">right they&#39;re not strictly a causal but</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">they begin to build a fabric</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">of a capacity to become increasingly</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of feedback leaps that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">happen when that can occur</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">you&#39;re mentioning some of the thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">that you have been influenced by</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">pretty self-evident to me that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">you&#39;re somewhat familiar with peter</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">thinking on this because he&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">an expert in development</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">and he&#39;s gone very deep to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">um a way of putting it is something like</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">the memetic desire is a real thing but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">part of a larger complex of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">psychological social cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">evolutionary game theoretic constructs</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">uh and you can&#39;t if you put your thumb</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">on that scale</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">just like you&#39;re putting thumb on any</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">scale you&#39;re gonna end up getting a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">little bit confused if you&#39;re not aware</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">of it you&#39;re also gonna be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">confused</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">so that that&#39;s the way i look at it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">would you say it also has a physics</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">component this the the same process that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">that manifests as mimetic desire as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">you said there&#39;s an evolutionary there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">psychological component to it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">deeper than just the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">the surface of imitation of desires</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">would there be a physical component to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">it too</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">well the the answer to your question is</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve never thought that thought before</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">but when you put it in my mind it feels</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">like a very fun thought to think so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">i&#39;d be very interested in contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">it or chatting about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s something that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">thinking about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">is this idea that if if you do see this</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">symmetry of you know desired and you see</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">you&#39;re right it&#39;s not just in human</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:43.680" style="s2">desire you look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">animals and the symmetries of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.680" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">and mating and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">this little pattern that you see yep it</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">looks like there it may go all the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">down to the subatomic level that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">built-in mechanism that we express and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">we we talk about it as</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">desire uh but it it actually looks</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">a lot more fundamental to me than a word</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">like desire</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">this is real interesting i i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">how much as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">a matter of content if your show kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">the deeply esoteric but we can that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">the rabbit hole i&#39;d dive in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">real quick sure yeah there&#39;s a lot so</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">so one of the ways that i that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">thought about it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">this is i&#39;m basically just applying a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">framework that i&#39;ve used in the past</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">that seems like it might roughly fit</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">um not to over code the the domain where</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">app</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">maybe to get some some directions maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">get some orientation on it</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">is this is a distinction that i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">between what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">what i call the rivalries and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">anti-rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">which maps roughly to atoms and bits</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">as it turns out um which by the way we</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">should be very clear the third term here</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">which you might consider energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">to be a a process or a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">between the two um so atoms bits and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">feels like that&#39;s a pretty solid uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">constellation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">you know the characteristic of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">rivalrous is that is rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">desire competitive desire the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">at the end of the day there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">aspects of the physical universe of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">which physics is largely the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">branch of science that studies that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">universe um that are are</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">at the bottom strictly not uh shareable</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">both in the sense that they are atomic</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">if you have it i don&#39;t have it in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">uh and and and tropic i mean that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">to the degree to which you interact with</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">it in any way you turn</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">the free energy into entropy you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">depleted it permanently in a one-way</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">so there are certain aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">universe the things that are studied by</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">that have those characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">around those aspects you would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">that they would evolve</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">for example a as a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">characteristic of any</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">system that sorry i have to back up</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">another component here which has to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">with the irreducible necessity of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">ability to accumulate an up gradient of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">that particular scarce fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">scarce aspect of reality in order to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">perpetuate dissipative systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">right so we have another thing here</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">which is i think you just channeled</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">there for a second i see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">yeah well that was a terrible say that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">you might think i was i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:29.839" style="s2">think real deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:31.279" style="s2">oh yeah no that&#39;s good uh the way this</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">is actually a secret but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.279" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m pretty much a synesthete and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">don&#39;t actually think in words</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">um and so when i&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">what i&#39;m actually doing is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:47.519" style="s2">hold a particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">i kind of refer to as a geometry but</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.519" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a little bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">you ever seen those puzzles that are a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">3d puzzle that you&#39;re looking at on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">computer screen so it&#39;s 2d</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">right yeah you have to rotate it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">orient it until the 3d system</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">pops and you see the 3d model yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">little bit like that like i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">moving things in some i don&#39;t know some</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">interior space</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">but once it locks then i have to hold it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s not easy to hold but once i</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">hold it then i have to start figuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">how to pull the words out that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">map to the thing but the thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">thing um</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">and that may very well be what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">referred to as channeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">but yeah that was that little bit right</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">there was a nice chunk of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">i&#39;m reasonably confident and um</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">okay so you&#39;ve got that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">dissipative systems and you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">the reality that there&#39;s essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">binary in dissipative systems which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">to say that either they</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">are what de lois would call his cities</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.880" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">you might mean a simple term would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">ephemeral like a uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">a sirocco or a little breeze you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">comes around</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">and it goes away and so it evaporates</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">so you know this by the way i had this</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">uh about 12 years ago we kind of were</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">discussing ethics we got down to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">very bottom which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">okay we can we can make a proposition</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">a habit of thought which is based on a</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">um and then you know so then started</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">getting atoms and the atoms became</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">molecules and didn&#39;t evaporate back into</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.360" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">evaporate back right so that</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">have the survivor&#39;s bias of that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">you know kind of channel a little bit of</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">into that structure you&#39;re like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">and the narratives and mytho poetics and</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">down to the struggle between um</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">from the quantum foam all the way up to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">you know complex cultures i think then</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a very fair frame to actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">start really talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">the gerardian insight but to remember</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">that piece of reality which is the piece</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">studies but then we have to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">the the other side</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">which has to do with um</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">creativity emergence and this is where</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">have still never yet finished i figured</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">out how to figure out our knife fight</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">and brett i think sits in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">middle of it because he at the end of</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">in time some kind of actual novelty like</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">novation exists as a part of ontology</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">well okay that&#39;s the other piece right</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">novation</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">cannot be strictly rivalrous because at</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">the very beginning you&#39;re literally</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">going from zero to one you were in fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">creating moreness</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">that piece is the piece that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">not fully captured in</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">actually creating something new there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">no copy there</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">so that would be the other the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">piece that i would layer in to get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">fully rich</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">uh theory so you&#39;ve got things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">got things like scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">and then this idea of maybe post</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">scarcity here or this idea like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking of the um the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">story of jesus when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">handing out the fishes and loaves and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">takes these fishes and loaves but</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">they just keep coming he doesn&#39;t cut he</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cut the fish up into pieces</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">right everybody get a little out little</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">meat here no he&#39;s just like nope</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s this this declaration of war</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">against scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">right and it doesn&#39;t require it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">require</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">coercion to do he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">all right i&#39;ve i&#39;m forcing you to give</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:21.440" style="s2">me your</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:23.520" style="s2">food he just the voluntary exchange and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.440" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">from that voluntary exchange</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">there&#39;s this renunciation of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">confining</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">power of scarcity right well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">that&#39;s creativity without conflict right</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:34.760" style="s2">that&#39;s create that it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">creativity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.760" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">generativity and as you notice there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">whole bunch of characteristics like if</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">you think about that particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">uh parable there&#39;s a a mentality</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a premise there&#39;s a commitment</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">to peace</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.039" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">for example you can&#39;t in fact have</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">generativity outside of peace</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">peace is the space which gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">the possibility of true collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">once you&#39;ve achieved peace you then have</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">achieved this capacity to shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">from a scarcity dynamic to an abundance</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">i think of i think of there being a uh a</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a choice and a big part of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">choice has to do with fear</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">in the face of fear because at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">moment they&#39;ll say hey</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">who&#39;s going to get the scarce fish</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">and loads and maybe if i&#39;m if i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">find a way to get past that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">as the basis of choice and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">this is a very nuanced thing i&#39;m saying</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">deeper than that is that sense of well</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">this particular parable would be love</p>

<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">begin to recognize that oh oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">if we voluntarily associate in this</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">we can in fact get past this problem</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">around about 1945 we found ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">a very uncomfortable situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">where we got right up to the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">and had this thing looking back at us</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">called mutually assured destruction</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">we had to start figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">shift the boundary conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">how we exercise that that impulse the</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">um i think there&#39;s a finding that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">powerful like it&#39;s that that&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">in a sense right i think i&#39;ve said this</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">on a previous conversation i think with</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">jack murphy which</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">for was 000 years we had a story where</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">we were invited to live in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">for the past 100 years we&#39;ve had a story</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">where we actually we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve got no choice and every day the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">how would i call it the pit gets wider</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">and deeper and closer to our toes</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">in 1945 just well it&#39;s making 1962</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">jess khrushchev and kennedy could have</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">plunged the world into nuclear abyss</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">just two guys and all they had to do is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">not push the button</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">but every day in every way we just get</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">better and better at killing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">which means we got to get better and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">better at not killing everybody and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">that that age-old 13.5 billion year</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:21.279" style="s2">habit</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">of when push comes to shove pushing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.279" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">shoving we have to actually figure out</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">how to not do that we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">learn how to anchor ourselves in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">space of peace</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">to consistently and always as as</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">individuals and as a collective to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">that choice to freely associate</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2">um and it&#39;s right there it&#39;s just i feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">like we</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">we sort of if we if we step back and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">just sort of look at it we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">that we&#39;re currently right now living in</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">two worlds simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">you can feel the energy of the of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">conflict yeah the scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">that any moment wants to just tear apart</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">the whole story pardon me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">on the other hand the other side</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">salvation</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">well that&#39;s the question that i was you</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">know because the ambiguous part that i</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">was alluding to is the idea that well</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:12.880" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">scarcity tends to be the occasion for</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.880" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">the impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">find a scapegoat to resolve the tension</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">if there&#39;s a famine</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">if there&#39;s a plague if there&#39;s lack of</p>

<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">if there&#39;s a murder spree whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">something creates scarcity scarcity of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">life scarcity of food scarcity of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">existence scarcity of</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">and that triggers this hunt for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">scapegoat so we&#39;re still trying that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">today but my question is that some</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">people would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s a quote i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s dostoevsky or someone that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">says basically that</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">because i&#39;m always on the hunt for</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">let&#39;s find energy too cheap to meter</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">do to alleviate the social pressures</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">to attack everybody based on collective</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">right so to be the basis of your choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">is fundamentally anchored in fear</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">and you try to solve that by endeavoring</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">to extinguish scarcity in the outside</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">and you you create um</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">a cornucopia of of muchness</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">and you and you&#39;ve actually not solved</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">you haven&#39;t stepped it product in many</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">ways you actually get more fearful in in</p>

<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">um and there&#39;s another way right the the</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">is to sort of recognize that the only</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">the only real bit that flips the only</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">is at that basis of choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">how much are you are you able to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">the basis of choice the thing that is at</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">the bottom of how it is you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">into the choices you&#39;re making how much</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.599" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">are you able to achieve coming into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">place from the space of of love or peace</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">or grace whatever term you&#39;d like to use</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">all part of the same complex that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">really be named or fear</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">or sin right that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">because you know and we have plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">stories of people who&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">make that shift</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">if you come from that place of love and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">you perceive a possibility of material</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">scarcity real scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">the way you relate to that real scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">is just completely different</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">contrary wise if you come from a place</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">of fear and you&#39;re sitting in a world of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">absolute plenitude you&#39;re still an</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">asshole</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t help it greed will still drive</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">a lot of your choice making</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">so the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">deeply can you ground yourself in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">other place</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean for the least bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get rid of the aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">reality that is bounded by</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s still a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">characteristic of reality what it means</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">is that your choice making</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">will not be dominated by that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">characteristic of reality</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">location and it will be</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">and fishes right as a parable</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">your choice making will always be saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">let us think more</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">deeply let us consider more fully how it</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">is we may find a way to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">abundance in this space if we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.839" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">maintain the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">to not be at each other&#39;s throats now</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">we&#39;re 13.6 billion years into this game</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a lot of instincts that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">oriented towards scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">um it&#39;ll probably be another 13.6</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">billion years before we can be so fully</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">anchored in the other side of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">equation that we can feel like it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">forever all all the time but</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a sort of a 50 50.</p>

<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">you know and the pyramid maintains right</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:10.880" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s a it&#39;s a structure</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">staves off profane violence right the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">first one is fear of profane violence</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">maintains a a tacit agreement to stay in</p>

<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">and a big piece of the profane</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">is to simulate and also to parasitize</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">the sacred</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">uh some folks will say you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">right even</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">you know liberalism or libertarianism is</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">the failure of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">this idea of individual rights or my</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">and uh autonomous individuals and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">think to myself wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:43.599" style="s2">libertarians don&#39;t have any power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">not their fault but what they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.599" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">getting at is that is this this weird</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">relationship between a culture&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">uh individualism and the rise of tyranny</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">if you have this individualist mindset</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">somehow we get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">collectivists and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:03.599" style="s2">expansive in our government right it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.599" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">well it i kind of i think it goes like</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.520" end="00:44:10.960" style="s2">this i think it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">two or three step process uh you feel a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">wrongness in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:16.319" style="s2">right and it&#39;s and it&#39;s and it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">a felt sense right first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.319" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a false sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">second you can&#39;t fix it</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">you yourself and by you i mean yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">the real and the relationships that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">can count on</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to be able to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">now what do you do typically what we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">is we escape</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">one place you can get to is you can you</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">can deny the problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:44.400" style="s2">you can make up a story that points the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:47.200" style="s2">blame at something</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">and renders you virtuous and those are</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">the two moves right the first move is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">you find something which is vice</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">you point the blame at something the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">second thing is you render yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:59.400" style="s2">some volks escape into libertarianism</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">they point the point the blame at</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.400" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">authoritarianism or at</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">collectivism anything ends in ism and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">renders themselves virtuous the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">you know individual some folks escape</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">into uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">social justice they point the blame it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">fill in the blank</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">and always render themselves virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the third move</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">right the first move is there is a felt</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">wrongness</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">second move is you feel powerless the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">third move is you escape</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">now the problem is if you&#39;re sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">that third move and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">figure out how to solve things from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">third position</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">you&#39;re going to reinforce the second</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">position because the third position</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">can&#39;t solve anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">it only makes things worse and the worst</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">part is it makes things worse in a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">that actually creates</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">simple categories for other people to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">start dividing and conquering</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">oh i&#39;m a libertarian and the social</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">justice folks are clearly collectivists</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just collectivists in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">principle it&#39;s collectivists in practice</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">by the way they don&#39;t like me they</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">certainly they yell at me a lot they</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">point the finger they seem really mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">and angry and sometimes they even punch</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">so now i&#39;ve got to read out reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">that&#39;s now that&#39;s the fourth move</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a reality that is in fact really</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">real which increases the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">wrongness but it&#39;s actually tied to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">third</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">which was never real in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">which is tied to the second which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">real real and all the way to the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">right so this you get real lost you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">confused and this is what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">you can see it like surging through</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">social media you just sort of step back</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:19.480" style="s2">and watch social media that lens</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">you keep seeing people who are</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.480" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">powerless fundamentally feel powerless</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">so they keep making up stories to try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">feel somewhat digentic</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">and then they mistake their stories for</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">reality and become actually powerless</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s the site again it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a stagnant universe at</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">least you feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">and you can&#39;t grow the pie the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">thing you have to do is to turn to your</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">neighbor and say well it&#39;s the choices</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s your race it&#39;s your gender it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">your ideology</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">which is causing the suffering in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">world you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">need to be quarantined with all guilt</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">quarantined onto you</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">you need to quarantine all guilt onto</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">you and cut it off</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the skateboard mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">it&#39;s still trying to happen it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">you know this put it in other places</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">right you could put it in this into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">stone on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">right i i think everybody&#39;s had that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">experience as a child and stubbing your</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">toe on a stone</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">and blaming the stone first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:21.920" style="s2">let me think about that&#39;s a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">simple simple example i don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.920" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">too high pollutant</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">right um i&#39;m walking along and i stub my</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">toe in a stone what happens when i feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">pain and and the consequence the cause</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">is in the past</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">can&#39;t change it i&#39;m in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.760" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">powerless so i feel uncomfortable and</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:47.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s in the past</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">so one of the things i might do is i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">might blame something i can blame myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">that&#39;s uncomfortable i could also blame</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a real insight i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a crucial land though right because</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s too easy</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t help it right you kick the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">stone um</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot of instinct that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">says well maybe what i should do is kick</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">you you stumble on stone maybe maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">should just kick the stone maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">stone got in the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">um and it&#39;s even harder because you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">to realize is that the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">have to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">is you have to recognize that the pain</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">probably pulled you out of your</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">connection to the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">right you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">been pulled back into the profane</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">and if you can build a a capacity now</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">very simple again i stuff my toe my toe</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">hurts</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">the capacity to actually first and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">foremost recognize what it feels like to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">be pulled into the profane</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">and to slow down take a breath</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">look at your toe is it pain or is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">harm</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">if it&#39;s harm is it harm or is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">real damage</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">you know do i actually deal with</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">something if i do let&#39;s deal with</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">if it&#39;s just pain are there any things</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">that i could have done better</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">that i can use to change my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">move forward in the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">if no then it&#39;s in the past it is simply</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:49:59.440" style="s2">a part of reality that happens to occur</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">if yes then let&#39;s grow in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.440" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">as challenging as that may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">which having a two-year-old at home you</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">see that two-year-olds don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">too much of a trouble with it</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">and they stumble and fall they cry</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">because that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">they allow the crime to pass through</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">without getting too hung up on blaming</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">then they figure out how to get better</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">and you know you just be</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">be like unto the child and learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">learn from your mistakes without blaming</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a pretty good ancillary to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">that particular rule yeah the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">god is like children that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the idea to be to be a child</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">to have that child-like lack of desire</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">scapegoat and tear down something else</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s a picture</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">of what we&#39;re trying to describe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because and i want to name it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:53.760" style="s2">we&#39;re having a conversation which has a</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">feeling of feeling a bit it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.760" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s uh what&#39;s living in the in</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">the domain of language and and yet you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">know i&#39;m sitting in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">my chair using a computer to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:07.920" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">telecommunications infrastructure and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.920" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">you&#39;re a makeshift version of a boot</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">because we&#39;re quarantined right</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">quarantine at least on my part i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s always voluntary and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">that&#39;s important to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">but things are things are afoot</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">normality is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">not going on outside i think i was it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">yesterday where the pentagon had that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">whole aliens thing and everybody looks</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">like and goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s going to take a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">than aliens to weird us out these days</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">um so i&#39;d like to invite people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">accept the the reality of the signs</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">that the reality that you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:49.760" style="s2">look around and go oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">this is that thing this is the telling</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">us that we&#39;re right now in the process</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">of making a real big choice</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">whether we spiral down into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">inevitable spiral of memetic desire into</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">conflict into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">into terror or we take this</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">this this stumbling block and we stumble</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">and we acknowledge oh that&#39;s right i</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:09.440" style="s2">have to remember the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">the sacred and the profane</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.440" end="00:52:13.280" style="s2">and i have to to return back to the path</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:15.040" style="s2">before i do anything else and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:16.800" style="s2">proceed forward in this space</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">more deeply in the sacred than i was</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.800" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">before and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">find all those who would be friends you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">know in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">in the uh quaker sense right the society</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">of friends the society of those who</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">agree to support each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">in maintaining their individual and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">collective integrity in the shared space</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">of peace and grace in the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">and then build from there right because</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">that group that group of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">you know a group of people um who enter</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">into an agreement around that kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">um but there&#39;s a jesus there that offers</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s jesus barabbas</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">and pilate says which guy do you want to</p>

<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">and the crowd chooses the jesus who</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2">tried to overthrow things like william</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">wallace did</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">and they chose to kill and butcher the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">jesus who said</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">uh oh jerusalem oh jerusalem if you had</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">only known the ways of peace</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">but they&#39;ve been hidden from your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">now i think here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">thing i think the one danger and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">told this to jordan peterson in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">interview with him is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">we cannot keep the story of jesus in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">domain of the mythic poetic</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">and i think if we don&#39;t see that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">we will miss how different it is from</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">the dying and rising savior myths of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">our mythological past ah nice does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">so if you if you don&#39;t if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">jesus as just um</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:44.079" style="s2">learning abstract ideas like uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">oh uh clean up my room okay that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.079" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t actually see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">tangible human person</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">you can actually imitate a real</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">historical person</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have any basis i think to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">actually try to do this contagious</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">positive mimesis of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">you need a concrete real human person to</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">imitate</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">and so what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;re so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">so christian we don&#39;t realize it that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">the uh the the the concrete reality</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:23.359" style="s2">of how the story of jesus&#39;s life has</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">transformed the world we&#39;re so christian</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.359" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">that we feel the need to defer</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">to those other religions oh you know i</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">you know remember what he said if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:33.680" style="s2">the greatest among you you&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">a servant so we we have that servant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.680" end="00:56:38.880" style="s2">posture for all other</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">uh religious ideas they&#39;re all one</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.880" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">mythological group you see what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">we get that idea because of how</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">thoroughly christian</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">we are does that make sense we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve turned this into one mythological</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">but we we make that mistake for a few</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">reasons one because we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">christianized than we want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">recognize we&#39;re more uh</p>

<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">as that that&#39;s what jesus yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">just to hold you&#39;re right it&#39;s profane</p>

<p begin="01:01:25.280" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">because that the whole story with</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">pontius pilate it&#39;s better that one man</p>

<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:33.040" style="s2">than the whole nation perish that&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">statement not excuse me that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.040" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">pontius that&#39;s caiaphas caiaphas says</p>

<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">and so the story that&#39;s your that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not better that one man died for</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.599" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">the whole nation that the whole nation</p>

<p begin="01:03:10.319" end="01:03:13.520" style="s2">so that we can actually live on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.839" end="01:03:15.839" style="s2">other side of that transition the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.520" end="01:03:16.319" style="s2">side of the eye of the needle right but</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.839" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.319" end="01:03:24.319" style="s2">simba it&#39;s not luke skywalker</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:32.640" style="s2">completely pagan pagan myths because it</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.200" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">always resolves with</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.640" end="01:03:36.160" style="s2">the murder of the enemy with jesus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.160" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t like to tell that story</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting too</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">wow so let&#39;s try this on for size i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">not sure if this is right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">it just popped into my head um i&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:53.520" style="s2">and part of that conversation has been</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">about the um</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.520" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">the salience of the dramatic story</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:04:00.880" style="s2">you know the story of of luke skywalker</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">killing the the bad guy and becoming the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:05.280" style="s2">new noble king</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">sells people like that&#39;s a sexy story</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.280" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">um oh wow how&#39;s that work</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">and technically he doesn&#39;t kill the bad</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">guy to be fair his father</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.119" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">kills the bad guy he actually redeems he</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">redeems</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">his father who kills the bad guy but</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">nonetheless but there&#39;s still a killing</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:24.079" style="s2">there&#39;s still a sacrifice there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">a witch that had to be burned and that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.079" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">was emperor</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">what jesus does is jesus says look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.240" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">emperor palpatine he needs to be loved</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">he needs to be brought into the camp</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">emperor palpatine only looks like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">because he has leprosy and he had a bad</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">childhood</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:40.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what jesus does nobody watches</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:43.359" style="s2">that movie</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">nobody watches that movie that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.359" end="01:04:47.440" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:48.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked a lot well it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.440" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked a lot with the people who i</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.799" end="01:04:51.760" style="s2">talk with very closely</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve even said this out</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.760" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">loud but this one of the things that my</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:57.599" style="s2">has definitely told me many times is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">that we we need to move into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.599" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">post-narrative</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">world which is merely to say a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">post-drama world</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">you know a world where we acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">the reality that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">peace may not be as uh salient</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:16.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not as potent a drug as drama</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.640" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s the simplest thing you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.079" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">if you take a look at i remember</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">watching teenagers talk about this in</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">the context of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:24.079" style="s2">of television when cell phones started</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:27.599" style="s2">showing up</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.079" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">and you know the classic uh drama in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.599" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">in a social interpersonal drama</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:36.319" style="s2">is the drama of confusion person a</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">thinks person b did</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.319" end="01:05:41.039" style="s2">or thinks x and so they go off into some</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">kind of dramatic conflict</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:44.319" style="s2">and of course the teenagers are going</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">why don&#39;t you just call them well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.319" end="01:05:47.359" style="s2">just act like mature grown-ups and just</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">have a conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.359" end="01:05:50.400" style="s2">the miscommunication maybe the hurt</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:51.760" style="s2">feelings or the fear</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.400" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">that you have about what&#39;s going on if</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.760" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">you can actually maturity</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">dissolves drama and it&#39;s interesting how</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">addicted we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:02.079" style="s2">to drama because drama sells drama is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">story that likes to be told drama is</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.079" end="01:06:07.359" style="s2">repeated we gossip drama</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">we very rarely gossip um healthy</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.359" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">stories of of maturity um</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">solving problems in a simple and rich</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:16.400" style="s2">and sustainable way so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:17.200" style="s2">addiction we&#39;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.400" end="01:06:19.039" style="s2">how to shake</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.200" end="01:06:21.920" style="s2">well that&#39;s why that&#39;s why even the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:24.000" style="s2">church has reinserted pagan elements of</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.920" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">god&#39;s character back into its own story</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.000" end="01:06:29.200" style="s2">because it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to sell a god that has</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.200" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">no scarcity in his love he has</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:35.200" style="s2">unconditional love that doesn&#39;t sell for</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.839" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">human beings</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.200" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">we like gods that are made in our image</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">that give tit for tat that give push</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">pull that give</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.440" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">what we call seduction i love you but i</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">might kill you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:48.960" style="s2">i love you but i might blow your whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">village up well</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.960" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not competing for a bargain right</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:54.319" style="s2">we&#39;re like a guy who cuts deals</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:57.680" style="s2">and what jesus says is he&#39;s forgiving</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.319" end="01:06:59.920" style="s2">his enemies while they&#39;re murdering him</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.680" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t say i&#39;ll forgive them if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.920" end="01:07:04.559" style="s2">if you uh if they get me off this cross</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">yeah okay so this is good here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.559" end="01:07:07.200" style="s2">a shift and i think this</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:10.079" style="s2">tried this shift because i&#39;ve struggled</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">with this a lot and i think i&#39;ve found a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.079" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">comfort with it which is um at least i</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:16.720" style="s2">can do this right ah okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">so remember that that structure i gave</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.720" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:21.760" style="s2">first wrongness all around down to</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.359" style="s2">fourth okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.760" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">now if you&#39;re sitting there in the pits</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.359" end="01:07:25.839" style="s2">of fourth and somebody comes to you and</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">says the phrase</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.839" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">unconditional love quite often the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:34.880" style="s2">that you imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:37.839" style="s2">is kind of like unlimited money</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.880" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">you think of it as oh i can do anything</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.839" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">and still have</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.039" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">approval something like that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.280" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">actually know what love even vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:45.599" style="s2">means and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">unconditional love you haven&#39;t got a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.599" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">clue what it actually means</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">now if you think about it in the context</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">of just good parenting so every parent</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.680" end="01:07:55.039" style="s2">should give their child unconditional</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">love i&#39;m going to say that absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.039" end="01:07:57.520" style="s2">categorically</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:07:59.359" style="s2">right there if there&#39;s anything in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.520" end="01:08:00.319" style="s2">world that i believe with experience it</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.359" end="01:08:02.000" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.319" end="01:08:03.520" style="s2">now that does not mean that every parent</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.000" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">should indulge their child by giving</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.520" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">them their</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.079" style="s2">uh approval certainly doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">every parent should give their child</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.079" end="01:08:10.720" style="s2">unconditional candy</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">right right candy and love are not the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.720" end="01:08:14.960" style="s2">same thing right there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:17.279" style="s2">boundaries right unconditional love is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.960" end="01:08:20.239" style="s2">crucible more than it is anything else</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.279" end="01:08:21.520" style="s2">right unconditional love is that i make</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.239" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">a commitment</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.520" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">to so fully love you that i</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">seek in all ways through that love to</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">support you</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.120" end="01:08:56.560" style="s2">if i see a man on the street i actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:58.799" style="s2">remember this and i&#39;ll um</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.560" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">sort of out myself a little bit i was in</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.799" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">i was in an ayahuasca ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:05.199" style="s2">and um the the question the in crew that</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:08.159" style="s2">i put to myself was the question of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.199" end="01:09:10.319" style="s2">is what is mine to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.159" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">and as it turns out in in the ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">there was a young man</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:16.159" style="s2">probably in his early 20s who had been</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:17.679" style="s2">able to get his father</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.159" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">his grandmother and his aunt but not his</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">mother i don&#39;t know what happened there</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">to join them and they were they were</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">definitely not the kind of folks you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:26.480" style="s2">expect to be in this kind of a scenario</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">and dad was sitting next to me and dad</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">had a very tough time</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:32.080" style="s2">my dad was undergoing some serious</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">suffering probably under and</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.080" end="01:09:34.400" style="s2">i think he may have been a vietnam</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.359" end="01:09:35.440" style="s2">veteran so he&#39;s going to some</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.400" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">world-class</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.440" end="01:09:39.600" style="s2">suffering and part of me wanted to reach</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">out to him</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.600" end="01:09:42.799" style="s2">and i was feeling his suffering and i</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">was feeling a oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.799" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">and then all of a sudden it just came</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">clear to me of oh this is my lesson</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:49.600" style="s2">my lesson is to actually love him</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">unconditionally which does not mean to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.600" end="01:09:53.520" style="s2">carry his cross for him</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:55.120" style="s2">quite the opposite is to actually figure</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.520" end="01:09:56.159" style="s2">out with as much discernment as i can</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.120" end="01:09:59.199" style="s2">muster which may</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.159" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">not be much right now um</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.199" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">precisely what his mind to do in</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">relationship to him and precisely what</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:06.239" style="s2">it is to do in relationship to himself</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:07.760" style="s2">and there are that&#39;s parenting again</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.239" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">right parenting as a child</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.760" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">now your job as a parent is not to lift</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:12.320" style="s2">your child&#39;s burden and your</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">job is not to put on your child of</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.320" end="01:10:16.159" style="s2">burdens nonsense to carry</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">is to support them in growing in their</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.159" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">own capacity to discover for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">to build in themselves in increasing</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">capacity to notice</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:25.760" style="s2">what is theirs to do and how to actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:27.600" style="s2">hold the cross that is theirs to hold</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:29.120" style="s2">for the whole and for themselves to grow</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.600" end="01:10:31.679" style="s2">into who it is there they become</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.120" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">it is an infinitely challenging task and</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.679" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">you will always get it wrong</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">that is it though that&#39;s the whole story</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:37.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the beginning of the end and i</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">would just call that friendship by the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.360" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">way once you recognize that every</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:42.080" style="s2">relationship is that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">and every relationship where you either</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.080" end="01:10:46.239" style="s2">try to lift or to impose a burden into</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:48.239" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:49.360" style="s2">is a sin is an error of the of the most</p>

<p begin="01:10:49.360" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">and that your own your own journey is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">journey that gives you more capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">how to under how to discern that then i</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">just start to get to deep</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">well that&#39;s what peter was trying to do</p>

<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">which is to the burden of witnessing me</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">on the cross</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">right right he&#39;s mindful the fact you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:24.960" style="s2">actually trying to avoid your own cross</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">by by pretending to carry mine right</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.960" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not until</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not until they reportedly see a</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:31.840" style="s2">resurrection</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:33.679" style="s2">with jesus that they actually understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">what he was doing all along</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:37.600" style="s2">up until that point they were bound up</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">in the crowd too</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.600" end="01:11:40.800" style="s2">and abandoned him in his moment of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:43.199" style="s2">persecution</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.800" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until they saw the empty tomb</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.199" end="01:11:47.360" style="s2">and physically went to their deaths</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:49.520" style="s2">and it was also interesting that they</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.360" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">used you know women were reported to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.520" end="01:11:52.400" style="s2">the first witnesses so if they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:54.159" style="s2">make up a myth</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.400" end="01:11:56.239" style="s2">why would you put women at the time when</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.159" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">they would be considered not even worth</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.239" end="01:11:59.360" style="s2">uh any kind of credible testimony in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:00.480" style="s2">court of law</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.360" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">so if they&#39;re trying to make if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.480" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">trying to sell you on a lie</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t put women as the first uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:08.960" style="s2">witnesses to the resurrected christ they</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:10.239" style="s2">would they would</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.960" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">because they know that would be worth</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.239" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">like a child or</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">in terms of court testimony so they see</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">something they really truly believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:21.760" style="s2">and it transforms everything that they</p>

<p begin="01:12:21.760" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">all their embarrassing moments in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.120" style="s2">gospels that they miss it</p>

<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:06.719" style="s2">bit has the disadvantage</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.520" end="01:16:09.600" style="s2">of missing the whole point um</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.719" end="01:16:10.719" style="s2">which is neither here nor there i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:12.480" style="s2">certainly haven&#39;t done a particularly</p>

<p begin="01:16:13.760" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">to the degree to which the church has</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">been able to do anything at all for</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:21.120" style="s2">thousands of years</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:25.199" style="s2">that&#39;s miraculous in and of itself but</p>

<p begin="01:16:31.679" end="01:16:35.199" style="s2">gonna have to actually figure this have</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:36.719" style="s2">to figure this out for real</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:38.480" style="s2">um you know if it&#39;s not in this</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.719" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">particular crisis and i&#39;ve called it a</p>

<p begin="01:17:07.920" end="01:17:11.199" style="s2">you know something along those lines and</p>

<p begin="01:17:11.199" end="01:17:14.880" style="s2">and i don&#39;t mean that in terms of</p>

<p begin="01:17:57.280" end="01:18:02.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m saying we&#39;re coming pretty close</p>

<p begin="01:18:06.400" end="01:18:09.120" style="s2">i&#39;m not in the least bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:11.120" style="s2">kidding when i when i say what i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:18:49.679" end="01:18:53.440" style="s2">and then once we begin to think about</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.159" end="01:18:55.199" style="s2">that and it&#39;s scary</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.440" end="01:18:57.199" style="s2">because this is where you&#39;ll realize how</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.199" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">much social pressure</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.199" end="01:19:01.040" style="s2">is actually built into what we call</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:03.280" style="s2">knowledge in science</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.040" end="01:19:05.120" style="s2">and that the sooner we start to have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.280" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">courage to speak out about these things</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.120" end="01:19:09.120" style="s2">and think</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:10.719" style="s2">critically about what is nature and i</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.120" end="01:19:11.360" style="s2">would say you know people dismiss the</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.719" end="01:19:13.199" style="s2">idea and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.360" end="01:19:15.280" style="s2">i&#39;m just using this as an example they</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.199" end="01:19:16.000" style="s2">dismiss the idea of course jesus is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.280" end="01:19:18.239" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.000" end="01:19:20.239" style="s2">and i would say yes the most important</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.239" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">thing is to imitate the character of</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.239" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">jesus</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:26.800" style="s2">uh and not quibble about some of the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:29.199" style="s2">fights about dogma but i would also say</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.800" end="01:19:30.400" style="s2">that um you know people would say you</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.199" end="01:19:31.679" style="s2">know that of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.400" end="01:19:33.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as a physical</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.679" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">resurrection that defies nature and i</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.440" end="01:19:36.400" style="s2">would say well</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.080" end="01:19:38.080" style="s2">how do you know what nature is if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:39.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know what nature is how would you</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.080" end="01:19:42.239" style="s2">know what super nature is</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.760" end="01:19:43.760" style="s2">above nature if you don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.239" end="01:19:46.640" style="s2">real nature really is</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.760" end="01:19:47.920" style="s2">then how can you even begin to give us a</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.640" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">credible</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.920" end="01:19:51.040" style="s2">uh critique of oh no this is outside of</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:53.199" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.040" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">because i know what nature is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.199" end="01:19:55.600" style="s2">outside of nature therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:19:58.080" style="s2">supernatural</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.600" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a myth it&#39;s fake never happened now</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.080" end="01:20:00.239" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:02.719" style="s2">that one of the things that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.239" end="01:20:06.480" style="s2">help us break through to the other side</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">is as a species is to recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.480" end="01:20:12.000" style="s2">our our settled science for so many</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">things including things as simple as the</p>

<p begin="01:20:16.560" end="01:20:21.280" style="s2">and we have to have the humility the</p>

<p begin="01:20:21.280" end="01:20:25.920" style="s2">and the courage most importantly because</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.679" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">we&#39;re afraid to say</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.920" end="01:20:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;re afraid to call out icons of</p>

<p begin="01:20:36.320" end="01:20:39.280" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want to be socially</p>

<p begin="01:20:54.400" end="01:20:58.000" style="s2">gave us a little clue</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.920" end="01:20:59.600" style="s2">with the idea about faith being the</p>

<p begin="01:21:03.040" end="01:21:06.080" style="s2">but i think if you take gerard and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.800" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">take thomas coon</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.080" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">you might have a better picture at how</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:12.000" style="s2">much we need to re-question things that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:12.880" style="s2">we think are settled science does that</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.000" end="01:21:14.639" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.880" end="01:21:16.320" style="s2">of course i i could not agree more</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.639" end="01:21:18.320" style="s2">strongly i think it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.320" end="01:21:20.480" style="s2">and again i i like the false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.320" end="01:21:21.600" style="s2">put out there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.480" end="01:21:23.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s very similar to the one we were</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.600" end="01:21:24.560" style="s2">talking about earlier like we created</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.120" end="01:21:26.320" style="s2">sort of a false distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.560" end="01:21:27.360" style="s2">authoritarians and libertarians</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.320" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">and that recognized recognizes that</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.360" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">false distinction is what causes both of</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:32.239" style="s2">those to begin to show up they co-create</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">each other and could not exist without</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.239" end="01:21:36.239" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:36.560" style="s2">um same thing happens here right your</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.239" end="01:21:39.600" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.560" end="01:21:42.480" style="s2">sort of scientific authoritarian has to</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.600" end="01:21:44.480" style="s2">categorize critical thinking as</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.480" end="01:21:45.280" style="s2">pseudoscience but that does not mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.480" end="01:21:47.120" style="s2">there isn&#39;t such a thing as</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.280" end="01:21:48.960" style="s2">pseudoscience right of course</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.120" end="01:21:50.480" style="s2">there is magical thinking in this and</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.960" end="01:21:52.320" style="s2">it&#39;s out there too and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.480" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">magical thinking has to</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.320" end="01:22:00.000" style="s2">categorize um</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.400" end="01:22:02.560" style="s2">magical thinking has to identify rigor</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.000" end="01:22:03.679" style="s2">as authoritarian and you get an error</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.560" end="01:22:05.360" style="s2">and you get trapped you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.679" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">be in that place in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.360" end="01:22:09.280" style="s2">where you&#39;re trying to be humble</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.880" end="01:22:10.400" style="s2">humility right neither position has a</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.280" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">lot of humility</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.400" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">both positions very righteous about</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">their rightness</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.000" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">um but if you have a place of humility</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:19.360" style="s2">around reality then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:23.040" style="s2">in a place of being able to say i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.360" end="01:22:25.199" style="s2">alright i mean if if push comes to shove</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.040" end="01:22:26.639" style="s2">and most of the times it doesn&#39;t i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.199" end="01:22:28.480" style="s2">going to assume a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.639" end="01:22:30.480" style="s2">about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.480" end="01:22:32.239" style="s2">um but generally speaking my job is to</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.480" end="01:22:34.560" style="s2">create as much space as possible</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.239" end="01:22:35.920" style="s2">to be as open as possible as reality</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.560" end="01:22:37.280" style="s2">could give me because that&#39;s how you do</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.920" end="01:22:38.400" style="s2">things that&#39;s how you learn new things</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.280" end="01:22:42.080" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.400" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">um so yes and by the way you can also</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.080" end="01:22:45.840" style="s2">work it backwards</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:46.719" style="s2">as it turns out you can actually take a</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.840" end="01:22:50.000" style="s2">look at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.719" end="01:22:51.520" style="s2">scientific revolutions and start to see</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.000" end="01:22:52.480" style="s2">when they occur and how they occur and</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.520" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">what their characteristics and</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.480" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">trajectories look like</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.199" style="s2">and say oh we&#39;re actually kind of due</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:23:00.159" style="s2">for one we&#39;ve been sort of sitting</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.199" end="01:23:01.199" style="s2">sitting spinning in a an increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.159" end="01:23:04.480" style="s2">landlocked</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.199" end="01:23:07.120" style="s2">uh um miasma</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.480" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">of stuff not moving around for a while</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.120" end="01:23:12.400" style="s2">and this is usually a sign</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">that a break is about to occur</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.400" end="01:23:15.520" style="s2">so what does that mean well it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.080" end="01:23:16.960" style="s2">know it&#39;s very hard to know</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.520" end="01:23:18.080" style="s2">i certainly agree with nietzsche&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.960" end="01:23:19.440" style="s2">that we do not yet know what the body</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.080" end="01:23:20.560" style="s2">can do which is just another way of</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.440" end="01:23:24.000" style="s2">saying let us be</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.560" end="01:23:24.000" style="s2">humble in the face of what is real</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.440" end="01:23:31.120" style="s2">how can you um</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.040" end="01:23:32.719" style="s2">advance the world of atoms if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.120" end="01:23:34.400" style="s2">really know what an atom really is</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.719" end="01:23:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the way i think about it that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.400" end="01:23:38.880" style="s2">definitely slow you down won&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.880" end="01:23:40.800" style="s2">but but to have but to have the courage</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.880" end="01:23:42.239" style="s2">to even speak about it publicly i mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.800" end="01:23:45.840" style="s2">even the most radical</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.239" end="01:23:48.880" style="s2">innovative brands that we can think of</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.840" end="01:23:49.760" style="s2">we&#39;re still trained we don&#39;t realize how</p>

<p begin="01:24:22.159" end="01:24:26.719" style="s2">your papers</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:28.719" style="s2">come close to meeting our tree house</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.719" end="01:24:30.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a tree house you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.719" end="01:24:31.280" style="s2">you&#39;re not in the tree house do you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.400" end="01:24:33.360" style="s2">the code</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.280" end="01:24:34.960" style="s2">and so everybody says well i want to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.360" end="01:24:35.520" style="s2">a respectable person i need to make</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.960" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:39.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a career to go i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.760" end="01:24:42.480" style="s2">question anything i&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.440" end="01:24:44.320" style="s2">sit down and shut up and hope</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.480" end="01:24:46.960" style="s2">that somewhere down the road someone</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.320" end="01:24:49.440" style="s2">will have the credentials</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.960" end="01:24:50.239" style="s2">to challenge like martin luther the</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.440" end="01:24:53.440" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.239" end="01:24:54.639" style="s2">of science ah see what i mean it takes</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.440" end="01:24:56.800" style="s2">someone from the inside</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.639" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">usually if you know martin luther was a</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.800" end="01:25:00.320" style="s2">a monks monk</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:01.360" style="s2">and you had to have a monk&#39;s monk come</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.320" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">in there and say hey</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.360" end="01:25:05.040" style="s2">i&#39;m an insider this is all bs a</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">whistleblower well sure enough because i</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.040" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">mean this must be very clear</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:09.600" style="s2">uh physics is a real thing there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">of they can do a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.600" end="01:25:12.639" style="s2">they can make transistors they can make</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:13.360" style="s2">laser beams right you can do real stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.639" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.360" end="01:25:18.239" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of work put into it</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:20.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t understand it deeply enough to</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.239" end="01:25:24.159" style="s2">like exercise a true critique of physics</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.880" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">ptolemaic uh views of the world were</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.159" end="01:25:28.080" style="s2">very good at charting uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:29.360" style="s2">ship courses yep there&#39;s there&#39;s and if</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.080" end="01:25:30.239" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know it from the inside well</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.360" end="01:25:31.760" style="s2">enough you were going to have real</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.239" end="01:25:32.880" style="s2">trouble so you need one of two things</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.760" end="01:25:34.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.880" end="01:25:35.920" style="s2">you either need somebody who&#39;s on you</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.400" end="01:25:37.440" style="s2">need martin luther</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:39.280" style="s2">to come and say hey guys i needed to</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.440" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">sort of share with the hoi polloi what</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.280" end="01:25:42.480" style="s2">all of us kind of know which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:44.480" style="s2">the emperor has a lot less clothes than</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.480" end="01:25:46.080" style="s2">emperor likes to pretend</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.480" end="01:25:47.600" style="s2">um which maybe is the kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.080" end="01:25:50.400" style="s2">eric&#39;s been about</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.600" end="01:25:52.480" style="s2">or you need to actually do something</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.400" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">which is truly powerful and new</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.480" end="01:25:56.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t require you to get permission</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:58.080" style="s2">from the church that&#39;s right that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.320" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.080" end="01:26:02.480" style="s2">has to happen you have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:04.320" style="s2">i know this is going to sound weird but</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.480" end="01:26:05.920" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like the the miracle of</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.320" end="01:26:06.880" style="s2">the fishes and lows you&#39;ve got to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.920" end="01:26:08.960" style="s2">demonstrations</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.880" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">so let me give you let me give you my</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.960" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">mind there so um</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:15.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the way science used to be done</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.159" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">by the way tesla would do a</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.440" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">demonstration in the public you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:19.520" style="s2">have to have like beer he&#39;s like look at</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.719" end="01:26:22.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.520" end="01:26:23.760" style="s2">this is actually imagine if he had to go</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.960" end="01:26:25.360" style="s2">through the peer</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.760" end="01:26:26.800" style="s2">peer journals to get his stuff out</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.360" end="01:26:28.080" style="s2">nothing you know we&#39;d still be using</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.800" end="01:26:29.920" style="s2">what dc current</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.080" end="01:26:31.199" style="s2">fry in our heads check this out i think</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.920" end="01:26:32.719" style="s2">this is going to be great i think</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.199" end="01:26:34.639" style="s2">this is going to be a really nice uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.719" end="01:26:36.560" style="s2">piece particularly for everybody who</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.639" end="01:26:37.760" style="s2">or anybody i don&#39;t know if ever anybody</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.560" end="01:26:39.280" style="s2">ever listens to these things says the</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.760" end="01:26:40.480" style="s2">two of us and as far as i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.280" end="01:26:42.560" style="s2">that&#39;s okay because this has been a good</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.480" end="01:26:46.080" style="s2">conversation from my point of view</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.560" end="01:26:47.440" style="s2">um all right so if i was going to try to</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.080" end="01:26:50.560" style="s2">really chip away</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.440" end="01:26:51.920" style="s2">at this the pseudo-sacred edifice of</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.560" end="01:26:54.400" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.920" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">i definitely wouldn&#39;t go after physics i</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.400" end="01:26:57.199" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t go after biology neither why is</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:26:58.719" style="s2">that the holy of holies</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.199" end="01:27:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the holy of holies and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.719" end="01:27:02.080" style="s2">protected by a lot of veils right i</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.480" end="01:27:03.120" style="s2">don&#39;t understand exactly how to do all</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.080" end="01:27:05.280" style="s2">the stuff there i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.120" end="01:27:07.040" style="s2">you know i i dropped out of high s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.280" end="01:27:07.920" style="s2">you go behind that veil you&#39;ll see a lot</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.040" end="01:27:09.840" style="s2">of mirrors man</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.920" end="01:27:11.120" style="s2">little funny house of mirrors where am i</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.840" end="01:27:13.040" style="s2">looking yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.120" end="01:27:15.120" style="s2">and i can i can like i can i can tell</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.040" end="01:27:17.199" style="s2">when somebody&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.120" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">trying to bamboozle me but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.199" end="01:27:19.280" style="s2">time i&#39;ve you know i&#39;ve spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:22.880" style="s2">time some</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.280" end="01:27:24.560" style="s2">i i i don&#39;t know murray gal man is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.880" end="01:27:26.480" style="s2">guy who created a big piece of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.560" end="01:27:28.880" style="s2">standard model i&#39;ve met murray</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.480" end="01:27:29.840" style="s2">very smart guy and working real hard to</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.880" end="01:27:32.480" style="s2">try to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.840" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m not casting any disper aspersions</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.480" end="01:27:34.560" style="s2">in physics but we can go after the holy</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:36.400" style="s2">holies</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.560" end="01:27:38.560" style="s2">largely because it&#39;s strong right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.400" end="01:27:39.920" style="s2">you know solid edifice and it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.560" end="01:27:40.719" style="s2">real stuff they build nuclear bombs and</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.920" end="01:27:42.800" style="s2">lasers man</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.719" end="01:27:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to impeach i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.800" end="01:27:46.960" style="s2">necessarily go after</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.000" end="01:27:48.880" style="s2">after chemistry or biology i&#39;d go after</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.960" end="01:27:50.800" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.880" end="01:27:52.159" style="s2">because one those don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.800" end="01:27:53.840" style="s2">what the hell they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.159" end="01:27:55.360" style="s2">they&#39;re full of straight up and</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.840" end="01:27:57.440" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.360" end="01:27:59.040" style="s2">two they like to pretend like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.440" end="01:28:00.880" style="s2">doing science right they put on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.040" end="01:28:02.159" style="s2">whole vest the robes of science and they</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.880" end="01:28:03.040" style="s2">put on the hats and they carry the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.159" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">scepters and they</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.040" end="01:28:06.480" style="s2">sort of stomp around and say nah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:08.960" style="s2">physicists um</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.480" end="01:28:09.840" style="s2">and therefore control all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.960" end="01:28:13.040" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.840" end="01:28:15.040" style="s2">like the asymmetry physicists</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.040" end="01:28:16.960" style="s2">have pretty solid stuff and create real</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.040" end="01:28:17.760" style="s2">things like laser beams and nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.960" end="01:28:19.840" style="s2">bombs</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.760" end="01:28:20.800" style="s2">um and that don&#39;t actually have that</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.840" end="01:28:22.719" style="s2">much influence</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.800" end="01:28:24.800" style="s2">in how the world works in terms of what</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.719" end="01:28:25.440" style="s2">they say economists they don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.800" end="01:28:28.159" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.440" end="01:28:28.880" style="s2">not really like you know richard feynman</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.159" end="01:28:30.400" style="s2">i would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.880" end="01:28:32.239" style="s2">i think it would be in the background</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.400" end="01:28:34.480" style="s2">though they&#39;re they&#39;re they are so</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.239" end="01:28:36.159" style="s2">rarified that their influence doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.480" end="01:28:37.760" style="s2">have to be manifestly made</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.159" end="01:28:40.000" style="s2">yeah they have a very very deep</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.760" end="01:28:41.679" style="s2">influence around the holy of holies</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.000" end="01:28:43.120" style="s2">i think that&#39;s right yeah i think i i</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.679" end="01:28:44.960" style="s2">have just to hope just to</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.120" end="01:28:47.120" style="s2">just to add to that i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.960" end="01:28:48.400" style="s2">because i call it the mowgli effect the</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.120" end="01:28:50.480" style="s2">jungle book effect</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.400" end="01:28:52.239" style="s2">whoever discovers the fire is the one</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.480" end="01:28:54.719" style="s2">who who&#39;s the king of the jungle</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.239" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">you know and so whoever creates the fire</p>

<p begin="01:29:21.280" end="01:29:25.520" style="s2">personal experience very well</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.199" end="01:29:26.719" style="s2">but economics you sure can right</p>

<p begin="01:29:26.719" end="01:29:30.639" style="s2">the the the science is not even vague</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.440" end="01:29:34.080" style="s2">this science</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.639" end="01:29:35.679" style="s2">the empirical evidence is 150 180</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.080" end="01:29:38.000" style="s2">the opposite direction i remember in</p>

<p begin="01:29:38.000" end="01:29:40.960" style="s2">like paul krugman writing down what he</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.520" end="01:29:42.000" style="s2">said and checking it a few days later</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.960" end="01:29:44.560" style="s2">and saying that was wrong</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.000" end="01:29:46.000" style="s2">completely that was wrong completely all</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.560" end="01:29:47.679" style="s2">right so these guys have a really cool</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.000" end="01:29:49.280" style="s2">habit of saying things out loud that are</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.679" end="01:29:52.960" style="s2">absolutely impeachable</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.280" end="01:29:55.199" style="s2">uh historically empirically um</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.960" end="01:29:56.400" style="s2">and and yet right and yet they are</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.199" end="01:29:59.040" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.400" end="01:30:00.800" style="s2">the temple and they sit next to and play</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.040" end="01:30:02.239" style="s2">play roles with as if they are also</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.800" end="01:30:03.280" style="s2">doing science if i wanted to unravel</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.239" end="01:30:05.360" style="s2">that sweater</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.280" end="01:30:06.880" style="s2">i go right there if you start unraveling</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.360" end="01:30:08.239" style="s2">the sweater lots of things start to</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.880" end="01:30:09.520" style="s2">change and then you&#39;ll find yourself eye</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.239" end="01:30:11.040" style="s2">to eye because remember what holds the</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.520" end="01:30:12.880" style="s2">physicists in charge</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.040" end="01:30:14.560" style="s2">is as you said the end of the day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.880" end="01:30:16.239" style="s2">budgets</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.560" end="01:30:18.480" style="s2">at the end of the day it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.239" end="01:30:19.760" style="s2">ability to say you know young kid who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.480" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">getting a phd</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.760" end="01:30:23.120" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking real interesting</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:25.040" style="s2">thoughts if you&#39;d like to get to</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.120" end="01:30:26.719" style="s2">to be a professor and get paid to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.040" end="01:30:27.199" style="s2">physics probably ought to think slightly</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.719" end="01:30:29.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.199" end="01:30:30.400" style="s2">interesting thoughts right but if they</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.040" end="01:30:31.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that ability if anybody</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.400" end="01:30:32.320" style="s2">could think what they wanted to think</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.520" end="01:30:34.320" style="s2">and not have to</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.320" end="01:30:35.600" style="s2">kowtow to those guys then their power</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.320" end="01:30:37.199" style="s2">would go away really quickly because</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.600" end="01:30:39.120" style="s2">then reality would reestablish itself</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.199" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">well also if the state wasn&#39;t i mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.120" end="01:30:41.520" style="s2">this is another</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:43.679" style="s2">an economic way to look at it if the</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.520" end="01:30:45.040" style="s2">state wasn&#39;t funding science we&#39;d find</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.679" end="01:30:46.320" style="s2">out the truth of the physics and</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.040" end="01:30:47.840" style="s2">chemistry and</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.320" end="01:30:49.679" style="s2">a lot of things a lot faster because</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.840" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">money would have would be allocated</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.679" end="01:30:54.960" style="s2">towards solutions that actually work and</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.840" end="01:30:55.520" style="s2">produce real results that&#39;s why science</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.960" end="01:30:57.280" style="s2">used to</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.520" end="01:30:59.040" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s where i&#39;d go right i&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.280" end="01:31:01.840" style="s2">after i mean where does</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.040" end="01:31:03.440" style="s2">science meet reality at economics</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.840" end="01:31:03.760" style="s2">because economics touches on the market</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.440" end="01:31:05.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.760" end="01:31:07.760" style="s2">so so you&#39;re saying if you were going</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.920" end="01:31:09.360" style="s2">into the temple you&#39;d go after the money</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.760" end="01:31:09.679" style="s2">changers before you opened the veil</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.360" end="01:31:11.199" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.679" end="01:31:12.800" style="s2">i would go after the money changes</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.199" end="01:31:14.639" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what i would do and right</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.800" end="01:31:15.280" style="s2">after he went after the money changers</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.639" end="01:31:16.880" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.280" end="01:31:18.400" style="s2">the veil was ripped and there was no one</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.880" end="01:31:20.159" style="s2">home in the holy of holies you see</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.400" end="01:31:22.320" style="s2">is that right yeah yeah but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.159" end="01:31:24.880" style="s2">stuff he does the money changer thing he</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.320" end="01:31:26.960" style="s2">goes after the economics guys</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.880" end="01:31:28.719" style="s2">that gets him killed and as he&#39;s killed</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.960" end="01:31:30.400" style="s2">it says the veil is torn and there was</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.719" end="01:31:34.159" style="s2">no one home you know oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.400" end="01:31:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody there i i reckon we ought</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.159" end="01:31:37.600" style="s2">to go after the money changers first</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.000" end="01:31:39.760" style="s2">so how do we go after the money changes</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.600" end="01:31:40.239" style="s2">do you have i mean i i&#39;m going to give</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.760" end="01:31:41.840" style="s2">you my</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.239" end="01:31:43.520" style="s2">i like austrian economics do you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.840" end="01:31:45.120" style="s2">like that i&#39;m sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.520" end="01:31:46.719" style="s2">i&#39;m very well i&#39;m very familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.120" end="01:31:48.400" style="s2">austrian economics and i would say by</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.719" end="01:31:49.600" style="s2">and large i feel good about it</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.400" end="01:31:52.000" style="s2">the problem i got with austrian</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.600" end="01:31:53.600" style="s2">economics is that it um</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.000" end="01:31:55.920" style="s2">it uh what do you call it fetishized it</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.600" end="01:31:57.760" style="s2">worships that golden calf</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.920" end="01:31:59.760" style="s2">quite specifically and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.760" end="01:32:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s uh not quite as</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.760" end="01:32:04.639" style="s2">as accurate as it should be but i</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.880" end="01:32:06.000" style="s2">definitely take a solid but wouldn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.639" end="01:32:07.679" style="s2">true austrians just say</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.000" end="01:32:10.719" style="s2">money should be up to the market so if</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.679" end="01:32:12.400" style="s2">they want to use uh wampum or seashells</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.719" end="01:32:14.159" style="s2">they can if they want to use bitcoin</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.400" end="01:32:16.560" style="s2">they can just i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.159" end="01:32:18.239" style="s2">the no true scotsman argument to be fair</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.560" end="01:32:20.239" style="s2">i i do not position myself as being</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.239" end="01:32:21.440" style="s2">among the uh the theology of</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.239" end="01:32:23.280" style="s2">austrian economics i cannot tell you</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.440" end="01:32:24.080" style="s2">what a true austrian would say right</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.280" end="01:32:26.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.080" end="01:32:28.159" style="s2">most of the folks i know who who present</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.880" end="01:32:30.639" style="s2">themselves of that lineage</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.159" end="01:32:32.239" style="s2">they like gold yeah yeah so that so</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.639" end="01:32:35.040" style="s2">you&#39;re saying we need something new</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.239" end="01:32:36.400" style="s2">to to storm the castle of economics or</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.040" end="01:32:38.159" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.400" end="01:32:40.320" style="s2">yeah i think we do what does that look</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.159" end="01:32:41.679" style="s2">like is there something being developed</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.320" end="01:32:43.040" style="s2">in that vein or you&#39;re just saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.679" end="01:32:45.280" style="s2">something we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.040" end="01:32:46.560" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t been done yet um i think a lot</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.280" end="01:32:46.880" style="s2">of things frankly have been developed i</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.560" end="01:32:48.480" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.880" end="01:32:50.960" style="s2">ever since ever since our friends at</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.480" end="01:32:52.800" style="s2">bitcoin cracked open the code of saying</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.960" end="01:32:54.000" style="s2">hey why don&#39;t we think about money</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.800" end="01:32:55.120" style="s2">why don&#39;t we actually just contemplate</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.000" end="01:32:55.840" style="s2">that as a sort of thing that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.120" end="01:32:57.679" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.840" end="01:32:59.520" style="s2">you know prior to bitcoin money was</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.679" end="01:33:01.040" style="s2">either the government</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.520" end="01:33:02.800" style="s2">makes it magical and we kind of don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.040" end="01:33:04.480" style="s2">think about it too hard or</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.800" end="01:33:05.520" style="s2">you know a small group of guys with dust</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.480" end="01:33:06.960" style="s2">on them said no it&#39;s gold and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.520" end="01:33:08.400" style="s2">pretty much it right</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.960" end="01:33:09.520" style="s2">after bitcoin a whole bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.400" end="01:33:10.480" style="s2">are like well i&#39;m just going to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.520" end="01:33:13.760" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.480" end="01:33:15.840" style="s2">my sense is we can hit that</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.760" end="01:33:17.600" style="s2">we can hit money and my guess is that it</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.840" end="01:33:19.120" style="s2">actually ain&#39;t that hard to be honest</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.600" end="01:33:20.480" style="s2">because we can i&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.120" end="01:33:22.320" style="s2">one of the things i actually did a video</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.480" end="01:33:23.360" style="s2">on universal basic income you could take</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.320" end="01:33:25.600" style="s2">a look at it</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.360" end="01:33:26.960" style="s2">i said the way i look at it i think</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.600" end="01:33:28.639" style="s2">about it not from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.960" end="01:33:29.760" style="s2">trying to use the metaphors that have</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.639" end="01:33:30.880" style="s2">been produced by the economics</p>

<p begin="01:33:30.880" end="01:33:32.560" style="s2">out front i think the economic</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.000" end="01:33:35.520" style="s2">profession</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.560" end="01:33:36.960" style="s2">up until maybe like i like the the old</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.520" end="01:33:38.080" style="s2">guys like the real old guys the guys who</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.960" end="01:33:39.679" style="s2">were doing their stuff in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.080" end="01:33:41.679" style="s2">in the 1900s and the early 20th</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.679" end="01:33:43.440" style="s2">centuries i think they were earnestly</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.679" end="01:33:44.639" style="s2">biologists in the botanist sense like</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.440" end="01:33:45.760" style="s2">they&#39;re collecting like natural</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.639" end="01:33:47.840" style="s2">scientists</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s when you get to the the more</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.840" end="01:33:52.320" style="s2">current generations that i get</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.040" end="01:33:54.080" style="s2">real skeptical um</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.320" end="01:33:55.199" style="s2">but i think about it sort of the market</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.080" end="01:33:56.560" style="s2">as supposed to be collective</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.199" end="01:33:57.360" style="s2">intelligence right that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.560" end="01:33:59.360" style="s2">supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.360" end="01:34:01.040" style="s2">the market is a way to have everybody</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.360" end="01:34:04.000" style="s2">benefit from the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.040" end="01:34:05.920" style="s2">and the insight and the intelligence the</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.000" end="01:34:08.400" style="s2">actual capacity to separate</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.920" end="01:34:11.120" style="s2">reality from from illusion of everybody</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.400" end="01:34:13.360" style="s2">else and it&#39;s a tool to do that</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.120" end="01:34:14.960" style="s2">and uh well so the brain is also a form</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.360" end="01:34:15.840" style="s2">of collective intelligence and so is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.960" end="01:34:18.159" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.840" end="01:34:19.920" style="s2">okay cool let&#39;s try to look at neurology</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.159" end="01:34:21.920" style="s2">neuroscience let&#39;s look at graph theory</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.920" end="01:34:23.199" style="s2">network theory and let&#39;s look at markets</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.920" end="01:34:24.560" style="s2">and see if there&#39;s something we can</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.199" end="01:34:26.239" style="s2">learn by taking all three of those</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.560" end="01:34:28.719" style="s2">disciplines and stick them together into</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.239" end="01:34:30.480" style="s2">a single transdisciplinary container</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.719" end="01:34:31.920" style="s2">and my answer is for more or less yes in</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.480" end="01:34:33.600" style="s2">fact we can we can get some really</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.920" end="01:34:35.199" style="s2">really good ideas out of that we can do</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.600" end="01:34:37.120" style="s2">a restructuring of how</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.199" end="01:34:38.480" style="s2">the collective intelligence of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.120" end="01:34:40.080" style="s2">market operates</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.480" end="01:34:42.000" style="s2">to create something which does the thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.080" end="01:34:44.960" style="s2">the market is supposed to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.000" end="01:34:46.560" style="s2">um well like actually do the thing but</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.960" end="01:34:49.199" style="s2">it was promised</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.560" end="01:34:50.639" style="s2">um i just recognized there&#39;s some some</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.199" end="01:34:52.639" style="s2">insights into how</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.639" end="01:34:54.239" style="s2">network topologies like use evolution</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.639" end="01:34:55.600" style="s2">the brain is evolution</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.239" end="01:34:57.280" style="s2">trying to figure out how to get a whole</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.600" end="01:34:58.159" style="s2">bunch of neurons and perceptors and</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.280" end="01:35:00.159" style="s2">actuators</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.159" end="01:35:01.760" style="s2">to coordinate into a highly effective</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.159" end="01:35:03.520" style="s2">decentralized mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.760" end="01:35:04.800" style="s2">okay great let&#39;s do some biomimicry and</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.520" end="01:35:06.960" style="s2">see what does that tell us about how</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.800" end="01:35:08.320" style="s2">markets maybe ought to operate</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.960" end="01:35:09.280" style="s2">um and then of course network theory</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.320" end="01:35:11.199" style="s2">gives us the ability to actually do</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.280" end="01:35:12.719" style="s2">real-time simulations of that same</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.199" end="01:35:14.000" style="s2">underlying set of questions and</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.719" end="01:35:15.520" style="s2">understand a whole bunch of things using</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.000" end="01:35:17.600" style="s2">a variety of actual</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.520" end="01:35:18.960" style="s2">like either a how our networks have</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.600" end="01:35:20.320" style="s2">actually evolved which we can see now</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.960" end="01:35:22.000" style="s2">but it gives us data we can actually see</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.320" end="01:35:22.960" style="s2">it with precision</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.000" end="01:35:25.199" style="s2">and then b we can actually run</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.960" end="01:35:26.560" style="s2">simulations on it so</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.199" end="01:35:28.000" style="s2">those two vectors if you if you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.560" end="01:35:30.800" style="s2">double click on that and say let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.000" end="01:35:34.560" style="s2">rethink these concepts</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.800" end="01:35:36.080" style="s2">not not have a uh not fetishize</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.560" end="01:35:37.920" style="s2">economics in the way that physicists</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.080" end="01:35:38.239" style="s2">have been fetishizing physics let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.920" end="01:35:39.440" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.239" end="01:35:40.719" style="s2">aware of the fact that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.440" end="01:35:41.520" style="s2">things that we may think are true are</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.719" end="01:35:43.440" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.520" end="01:35:44.880" style="s2">not probably in many cases may be less</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.440" end="01:35:47.280" style="s2">true than we think they are</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.880" end="01:35:48.880" style="s2">or we hold them too close and start</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.280" end="01:35:50.080" style="s2">looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.880" end="01:35:51.199" style="s2">i think we can do some really good work</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.080" end="01:35:53.520" style="s2">fast i don&#39;t think it would take us very</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.199" end="01:35:55.119" style="s2">long because</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.520" end="01:35:56.480" style="s2">let me pause on that for a minute one</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.119" end="01:35:58.480" style="s2">more sort of piece of theory that i</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.480" end="01:36:00.000" style="s2">think is pretty important</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.480" end="01:36:02.000" style="s2">because we go back we talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.000" end="01:36:03.119" style="s2">in terms of peter&#39;s proposition peter</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.000" end="01:36:04.639" style="s2">thiel&#39;s proposition</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.119" end="01:36:06.159" style="s2">and my proposition and i think many</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.639" end="01:36:10.239" style="s2">other people that something happened in</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.159" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">the 70s things went awful sideways</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.239" end="01:36:13.440" style="s2">one of the theories to which i ascribe</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.239" end="01:36:16.560" style="s2">meaningfully</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.440" end="01:36:16.560" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.040" end="01:36:20.880" style="s2">a schumpeter i think our french</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.080" end="01:36:22.560" style="s2">trumpeter actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.880" end="01:36:23.920" style="s2">hit the nail on the head pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.560" end="01:36:26.080" style="s2">creative destruction in fact</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.920" end="01:36:29.600" style="s2">specifically s-curves</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.080" end="01:36:31.840" style="s2">and um my sense is that around about the</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.600" end="01:36:32.560" style="s2">mid-70s we were beginning the process at</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.840" end="01:36:35.199" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.560" end="01:36:38.320" style="s2">of that era and that we should have been</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.199" end="01:36:41.679" style="s2">moving into a truly new era</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.320" end="01:36:43.440" style="s2">but unfortunately there were powers that</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.679" end="01:36:45.679" style="s2">be they had the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.440" end="01:36:47.679" style="s2">to prevent that from happening so</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.679" end="01:36:48.400" style="s2">instead of truly moving into an actual</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.679" end="01:36:49.840" style="s2">new era</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.400" end="01:36:51.119" style="s2">in the 80s and 90s which is when we</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.840" end="01:36:52.159" style="s2">should have been in the childhood of</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.119" end="01:36:53.760" style="s2">that era</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.159" end="01:36:55.040" style="s2">we went through the great moderation</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.760" end="01:36:57.600" style="s2">which also ended up as the great</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.040" end="01:37:00.239" style="s2">financialization</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.600" end="01:37:01.600" style="s2">and that constrained we still got some</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.239" end="01:37:02.320" style="s2">stuff out of the new era right we got</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.600" end="01:37:04.400" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.320" end="01:37:06.239" style="s2">but computers ended up being an artifact</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.400" end="01:37:07.440" style="s2">that was independent to the existing</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.239" end="01:37:10.159" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.440" end="01:37:10.800" style="s2">maximally minimum disruption maximum</p>

<p begin="01:37:10.800" end="01:37:14.239" style="s2">and was mostly financialized so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.800" end="01:37:15.920" style="s2">got something like microsoft which is</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.239" end="01:37:17.040" style="s2">this grotesque capture</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.920" end="01:37:20.320" style="s2">of the energy of what should have</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.040" end="01:37:21.760" style="s2">happened and turns most of it into</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.320" end="01:37:23.760" style="s2">most of it into money and most of it</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.760" end="01:37:27.119" style="s2">into minimum disruption</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.760" end="01:37:29.600" style="s2">for example just as as one piece of it</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.119" end="01:37:31.119" style="s2">the reason why i&#39;m bringing that up is</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.600" end="01:37:32.800" style="s2">we should right now be sitting in a</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.119" end="01:37:35.440" style="s2">mature</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.800" end="01:37:35.920" style="s2">next thing right school should have</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.440" end="01:37:37.760" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.920" end="01:37:40.080" style="s2">banking should have changed governance</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.760" end="01:37:41.719" style="s2">should have changed a lot right at least</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.080" end="01:37:44.639" style="s2">as much as what happened between</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.719" end="01:37:46.480" style="s2">1914 and 1945 right that period of</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.639" end="01:37:49.520" style="s2">transition between the victorian era</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.480" end="01:37:50.800" style="s2">and the modern era a lot changed that</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.520" end="01:37:52.560" style="s2">same amount should have changed between</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.800" end="01:37:55.760" style="s2">1972 and say</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.560" end="01:37:57.520" style="s2">1999 somewhere why didn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.760" end="01:38:00.080" style="s2">we could talk about it in detail if we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.520" end="01:38:02.560" style="s2">like but i&#39;m just going to say that</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.080" end="01:38:03.920" style="s2">the capacity of the institutions of</p>

<p begin="01:40:57.360" end="01:40:59.600" style="s2">scapegoats around quite often being</p>

<p begin="01:41:01.679" end="01:41:07.600" style="s2">being broken and destroyed and</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.400" end="01:41:09.440" style="s2">rendered incapable and voiceless but</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.600" end="01:41:12.000" style="s2">a lot of work was done in that period of</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.440" end="01:41:14.560" style="s2">time a lot of work has been done so</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.000" end="01:41:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not so much i think our job is to</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.560" end="01:41:17.520" style="s2">invent from scratch</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.920" end="01:41:19.360" style="s2">i think a lot of our job is to actually</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.520" end="01:41:21.280" style="s2">rediscover and to synthesize and to</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.360" end="01:41:22.800" style="s2">integrate and to redeem</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.280" end="01:41:24.719" style="s2">and to bring back into right</p>

<p begin="01:41:24.719" end="01:41:29.520" style="s2">and to recover that&#39;s just an easier job</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.840" end="01:41:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s very good very good because what</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.520" end="01:41:33.280" style="s2">you&#39;re saying there is very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.800" end="01:41:36.320" style="s2">interesting to me because</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.280" end="01:41:38.159" style="s2">i&#39;m going to use that story of of</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.320" end="01:41:39.520" style="s2">the the christ story again just to kind</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.159" end="01:41:41.040" style="s2">of give you a picture of what i think</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.520" end="01:41:42.880" style="s2">you&#39;re getting at here</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.040" end="01:41:44.800" style="s2">there&#39;s these scapegoats out in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.880" end="01:41:47.600" style="s2">wilderness right</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.800" end="01:41:49.280" style="s2">and they have these knowledge projects</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.600" end="01:41:52.719" style="s2">that they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.280" end="01:41:55.119" style="s2">and our job is to bear witness</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.719" end="01:41:56.080" style="s2">and bring that scapegoat back into</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.119" end="01:42:00.000" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.080" end="01:42:02.400" style="s2">in the same way as this what happened i</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.000" end="01:42:03.840" style="s2">always call the gospels the gospel</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.400" end="01:42:06.080" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.840" end="01:42:07.199" style="s2">because what it is is it&#39;s a piece of</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.080" end="01:42:09.199" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.199" end="01:42:12.480" style="s2">written from the vantage point of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.199" end="01:42:14.560" style="s2">scapegoat rather than the winning crowd</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.480" end="01:42:16.080" style="s2">up into that point all myths had been</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.560" end="01:42:17.840" style="s2">written from the vantage point of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.080" end="01:42:19.840" style="s2">winning crowd</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.840" end="01:42:21.679" style="s2">and to this day we believe in something</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.840" end="01:42:24.400" style="s2">called the edible complex</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.679" end="01:42:25.600" style="s2">that oedipus actually killed his dad and</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.400" end="01:42:27.440" style="s2">had sex with his mother</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.600" end="01:42:29.199" style="s2">we still scapegoat him by our own</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.440" end="01:42:30.320" style="s2">psychological inheritance of our</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.199" end="01:42:33.040" style="s2">modernistic</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.320" end="01:42:34.239" style="s2">uh uh science so so what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.040" end="01:42:35.119" style="s2">all history had been written for the</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.239" end="01:42:36.800" style="s2">winner&#39;s crowd</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.119" end="01:42:38.800" style="s2">and then the gospels are a piece of</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.800" end="01:42:41.280" style="s2">media that say actually no</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.800" end="01:42:41.840" style="s2">if you take the camera and play the same</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.280" end="01:42:43.760" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.840" end="01:42:46.080" style="s2">sequence but give the camera to the</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.760" end="01:42:49.840" style="s2">scapegoat you&#39;ll see a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.080" end="01:42:51.760" style="s2">universe and what i think happens here</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.840" end="01:42:54.719" style="s2">this is why i call the technology is</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.760" end="01:42:56.480" style="s2">if we imitate the gospel writers and</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.719" end="01:42:58.320" style="s2">take the camera of history</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.480" end="01:43:01.280" style="s2">and give it to the scapegoats who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.320" end="01:43:03.119" style="s2">been banished to the hinterlands</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.280" end="01:43:05.440" style="s2">then we&#39;ll see the same sequence of</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.119" end="01:43:06.159" style="s2">events of what is economics what is</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.440" end="01:43:08.560" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.159" end="01:43:10.239" style="s2">what is all this stuff nutrition and</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.560" end="01:43:10.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll see it play out from a different</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.239" end="01:43:13.920" style="s2">angle</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.800" end="01:43:16.239" style="s2">and it will allow people to</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.920" end="01:43:17.520" style="s2">make progress and move ahead as a</p>

<p begin="01:43:17.520" end="01:43:20.719" style="s2">so so this goes back to the wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.600" end="01:43:22.960" style="s2">point which is</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.719" end="01:43:24.560" style="s2">media technology back to mcluhan we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.960" end="01:43:27.600" style="s2">back to mcclure</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.560" end="01:43:30.080" style="s2">media technology is what allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.600" end="01:43:31.520" style="s2">imitate the gospel technology of handing</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.080" end="01:43:34.239" style="s2">the cameras</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.520" end="01:43:36.320" style="s2">to the banished scapegoats who have been</p>

<p begin="01:43:58.639" end="01:44:01.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch here so what i</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.679" end="01:44:03.360" style="s2">would say is that the part of that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.679" end="01:44:06.159" style="s2">done that we&#39;ve done the first part</p>

<p begin="01:44:06.159" end="01:44:09.119" style="s2">we can move the camera</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.679" end="01:44:10.880" style="s2">we have the capacity to move the camera</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.119" end="01:44:11.280" style="s2">which is a big thing and that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.880" end="01:44:12.800" style="s2">did it</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.280" end="01:44:13.600" style="s2">i focused on that so much back in that</p>

<p begin="01:44:34.480" end="01:44:39.520" style="s2">all right the second is we have to</p>

<p begin="01:44:39.920" end="01:44:43.360" style="s2">that may be all actually move the camera</p>

<p begin="01:45:45.840" end="01:45:48.239" style="s2">because fake news and mythology are the</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.600" end="01:45:49.920" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.239" end="01:45:51.440" style="s2">right fake news is the vestige of</p>

<p begin="01:45:57.920" end="01:46:02.719" style="s2">which is dishonest which doesn&#39;t tell</p>

<p begin="01:46:21.920" end="01:46:24.880" style="s2">think there&#39;s a this is a whole um</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.679" end="01:46:26.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole practice it&#39;s a whole</p>

<p begin="01:46:26.480" end="01:46:29.440" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.960" end="01:46:31.760" style="s2">in many ways maybe the most sacred sense</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.440" end="01:46:33.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.760" end="01:46:34.639" style="s2">let me do some sort of simple ones first</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.520" end="01:46:35.040" style="s2">and maybe do a deeper one after that</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.639" end="01:46:36.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.040" end="01:46:37.360" style="s2">it feels to me like it&#39;s going to take a</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.159" end="01:46:39.280" style="s2">little while to get the deeper thing to</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.360" end="01:46:41.840" style="s2">settle into clarity</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.280" end="01:46:42.480" style="s2">if at all um one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.840" end="01:46:46.080" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.480" end="01:46:47.199" style="s2">when i uh started creating some youtube</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.080" end="01:46:50.560" style="s2">videos</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.199" end="01:46:51.760" style="s2">and i should be very clear the the</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.560" end="01:46:53.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how many youtube videos i</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.760" end="01:46:55.360" style="s2">created maybe 30 and then now i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.600" end="01:46:57.119" style="s2">this friend of mine who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.360" end="01:46:58.719" style="s2">my friend&#39;s son is just creating more</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.119" end="01:46:59.920" style="s2">out of some videos i&#39;ve done probably</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.719" end="01:47:00.480" style="s2">one out of this because this that thing</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.920" end="01:47:04.159" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.480" end="01:47:04.960" style="s2">bits in this conversation so my um you</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.159" end="01:47:08.320" style="s2">know i was writing</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.960" end="01:47:08.719" style="s2">on medium if you wrote a oh 50 articles</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.320" end="01:47:10.159" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.719" end="01:47:11.760" style="s2">and i got to the point where it was just</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.159" end="01:47:14.080" style="s2">a lot of work and</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.760" end="01:47:14.960" style="s2">um i felt like it was more work than it</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.080" end="01:47:16.239" style="s2">was worth</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.960" end="01:47:17.520" style="s2">so my wife said well why don&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.239" end="01:47:18.639" style="s2">say it in a video maybe you could just</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.520" end="01:47:19.840" style="s2">record yourself saying it because you</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.639" end="01:47:20.400" style="s2">say it you know you talk to people all</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.840" end="01:47:21.600" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.400" end="01:47:23.440" style="s2">why don&#39;t you just record it and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.600" end="01:47:24.400" style="s2">just share it so that&#39;s what i did right</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.440" end="01:47:25.360" style="s2">that was that was the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.400" end="01:47:27.040" style="s2">end of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.360" end="01:47:28.639" style="s2">all right now one of the things i</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.040" end="01:47:32.239" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.639" end="01:47:36.880" style="s2">and it came in two flavors was there was</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.239" end="01:47:39.920" style="s2">clearly a deep sense</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.880" end="01:47:40.960" style="s2">a fundamental assumption that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.920" end="01:47:44.239" style="s2">expressing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.960" end="01:47:46.800" style="s2">at all in public you must be endeavoring</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.239" end="01:47:49.199" style="s2">to build a brand</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.800" end="01:47:50.239" style="s2">that if you are not be being a good</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.199" end="01:47:51.840" style="s2">marketer</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.239" end="01:47:55.360" style="s2">then you&#39;ve already missed the boat</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.840" end="01:47:57.199" style="s2">right to say something insightful</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.360" end="01:47:59.280" style="s2">it can only be valuable in the context</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.199" end="01:48:01.199" style="s2">of building your brand and i said in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.280" end="01:48:03.840" style="s2">sense of like people come to me and say</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.199" end="01:48:04.800" style="s2">um you&#39;re saying interesting things but</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.840" end="01:48:06.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get a million</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.800" end="01:48:07.920" style="s2">viewers if you don&#39;t do x y and z like</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.480" end="01:48:09.280" style="s2">those kinds of assumptions right</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.920" end="01:48:12.000" style="s2">the objective is to get a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.280" end="01:48:13.600" style="s2">attention ideally attention you can own</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.000" end="01:48:14.719" style="s2">and presumably monetize i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.600" end="01:48:16.480" style="s2">about that part</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.719" end="01:48:18.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s one side the other side was</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.480" end="01:48:20.960" style="s2">very similar even but even more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.000" end="01:48:22.000" style="s2">which was a anger at my failure for</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.960" end="01:48:25.600" style="s2">having done so</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.000" end="01:48:26.800" style="s2">so one side was kind of like a hint</p>

<p begin="01:48:28.000" end="01:48:30.719" style="s2">well the other side is actually anger</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.280" end="01:48:33.280" style="s2">for not doing a better job</p>

<p begin="01:48:42.400" end="01:48:47.360" style="s2">is to orient towards the relevant not</p>

<p begin="01:50:06.800" end="01:50:12.159" style="s2">very deep</p>

<p begin="01:50:30.480" end="01:50:33.199" style="s2">nonetheless is the thing that is</p>

<p begin="01:50:33.199" end="01:50:37.040" style="s2">i must speak it for you to hear it right</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.199" end="01:50:38.800" style="s2">i must draw it for you to see it</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.040" end="01:50:40.480" style="s2">but we can both perceive it in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.800" end="01:50:42.159" style="s2">transcendent and what i&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.480" end="01:50:45.199" style="s2">when i speak and when i draw</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.159" end="01:50:45.520" style="s2">is to give you hints to orient you into</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.199" end="01:50:47.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.520" end="01:50:49.360" style="s2">in your own mode of perception such that</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.599" end="01:50:51.040" style="s2">we are suddenly both perceiving the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.360" end="01:50:51.679" style="s2">transcendent object in the way that we</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.040" end="01:50:53.199" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.679" end="01:50:55.119" style="s2">and then to coordinate us so the</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.199" end="01:50:56.239" style="s2">speaking is not in the words the words</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.119" end="01:50:58.400" style="s2">are a protocol</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.239" end="01:51:00.400" style="s2">a way to create a communications channel</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.400" end="01:51:02.400" style="s2">so that we can become coordinated in our</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.400" end="01:51:04.239" style="s2">mutual perception of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.400" end="01:51:05.920" style="s2">that is another deep deep thing to learn</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.239" end="01:51:06.880" style="s2">to tell the truth right to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.920" end="01:51:09.119" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.880" end="01:51:10.800" style="s2">a communications channel to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.119" end="01:51:11.440" style="s2">actually actually achieve fidelity with</p>

<p begin="01:51:11.440" end="01:51:15.360" style="s2">and to mutually perceive the</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.199" end="01:51:17.760" style="s2">transcendent in a shared way</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.360" end="01:51:19.440" style="s2">that is the deepest or a very deep sense</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.760" end="01:51:22.080" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.440" end="01:51:22.639" style="s2">it reminds me of the johnny cash uh song</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.080" end="01:51:24.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.639" end="01:51:27.760" style="s2">about the man in black you know and he</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.560" end="01:51:27.760" style="s2">says um</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.400" end="01:51:31.920" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a line there that he</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.239" end="01:51:34.719" style="s2">says that i think</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.920" end="01:51:37.199" style="s2">kind of puts this into contrast for us</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.719" end="01:51:40.400" style="s2">that there is a false transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.199" end="01:51:42.960" style="s2">and the false transcendence again is the</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.400" end="01:51:44.800" style="s2">domain of the sacred of of the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.960" end="01:51:47.040" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.800" end="01:51:48.400" style="s2">the shared transcendence that people</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.040" end="01:51:50.080" style="s2">feel let&#39;s say let me give you an</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.400" end="01:51:51.679" style="s2">example stanley pawns and martin</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.080" end="01:51:55.520" style="s2">fleischmann you know those names</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.679" end="01:51:57.360" style="s2">yep why is stanley pons hiding in france</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.520" end="01:51:58.719" style="s2">to this day</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.360" end="01:52:00.960" style="s2">let me just think about that for a</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.719" end="01:52:03.679" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.960" end="01:52:06.239" style="s2">stanley ponds has gone off the grid for</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.679" end="01:52:08.480" style="s2">decades since 1989 when him and martin</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.239" end="01:52:09.840" style="s2">martin fleischmann passed away</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.480" end="01:52:11.920" style="s2">that he was one of the world&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.840" end="01:52:13.599" style="s2">chemists martin fleischmann</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.920" end="01:52:15.040" style="s2">so you have stanley ponds and martin</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.599" end="01:52:16.560" style="s2">fleischmann and they come out with this</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.040" end="01:52:17.840" style="s2">announcement that they have created what</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.560" end="01:52:20.320" style="s2">they believe to be cold</p>

<p begin="01:52:20.880" end="01:52:25.199" style="s2">and to this day we have an american</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.719" end="01:52:27.280" style="s2">stanley pons who has renounced his u.s</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.199" end="01:52:28.000" style="s2">citizenship and has been in france and</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.280" end="01:52:31.840" style="s2">obscurity</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.000" end="01:52:33.679" style="s2">since and hiding just he was so ashamed</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.840" end="01:52:36.800" style="s2">and vilified</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.679" end="01:52:38.239" style="s2">now that&#39;s the christ story</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.800" end="01:52:41.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not the complete story he was</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.239" end="01:52:43.040" style="s2">there&#39;s no vindication he still</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.199" end="01:52:45.520" style="s2">he&#39;s still i mean as we&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.040" end="01:52:47.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a man who tried to do something</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.520" end="01:52:50.239" style="s2">and i think he was earnest yeah and i</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.920" end="01:52:52.239" style="s2">think they made mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.239" end="01:52:53.920" style="s2">but he was vilified by the high priest</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.239" end="01:52:54.400" style="s2">because he touched the holy of holies he</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.920" end="01:52:56.480" style="s2">said</p>

<p begin="01:53:53.040" end="01:53:56.159" style="s2">about the way</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.000" end="01:53:57.920" style="s2">our bodies of knowledge are structured</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.159" end="01:54:00.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a man in france</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.920" end="01:54:01.520" style="s2">why we talk about science as a domain of</p>

<p begin="01:54:01.520" end="01:54:06.000" style="s2">the domain of rationality there&#39;s a man</p>

<p begin="01:54:06.800" end="01:54:14.000" style="s2">what about that at all sounds rational</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.639" end="01:54:17.199" style="s2">what about that process yes</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.000" end="01:54:19.840" style="s2">like the highest order of human</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.199" end="01:54:21.040" style="s2">you know togetherness or human</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.840" end="01:54:23.360" style="s2">understanding that that</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.040" end="01:54:25.920" style="s2">that sounds like old-fashioned religion</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.360" end="01:54:28.080" style="s2">to me that sounds like somebody just</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.920" end="01:54:29.440" style="s2">somebody spoke out a line and said i</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.080" end="01:54:30.800" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with your model of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.440" end="01:54:34.239" style="s2">trinity and they said</p>

<p begin="01:54:34.239" end="01:54:38.400" style="s2">and by the way we need to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.800" end="01:54:40.400" style="s2">nobody else shows up any</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.400" end="01:54:42.159" style="s2">big like you so you gotta be real done</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.400" end="01:54:42.880" style="s2">right and to this day if you type in</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.159" end="01:54:45.119" style="s2">it&#39;s now called</p>

<p begin="01:54:46.560" end="01:54:50.320" style="s2">there are still little groups in the</p>

<p begin="01:54:50.320" end="01:54:54.239" style="s2">and every now and then you&#39;ll get an</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.840" end="01:54:55.920" style="s2">article in a third tier science magazine</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.239" end="01:54:57.920" style="s2">maybe oh there&#39;s something there those</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.920" end="01:54:58.880" style="s2">crazy people are doing who knows maybe</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.920" end="01:55:01.280" style="s2">who knows but</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.880" end="01:55:02.080" style="s2">but wait a second you know the premise</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.280" end="01:55:04.880" style="s2">that you could create</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.080" end="01:55:06.800" style="s2">nuclear type energy in a tabletop device</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.880" end="01:55:08.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the biggest story in mankind</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.800" end="01:55:09.760" style="s2">history i mean isn&#39;t that what</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.400" end="01:55:11.440" style="s2">but no one&#39;s talking about it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.760" end="01:55:13.599" style="s2">talking about uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.440" end="01:55:15.280" style="s2">this is the generalized thing so let me</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.599" end="01:55:16.159" style="s2">let me um if you if you don&#39;t mind can i</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.280" end="01:55:19.840" style="s2">hold two points</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.159" end="01:55:23.119" style="s2">sure all right so the first point is</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.840" end="01:55:26.400" style="s2">um the the scapegoats who have been</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.119" end="01:55:26.800" style="s2">wandering in the wilderness we need to</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.400" end="01:55:29.119" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.800" end="01:55:30.480" style="s2">we need to love them unconditionally and</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.119" end="01:55:32.320" style="s2">by that i mean in the crucible</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.480" end="01:55:33.760" style="s2">right so because they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.320" end="01:55:34.719" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be up</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.760" end="01:55:36.239" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of damage</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.719" end="01:55:37.199" style="s2">right it ain&#39;t easy to walk alone in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.239" end="01:55:38.800" style="s2">wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.199" end="01:55:41.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s even worse so i mean both in</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.800" end="01:55:44.560" style="s2">terms of they will have emotional</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.040" end="01:55:45.679" style="s2">developmental issues right and i and i</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.560" end="01:55:47.040" style="s2">am among them so i know</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.679" end="01:55:48.719" style="s2">of what i speak and i&#39;m not i&#39;m not sort</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.040" end="01:55:49.920" style="s2">of pointing another folks and i spend a</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.719" end="01:55:50.239" style="s2">lot of time with these kinds of people</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.920" end="01:55:52.159" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.239" end="01:55:53.280" style="s2">the kinds of people who i like is</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.159" end="01:55:54.800" style="s2">another thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.280" end="01:55:56.639" style="s2">they&#39;ll have actually had to be without</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.800" end="01:55:58.719" style="s2">a community thinking about things in</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.639" end="01:55:59.840" style="s2">their own private language in their head</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.719" end="01:56:01.360" style="s2">which is they&#39;re going to have usually a</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.840" end="01:56:01.920" style="s2">very odd language they use words</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.360" end="01:56:03.199" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.920" end="01:56:04.000" style="s2">than other people next to them use words</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.199" end="01:56:05.360" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been using their own</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.000" end="01:56:07.599" style="s2">words for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.360" end="01:56:08.880" style="s2">and they may actually have concepts that</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.599" end="01:56:11.520" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.880" end="01:56:13.199" style="s2">four five seven levels of conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.520" end="01:56:15.119" style="s2">complexity deeper</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.199" end="01:56:16.400" style="s2">than we&#39;re typically using right because</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.119" end="01:56:18.239" style="s2">we&#39;re we stand on the</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.400" end="01:56:19.599" style="s2">shoulders of giants which means that we</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.239" end="01:56:20.880" style="s2">tend not to think too hard about those</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.599" end="01:56:21.920" style="s2">what those giants did</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.880" end="01:56:24.239" style="s2">if you&#39;ve been out in the wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.920" end="01:56:27.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve been thinking about um</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.239" end="01:56:28.560" style="s2">you know einsteinian riemannian</p>

<p begin="01:56:28.560" end="01:56:31.360" style="s2">and you&#39;re like you know what there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.840" end="01:56:33.199" style="s2">this branch this little this other</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.360" end="01:56:36.159" style="s2">approach that was being thought about</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.199" end="01:56:37.280" style="s2">in 1487 i&#39;m going to take that branch</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.159" end="01:56:38.400" style="s2">and you may have built something up</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.280" end="01:56:39.520" style="s2">right well there&#39;s going to be nobody</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.400" end="01:56:41.199" style="s2">who has a clue</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.520" end="01:56:43.280" style="s2">right and they&#39;re going to be very</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.199" end="01:56:44.320" style="s2">confused and maybe a little angry at you</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.280" end="01:56:45.920" style="s2">just because it&#39;s hard to understand</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.320" end="01:56:47.360" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about right so would</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.920" end="01:56:48.480" style="s2">you be very mindful of the fact that in</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.360" end="01:56:50.080" style="s2">many cases there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.480" end="01:56:53.040" style="s2">difficulty in communication</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.080" end="01:56:54.639" style="s2">right and there&#39;s going to be emotional</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.040" end="01:56:56.159" style="s2">fragility because they&#39;ve been they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.639" end="01:56:57.280" style="s2">used to being beat down they&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.159" end="01:56:58.560" style="s2">being yelled out they&#39;re used to being</p>

<p begin="01:56:58.560" end="01:57:01.760" style="s2">and if they&#39;re holding something</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.760" end="01:57:03.199" style="s2">valuable that&#39;s going to be even more</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.760" end="01:57:04.480" style="s2">intense because they have a deep thing</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.199" end="01:57:05.520" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been trying to figure out</p>

<p begin="01:58:35.760" end="01:58:39.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t like this physicist and this guy</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.679" end="01:58:40.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like my thing but together we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.599" end="01:58:42.639" style="s2">settled that</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.880" end="01:58:44.239" style="s2">this is the way the atom is you see i</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.639" end="01:58:45.760" style="s2">mean that&#39;s your that&#39;s how you bind</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.239" end="01:58:46.400" style="s2">together and when someone comes along</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.760" end="01:58:48.639" style="s2">and says</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.400" end="01:58:50.159" style="s2">no the adam&#39;s not that way then the</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.639" end="01:58:52.400" style="s2">shared togetherness of</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.159" end="01:58:54.480" style="s2">no we hate each other except we come</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.400" end="01:58:56.400" style="s2">together on these shared dogmas</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.480" end="01:58:58.320" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying that dogma&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.400" end="01:58:59.119" style="s2">that means we have nothing to bind us</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.320" end="01:59:01.679" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.119" end="01:59:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s apocalyptic for people in all</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.679" end="01:59:04.400" style="s2">fields of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.960" end="01:59:05.840" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s put into the second</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.400" end="01:59:06.800" style="s2">point so this is an example of that</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.840" end="01:59:08.639" style="s2">notion of thinking about money</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.800" end="01:59:10.239" style="s2">differently or economics differently</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.639" end="01:59:13.360" style="s2">i actually made this proposal to the</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.239" end="01:59:15.760" style="s2">obama administration in 2008</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.360" end="01:59:17.040" style="s2">which didn&#39;t go anywhere but i donated</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.760" end="01:59:20.159" style="s2">meaningfully to the obama</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.040" end="01:59:21.119" style="s2">campaign so i had got rich folk access</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.159" end="01:59:24.639" style="s2">so i got to</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.119" end="01:59:27.679" style="s2">talk to people um</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.639" end="01:59:28.480" style="s2">so the proposal was this i said look we</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.679" end="01:59:30.239" style="s2">currently spend</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.480" end="01:59:31.840" style="s2">x i&#39;m just gonna call it it&#39;s called 100</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.239" end="01:59:36.080" style="s2">billion dollars we spend x</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.840" end="01:59:37.840" style="s2">on science and you guys are about to put</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.080" end="01:59:39.520" style="s2">dump a ton of money into the economy</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.840" end="01:59:42.480" style="s2">remember what was it called</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.520" end="01:59:43.280" style="s2">not tarp but the uh rebuilding america</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.480" end="01:59:46.080" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.280" end="01:59:46.639" style="s2">bill what about cash for clunkers are</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.080" end="01:59:48.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.639" end="01:59:50.080" style="s2">no well we might as well be the same</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.320" end="01:59:51.599" style="s2">thing right and you&#39;re going to do a</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.080" end="01:59:52.400" style="s2">terrible terrible job at it that&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.599" end="01:59:53.599" style="s2">just going to tell you right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.400" end="01:59:56.560" style="s2">going you&#39;re going to waste</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.599" end="01:59:58.159" style="s2">trillions of dollars why don&#39;t we waste</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.560" end="02:00:00.400" style="s2">trillions of dollars intelligently</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.159" end="02:00:01.840" style="s2">like why don&#39;t we fail forward here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.400" end="02:00:04.560" style="s2">proposal</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.840" end="02:00:06.159" style="s2">100 billion dollars a year for the next</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.560" end="02:00:07.280" style="s2">four years</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.159" end="02:00:08.480" style="s2">five years you know if you want to be</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.280" end="02:00:10.080" style="s2">pretend like you&#39;re going to transcend</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.480" end="02:00:12.880" style="s2">your your uh</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.080" end="02:00:15.119" style="s2">being president for the first term</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.880" end="02:00:16.800" style="s2">allocated into a platform</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.119" end="02:00:17.920" style="s2">where every american citizen has the</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.800" end="02:00:19.119" style="s2">ability to you know prove their</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.920" end="02:00:20.159" style="s2">credentials get your social security</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.119" end="02:00:20.960" style="s2">number wherever it happens to be get</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.159" end="02:00:22.800" style="s2">your identity</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.960" end="02:00:24.880" style="s2">and each american citizen is given a pro</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.800" end="02:00:26.000" style="s2">rata share of that to allocate to any</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.880" end="02:00:28.000" style="s2">scientific or engineering</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.000" end="02:00:29.760" style="s2">endeavor that they see fit and so you</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.000" end="02:00:31.760" style="s2">basically take that money and fully</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.760" end="02:00:33.920" style="s2">decentralize it</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.760" end="02:00:36.000" style="s2">and of course the first order thought is</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.920" end="02:00:37.280" style="s2">well you got two problems one is people</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.000" end="02:00:38.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they should be funding</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.280" end="02:00:39.920" style="s2">people are dumb</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.400" end="02:00:41.119" style="s2">the second is people will tend to be</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.920" end="02:00:42.800" style="s2">there&#39;ll be some real corruption right</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.119" end="02:00:46.239" style="s2">they will give money to their friends</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.800" end="02:00:47.760" style="s2">and my response is number two yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.239" end="02:00:49.679" style="s2">probably vastly less than is currently</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.760" end="02:00:50.960" style="s2">being corrupted because they&#39;re not as</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.679" end="02:00:52.800" style="s2">good at it as you guys are because</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.960" end="02:00:55.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve been at it for a while</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.800" end="02:00:57.920" style="s2">and number one i&#39;m not so sure</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.840" end="02:00:59.040" style="s2">i i get the distinct sense and i i said</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.920" end="02:01:00.159" style="s2">here&#39;s the here&#39;s the math right the</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.040" end="02:01:02.000" style="s2">math looks like this</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.159" end="02:01:03.760" style="s2">when you run an optimizing function on a</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.000" end="02:01:06.239" style="s2">system that has can create niche</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.760" end="02:01:07.520" style="s2">niche production it can maintain the</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.239" end="02:01:08.000" style="s2">integrity of its own institutional</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.520" end="02:01:09.199" style="s2">fabric</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.000" end="02:01:11.280" style="s2">what you end up getting is you get</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.199" end="02:01:13.840" style="s2">increasingly narrow deep uh</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.280" end="02:01:15.280" style="s2">investigations right so i take a look at</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.840" end="02:01:16.560" style="s2">physics and i can look at chemistry and</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.280" end="02:01:18.480" style="s2">take a look at biology</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.560" end="02:01:19.599" style="s2">it tends to have this root structure it</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.480" end="02:01:20.320" style="s2">looks like a plant where i&#39;ve got these</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.599" end="02:01:23.040" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.320" end="02:01:24.400" style="s2">deep tap roots they go like that but if</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.040" end="02:01:26.320" style="s2">i look between them there&#39;s these big</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.400" end="02:01:28.080" style="s2">dark areas between these two roots right</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.320" end="02:01:30.000" style="s2">so i&#39;ve got real deep investigations of</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.080" end="02:01:31.760" style="s2">increasingly esoteric areas</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.000" end="02:01:33.280" style="s2">and vast territories in between that</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.760" end="02:01:36.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t being investigated</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.280" end="02:01:38.719" style="s2">if all i did was broke the structure</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.560" end="02:01:39.760" style="s2">so the money was effectively random like</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.719" end="02:01:41.440" style="s2">i literally said i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.760" end="02:01:42.800" style="s2">randomly allocated it could just be</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.440" end="02:01:44.719" style="s2">randomly allocated</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.800" end="02:01:47.040" style="s2">i would be willing to bet you would get</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.719" end="02:01:48.800" style="s2">one full order of magnitude and possibly</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.040" end="02:01:52.159" style="s2">two orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.800" end="02:01:54.400" style="s2">increase discovery in practical science</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.159" end="02:01:55.679" style="s2">through this program right so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.400" end="02:01:57.440" style="s2">example of the kind of thing like</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.679" end="02:01:59.040" style="s2">you know what let&#39;s just use basic</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.440" end="02:02:01.440" style="s2">sensibility when you&#39;ve been going at</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.040" end="02:02:03.360" style="s2">something for 50 or 60 or 80 years with</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.440" end="02:02:05.520" style="s2">the same basic institutional structure</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.360" end="02:02:07.840" style="s2">you could be damn sure that it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.520" end="02:02:10.320" style="s2">combination of corruption</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.840" end="02:02:12.960" style="s2">and bureaucratic cowardice that focuses</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.320" end="02:02:14.880" style="s2">on increasingly narrow and oftentimes</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.960" end="02:02:16.159" style="s2">cover your ass like don&#39;t you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.880" end="02:02:18.000" style="s2">investigate anything as long as what you</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.159" end="02:02:20.320" style="s2">do looks like investigation</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.000" end="02:02:21.920" style="s2">and if all you did was pop that thing</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.320" end="02:02:23.040" style="s2">open and make that money available to go</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.920" end="02:02:24.719" style="s2">decentralized</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.040" end="02:02:26.239" style="s2">you get a 10x increase in performance</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.719" end="02:02:27.199" style="s2">almost immediately my battery&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.239" end="02:02:28.880" style="s2">die so i&#39;ve got to move</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.199" end="02:02:32.080" style="s2">i think australia i think our time is up</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.880" end="02:02:34.400" style="s2">too yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.080" end="02:02:35.840" style="s2">so and we could do that right that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.400" end="02:02:37.920" style="s2">that hard these days we have a technical</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.840" end="02:02:40.400" style="s2">basis to make that extremely possible</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.920" end="02:02:42.880" style="s2">if we could get the get the ear if one</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.400" end="02:02:44.800" style="s2">can imagine a situation where</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.880" end="02:02:47.040" style="s2">the this all right i&#39;ll go two pieces</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.800" end="02:02:49.280" style="s2">and maybe we&#39;ll end on that</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.040" end="02:02:50.320" style="s2">so right now we&#39;re not just wasting a</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.280" end="02:02:52.560" style="s2">trillion dollars we&#39;re wasting ten</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.320" end="02:02:54.239" style="s2">trillion dollars and probably more</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.560" end="02:02:56.159" style="s2">and wasting wasting like seriously</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.239" end="02:02:57.599" style="s2">massively wasting like to prop up the</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.159" end="02:03:01.199" style="s2">too big to fail banks is</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.599" end="02:03:02.320" style="s2">is an absurdity beyond comprehension um</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.199" end="02:03:04.320" style="s2">you know if you think about in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.320" end="02:03:07.520" style="s2">like parasitism and then</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.320" end="02:03:10.560" style="s2">um no would it be</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.520" end="02:03:11.760" style="s2">sophisticated enemies parasites and then</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.560" end="02:03:12.719" style="s2">and then things that just aren&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.760" end="02:03:14.239" style="s2">efficient</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.719" end="02:03:16.080" style="s2">the banks are somewhere to the left side</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.239" end="02:03:18.080" style="s2">of that continuum um</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.080" end="02:03:19.199" style="s2">and there&#39;s certainly nowhere near uh</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.080" end="02:03:21.440" style="s2">need to be around</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.199" end="02:03:23.199" style="s2">all right so if i&#39;m dropping 10 trillion</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.440" end="02:03:25.199" style="s2">dollars into the economy just to stave</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.199" end="02:03:26.320" style="s2">off deflationary spiral</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.199" end="02:03:27.840" style="s2">maybe we could be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.320" end="02:03:28.239" style="s2">clever about it we could actually do it</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.840" end="02:03:29.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.239" end="02:03:31.599" style="s2">a new way and there&#39;s a lot of cool ways</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.760" end="02:03:32.880" style="s2">you could do it right you could just</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.599" end="02:03:34.239" style="s2">like i just said i could just create a</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.880" end="02:03:35.920" style="s2">whole platform and say hey american</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.239" end="02:03:38.159" style="s2">citizens here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.920" end="02:03:39.760" style="s2">each of you are going to get 50 000 to</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.159" end="02:03:42.080" style="s2">invest over the next</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.760" end="02:03:43.199" style="s2">36 months and we&#39;re going to do it in a</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.080" end="02:03:44.639" style="s2">cool digital way</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.199" end="02:03:46.000" style="s2">and the way the investment works is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.639" end="02:03:48.159" style="s2">going to be like the uh you know the</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.000" end="02:03:50.320" style="s2">work projects administration</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.159" end="02:03:52.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t give it to yourself you got to</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.320" end="02:03:53.360" style="s2">give it to some other project we create</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.000" end="02:03:54.639" style="s2">a platform people create projects</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.360" end="02:03:55.119" style="s2">everybody&#39;s going to get money that they</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.639" end="02:03:56.719" style="s2">invest</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.119" end="02:03:58.400" style="s2">the first move is you have to invest in</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.719" end="02:03:59.280" style="s2">another project and yep there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.400" end="02:04:00.639" style="s2">be some corruption</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.280" end="02:04:01.760" style="s2">a lot less corruption than you see in</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.639" end="02:04:03.199" style="s2">any other project that gets funded</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.760" end="02:04:04.639" style="s2">through any existing bureaucracy but</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.199" end="02:04:05.679" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get a level of creativity</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.639" end="02:04:07.199" style="s2">the likes of which we haven&#39;t seen in</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.679" end="02:04:08.639" style="s2">100 years</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.199" end="02:04:10.000" style="s2">all right and maybe it&#39;s not 10 billion</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.639" end="02:04:11.840" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just a trillion maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.000" end="02:04:13.040" style="s2">just a trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.840" end="02:04:15.599" style="s2">but think about it think about the</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.040" end="02:04:17.040" style="s2">insanity all right that&#39;s one now</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.599" end="02:04:18.560" style="s2">the naive part of that is not the</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.040" end="02:04:20.239" style="s2">topology i just described and by the way</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.560" end="02:04:21.920" style="s2">i can give you a topology which is</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.239" end="02:04:22.800" style="s2">a hundred times more effective than that</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.920" end="02:04:23.520" style="s2">we just sort of thought it through a</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.800" end="02:04:24.639" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.520" end="02:04:26.480" style="s2">the naive part of that is not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.639" end="02:04:28.480" style="s2">apology obviously right the naive part</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.480" end="02:04:29.679" style="s2">is to assume there are any ears to hear</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.480" end="02:04:30.800" style="s2">at the top of the choice making</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.679" end="02:04:32.159" style="s2">structure that would even vaguely</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.800" end="02:04:34.880" style="s2">consider that as a thing to do</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.159" end="02:04:37.280" style="s2">for about 50 different reasons that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.880" end="02:04:38.560" style="s2">the second move right the second move is</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.280" end="02:04:41.119" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go ahead and have to take</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.560" end="02:04:42.560" style="s2">sovereignty back i got bad news for you</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.119" end="02:04:45.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to be able to vote for</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.560" end="02:04:46.639" style="s2">anybody and sort of ordinary voting</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.040" end="02:04:47.920" style="s2">we may be able to continue to vote for a</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.639" end="02:04:49.119" style="s2">while that may actually still have some</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.920" end="02:04:51.119" style="s2">legitimacy</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.119" end="02:04:52.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s not going to be a situation</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.119" end="02:04:53.520" style="s2">where you&#39;re gonna a politician&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.560" end="02:04:54.719" style="s2">come to you and make you a promise</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.520" end="02:04:56.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna vote for that</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.719" end="02:04:57.360" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to take sovereignty</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.000" end="02:04:58.560" style="s2">back that&#39;s the only way this thing</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.360" end="02:04:59.599" style="s2">happens the people are gonna have to</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.560" end="02:05:01.599" style="s2">wake up and say whoa</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.599" end="02:05:02.960" style="s2"> we&#39;ve been sitting around not doing</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.599" end="02:05:04.639" style="s2">anything for a while jefferson and the</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.960" end="02:05:06.400" style="s2">boys kind of did a good job and every</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.639" end="02:05:08.560" style="s2">you know our friends back in the in the</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.400" end="02:05:10.639" style="s2">1860s in the 1930s kind of</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.560" end="02:05:12.560" style="s2">did a revved at this thing but at the</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.639" end="02:05:14.079" style="s2">end of the day the buck stops here and</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.560" end="02:05:15.360" style="s2">that here is right here</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.079" end="02:05:16.639" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna have to step in we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.360" end="02:05:17.840" style="s2">gonna have to look around say they</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.639" end="02:05:19.199" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna say this and most of the</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.840" end="02:05:20.400" style="s2">time when they say they&#39;re gonna save us</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.199" end="02:05:22.560" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be screwing us</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.400" end="02:05:24.719" style="s2">take responsibility back figure out what</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.560" end="02:05:26.719" style="s2">the what a right right design looks like</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.719" end="02:05:28.159" style="s2">execute on that design and either force</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.719" end="02:05:30.159" style="s2">them to do it</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.159" end="02:05:32.000" style="s2">or just do it ourselves and because the</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.159" end="02:05:33.119" style="s2">end of the day like i talked to somebody</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.000" end="02:05:35.920" style="s2">about this in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.119" end="02:05:37.599" style="s2">like a big company let&#39;s say google</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.920" end="02:05:39.760" style="s2">google&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.599" end="02:05:40.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no google there&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.760" end="02:05:43.760" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.800" end="02:05:45.440" style="s2">who do things and they&#39;ve agreed as</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.760" end="02:05:46.719" style="s2">people to do things in a certain way</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.440" end="02:05:48.560" style="s2">according to certain hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.719" end="02:05:50.159" style="s2">certain rules and processes and that set</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.560" end="02:05:51.440" style="s2">of agreements becomes the thing that we</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.159" end="02:05:53.520" style="s2">know is google</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.440" end="02:05:54.800" style="s2">those people change their agreements</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.520" end="02:05:56.159" style="s2">they&#39;d be doing something else</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.800" end="02:05:57.920" style="s2">and google would no longer exist as a</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.159" end="02:05:59.199" style="s2">viable entity</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.920" end="02:06:00.719" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole country right the whole</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.199" end="02:06:01.119" style="s2">country is every single thing you have</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.719" end="02:06:02.719" style="s2">every</p>

<p begin="02:06:02.719" end="02:06:05.840" style="s2">see that is real is not real</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.159" end="02:06:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s people making choices and what</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.840" end="02:06:09.440" style="s2">agreements they want to make</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.840" end="02:06:11.119" style="s2">we can make new agreements we can always</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.440" end="02:06:12.560" style="s2">do that that paul has always been rested</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.119" end="02:06:14.079" style="s2">in the people sovereignty is that the</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.560" end="02:06:15.599" style="s2">ability to make the choices that you</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.079" end="02:06:16.480" style="s2">make and own the responsibility for</p>

<p begin="02:06:17.679" end="02:06:21.119" style="s2">to make i can tell you right now there</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.280" end="02:06:21.520" style="s2">is no path through this does not go</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.119" end="02:06:24.480" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.520" end="02:06:25.920" style="s2">us as a people reclaiming sovereignty</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.480" end="02:06:27.199" style="s2">making the choices that we choose to</p>

<p begin="02:06:27.760" end="02:06:30.800" style="s2">take responsibility again and</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.280" end="02:06:31.760" style="s2">sovereignty is responsibility more than</p>

<p begin="02:06:31.760" end="02:06:35.679" style="s2">and then be begin to make new agreements</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.920" end="02:06:37.119" style="s2">and maybe we can execute on that through</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.679" end="02:06:38.400" style="s2">the vote</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.119" end="02:06:40.320" style="s2">right but if we do it it&#39;s gonna be more</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.400" end="02:06:43.119" style="s2">like this it&#39;s gonna be uh</p>

<p begin="02:06:45.840" end="02:06:49.040" style="s2">at that kind of thing here&#39;s the list of</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.360" end="02:06:50.719" style="s2">things you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.040" end="02:06:52.000" style="s2">now your job is not to figure out what</p>

<p begin="02:07:12.159" end="02:07:16.000" style="s2">third is to actually create an illusion</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.639" end="02:07:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s awake from our illusions we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:07:33.840" end="02:07:38.239" style="s2">worst case scenario</p>

<p begin="02:08:31.199" end="02:08:33.920" style="s2">that&#39;s just silliness</p>

<p begin="02:08:37.040" end="02:08:40.079" style="s2">um be friends learn how to be friends</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.280" end="02:08:41.520" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.079" end="02:08:44.480" style="s2">i learn how to engage in what it means</p>

<p begin="02:08:44.480" end="02:08:47.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny the thing that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.159" end="02:08:51.040" style="s2">noticed over the past</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.599" end="02:08:52.320" style="s2">two years and i&#39;ve made a distinction so</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.040" end="02:08:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of thinking about in terms</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.320" end="02:08:56.560" style="s2">of team balloon team red</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.320" end="02:08:58.000" style="s2">and i think that that distinction</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.560" end="02:08:59.440" style="s2">creates a little bit of confusion and</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.000" end="02:09:00.320" style="s2">more attention than it needs to</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.440" end="02:09:02.079" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to make a slightly</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.320" end="02:09:03.440" style="s2">different distinction and some people</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.079" end="02:09:05.440" style="s2">might be laughing when i say it</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.440" end="02:09:06.639" style="s2">american distinction between between</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.440" end="02:09:09.840" style="s2">team must have</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.639" end="02:09:11.199" style="s2">and team nice to have and team must have</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.840" end="02:09:12.320" style="s2">are the folks where if they decide to</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.199" end="02:09:14.400" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.320" end="02:09:15.760" style="s2">everything falls apart and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.400" end="02:09:18.000" style="s2">of them we&#39;re seeing them right now in</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.760" end="02:09:19.520" style="s2">the food chain</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.000" end="02:09:20.960" style="s2">seemed nice to have for folks who if</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.520" end="02:09:22.159" style="s2">they stopped if they stopped doing what</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.960" end="02:09:23.599" style="s2">they did</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.159" end="02:09:25.360" style="s2">either we wouldn&#39;t notice we&#39;d be glad</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.599" end="02:09:27.440" style="s2">they did</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.360" end="02:09:28.480" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t need those and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.440" end="02:09:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s really an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.480" end="02:09:30.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.800" end="02:09:31.599" style="s2">as i&#39;ve noticed over the past two years</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.159" end="02:09:33.520" style="s2">is when i have conversations with folks</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.599" end="02:09:35.119" style="s2">who are on team must have</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.520" end="02:09:37.199" style="s2">they tend to nod their head in what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.119" end="02:09:39.119" style="s2">saying and if they disagree we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.199" end="02:09:40.800" style="s2">to disagree honestly</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.119" end="02:09:42.320" style="s2">we can usually find a compromise that</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.800" end="02:09:45.280" style="s2">works and usually it&#39;s a collaboration</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.320" end="02:09:46.880" style="s2">that actually is a better solution</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.280" end="02:09:48.560" style="s2">i think largely because if you if you</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.880" end="02:09:50.000" style="s2">live your life actually having to solve</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.560" end="02:09:51.679" style="s2">problems with nature</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.000" end="02:09:54.400" style="s2">you know the way i&#39;ve described in the</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.679" end="02:09:56.880" style="s2">past is uh if the pipe bursts</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.400" end="02:09:57.679" style="s2">do you grab a wrench do you call a</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.880" end="02:10:00.639" style="s2">plumber</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.679" end="02:10:02.320" style="s2">or do you call the supervisor if you</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.639" end="02:10:04.159" style="s2">grab the wrench you tend to have a</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.320" end="02:10:06.400" style="s2">certain set of capacities to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.159" end="02:10:07.599" style="s2">how to solve problems with other people</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.400" end="02:10:09.280" style="s2">because you&#39;re aware of the fact that no</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.599" end="02:10:11.679" style="s2">matter how much you complain or whine or</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.280" end="02:10:13.360" style="s2">control or manipulate</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.679" end="02:10:15.119" style="s2">nature&#39;s nature you better just figure</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.360" end="02:10:18.639" style="s2">out how to figure how to make it work</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.119" end="02:10:19.599" style="s2">if you call the super that gets really</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.639" end="02:10:22.320" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.599" end="02:10:23.679" style="s2">you use words like problematic because</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.320" end="02:10:24.880" style="s2">most of the way you solve problems that</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.679" end="02:10:27.040" style="s2">you figure out how to convince other</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.880" end="02:10:29.199" style="s2">people to do the things you want to do</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.040" end="02:10:31.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s a totally different game and</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.199" end="02:10:32.880" style="s2">hard to collaborate in a space of people</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.040" end="02:10:34.960" style="s2">who are optimized for manipulating other</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.880" end="02:10:37.679" style="s2">people to do what they want to do</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.960" end="02:10:38.880" style="s2">um so anyway so largely when i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.679" end="02:10:39.599" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying i&#39;m actually speaking to</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.880" end="02:10:41.520" style="s2">team</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.599" end="02:10:42.719" style="s2">must-have i&#39;m not so much worried that</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.520" end="02:10:44.239" style="s2">right now about team nice to have</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.719" end="02:10:45.119" style="s2">because if team must have gets its act</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.239" end="02:10:46.880" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.119" end="02:10:48.079" style="s2">looks around says we&#39;re gonna take</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.880" end="02:10:49.280" style="s2">responsibility for this thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.079" end="02:10:51.360" style="s2">gonna design it</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.280" end="02:10:52.800" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna sign up for it we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.360" end="02:10:54.880" style="s2">accept the fact that it may be rough</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.800" end="02:10:56.159" style="s2">maybe rough going for a little while</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.880" end="02:10:57.520" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to go there we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.159" end="02:10:59.440" style="s2">to make it happen and we&#39;ll make an</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.520" end="02:11:01.360" style="s2">offer to team nice to have to join</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.440" end="02:11:02.639" style="s2">on the terms we&#39;ve defined and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.360" end="02:11:04.079" style="s2">good terms right we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.639" end="02:11:06.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a much better world we can get to</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.079" end="02:11:07.119" style="s2">and we can get to the promised land in a</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.320" end="02:11:11.840" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.119" end="02:11:11.840" style="s2">old testament sense um</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.159" end="02:11:15.920" style="s2">team nice to have is going to take those</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.599" end="02:11:17.679" style="s2">terms pretty quick</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.920" end="02:11:19.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i got about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.679" end="02:11:22.320" style="s2">very good it&#39;s not going to come through</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.599" end="02:11:24.320" style="s2">um government bureaucracy or</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.320" end="02:11:25.360" style="s2">universities that have that power</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.320" end="02:11:28.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.360" end="02:11:30.400" style="s2">that would be like henry ford trying to</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.320" end="02:11:32.159" style="s2">position himself to introduce a new way</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.400" end="02:11:33.760" style="s2">of transportation and at the time</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.159" end="02:11:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a department of transportation</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.760" end="02:11:35.760" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.480" end="02:11:37.520" style="s2">excuse me what are we going to do about</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.760" end="02:11:39.199" style="s2">the horseshoe makers we&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.520" end="02:11:42.000" style="s2">running this bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.199" end="02:11:43.119" style="s2">you said i mean if the horseshoe makers</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.000" end="02:11:44.880" style="s2">are in charge of the department of</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.119" end="02:11:45.199" style="s2">transportation they would never allow</p>

<p begin="02:11:46.880" end="02:11:49.920" style="s2">to exist</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.239" end="02:11:51.760" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve got to stop asking</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.920" end="02:11:52.639" style="s2">permission of the horseshoe makers of</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.760" end="02:11:54.480" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.639" end="02:11:55.920" style="s2">and just start creating the technology</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.480" end="02:11:57.679" style="s2">that people need</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.920" end="02:11:59.280" style="s2">yeah yeah every one of these</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.679" end="02:12:00.560" style="s2">institutions was created by regular old</p>

<p begin="02:12:05.199" end="02:12:09.760" style="s2">so the the myth of the man is really</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.599" end="02:12:12.480" style="s2">just us isn&#39;t it it&#39;s just the crowd</p>
