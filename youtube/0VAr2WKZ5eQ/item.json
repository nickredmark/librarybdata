    "title": "Jordan Hall, David Gornoski on Rene Girard, Gospel Technology vs Myth",
    "description": "Technologist and public intellectual Jordan Hall joins David Gornoski, host of A Neighbor's Choice, for a journey through sense-making in 2020. Along the way, Rene Girard's mimetic theory is explored in relation to physics, media ecology, and the unraveling of political faith and cohesion in our time. Where are we heading after the lockdown? How do we bind ourselves together with stories and role models based in voluntary love, rather than coerced submission? What is the difference between the story of Jesus and myth?\nEmail hello@aneighborschoice.com to reach A Neighbor's Choice.
