<p begin="00:02:56.330" end="00:03:02.330" style="s2">here Tyson and when I heard that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.910" end="00:03:04.280" style="s2">I was like that&#39;s what I want in my life</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.330" end="00:03:06.500" style="s2">maybe you could give us a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.280" end="00:03:14.300" style="s2">introduction like what what is radical</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.500" end="00:03:19.100" style="s2">honesty mean for you hmm well radical</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.300" end="00:03:21.170" style="s2">honesty was the the first time my book</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.100" end="00:03:22.820" style="s2">came out was called telling the truth it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.170" end="00:03:26.600" style="s2">was in hardback and it didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.820" end="00:03:28.610" style="s2">great and I went to a few book</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.600" end="00:03:31.790" style="s2">conventions and started learning</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.610" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">something about marketing and what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.790" end="00:03:35.780" style="s2">word would rephrase that used in it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:37.640" style="s2">hadn&#39;t put in the title was radical</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.780" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">honesty when I changed the title to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.640" end="00:03:42.830" style="s2">radical honesty how to transform your</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:44.140" style="s2">life by telling the truth it became a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.830" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">best-seller</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.140" end="00:03:48.260" style="s2">because before everybody thought they</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">knew about telling the truth but nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.260" end="00:03:53.330" style="s2">thought they knew anything about radical</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:56.920" style="s2">honesty so basically I started watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:04:01.060" style="s2">how I said things and saying them</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.920" end="00:04:03.350" style="s2">uncovering more the general idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.060" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re willing to share what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.350" end="00:04:10.250" style="s2">notice that you are acknowledging there</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:14.090" style="s2">by that noticing is more important than</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.250" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">thinking and that thesis that noticing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.090" end="00:04:19.340" style="s2">is more important than thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">throughout the whole series of radical</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:26.360" style="s2">honesty books mmm-hmm so it&#39;s let me see</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">if I can completely get this it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.360" end="00:04:32.570" style="s2">kind of our culturally predisposed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">over think as opposed to just really</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.570" end="00:04:36.229" style="s2">noticing what is actually happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">this moment is that accurate</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.229" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">yeah but almost anything is overthinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.310" end="00:04:45.100" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:49.210" style="s2">our whole culture our whole tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.100" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">to overvalue thinking and part of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.210" end="00:04:55.870" style="s2">we say is that thinking itself is not as</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:58.449" style="s2">important period as we think it is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.870" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">there&#39;s something about thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.449" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">leads us towards dishonesty there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">implicitly likely to lead you away from</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:21.370" style="s2">honesty in the sense that you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:23.710" style="s2">concerned the further you go into your</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.370" end="00:05:28.150" style="s2">ideation the more you&#39;re concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.710" end="00:05:29.800" style="s2">the performance of the idea and the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.150" end="00:05:31.720" style="s2">concerned you are about convincing other</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.800" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">people&#39;s about right you are and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.720" end="00:05:42.759" style="s2">forth so that basically we have a model</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:45.250" style="s2">of awareness which is that you can take</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.759" end="00:05:47.949" style="s2">everything you can possibly be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.250" end="00:05:49.990" style="s2">in your life and easily divided into</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.949" end="00:05:53.830" style="s2">three categories you can notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.990" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">going on in front of you right now that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.830" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">is what you see here and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:01.479" style="s2">you can also be aware of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:04.539" style="s2">within the confines of your own skin</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.479" end="00:06:08.259" style="s2">right now like some at like feeling with</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.539" end="00:06:13.210" style="s2">so much stuff yeah and you can also be</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.259" end="00:06:15.610" style="s2">aware of what you&#39;re thinking and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.210" end="00:06:19.000" style="s2">all there is there isn&#39;t anymore</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.610" end="00:06:21.370" style="s2">we call it inside outside upside down</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.000" end="00:06:26.979" style="s2">and this we call upside down because</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.370" end="00:06:31.630" style="s2">usually it&#39;s bullshit something about</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.979" end="00:06:33.430" style="s2">like just observing what is as opposed I</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.630" end="00:06:36.069" style="s2">guess as you said anytime I start</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.430" end="00:06:39.099" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s an interpretation it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.069" end="00:06:42.940" style="s2">story it&#39;s an analysis it&#39;s it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.099" end="00:06:44.889" style="s2">away from just observing yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.940" end="00:06:50.169" style="s2">right it&#39;s at least a step or two away</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.889" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">because as when you start noticing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.169" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">you&#39;re noticing you can sort of judge</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:57.069" style="s2">how much time you primarily focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:07:00.190" style="s2">thinking and how much time are you</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.069" end="00:07:01.900" style="s2">focused on noticing your body and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.190" end="00:07:07.449" style="s2">much time have you focused on noticing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.900" end="00:07:09.940" style="s2">things outside of you and are you one</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.449" end="00:07:11.889" style="s2">important dimension that Fritz Perls</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.940" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">taught me I was trained in Gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.889" end="00:07:20.500" style="s2">therapy and okay and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:21.700" style="s2">he used to stress was the in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.500" end="00:07:23.290" style="s2">him thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.700" end="00:07:25.330" style="s2">difference between noticing and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.290" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">was that noticing was much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.330" end="00:07:30.850" style="s2">important but one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:36.250" style="s2">extract in that he stressed a lot was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.850" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">that if you are in contact with someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.250" end="00:07:44.410" style="s2">else the quality of the communication is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:46.900" style="s2">much more intense and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.410" end="00:07:50.410" style="s2">withdrawn from someone else it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.900" end="00:07:52.750" style="s2">less intense and so he talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.410" end="00:07:56.140" style="s2">dimension called contact and withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.750" end="00:07:58.750" style="s2">oh and I was reveal aberrated on it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.140" end="00:08:00.250" style="s2">that I say visual contact is you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.750" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">looking each other right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.250" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">verbal contacts are speaking to each</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.590" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">other right now and so forth so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:13.810" style="s2">the visual contact verbal contact</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:16.390" style="s2">ideational contact so you can be I can</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.730" end="00:08:28.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve based on 35 years of practice of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.660" end="00:08:32.590" style="s2">psychotherapy in Washington DC where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.780" end="00:08:37.090" style="s2">largest majority of my clientele were</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.590" end="00:08:39.310" style="s2">lawyers I had to actually naturally</p>

<p begin="00:08:45.310" end="00:08:55.150" style="s2">that&#39;s right and I did a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.380" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">writing about couples and about child</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.150" end="00:08:59.800" style="s2">rearing and one of my favorite books is</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.800" end="00:09:06.310" style="s2">tell parents of young kids is what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.210" end="00:09:08.860" style="s2">have to teach your child is not as</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.310" end="00:09:13.000" style="s2">important as what they have to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.860" end="00:09:15.640" style="s2">they know that what they remind you of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.000" end="00:09:19.840" style="s2">that you forgot is much more valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.640" end="00:09:22.780" style="s2">you and to them via you than anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.840" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to teach them so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.780" end="00:09:26.620" style="s2">going out there and trying to gear up</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:28.060" style="s2">with what they need to know and put</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.620" end="00:09:30.220" style="s2">forces on them</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.060" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2">you should just touch their feet and say</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.220" end="00:09:34.390" style="s2">what should I do to serve you today</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.260" end="00:09:36.610" style="s2">master</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.610" end="00:09:41.829" style="s2">beauty of a child&#39;s just it really is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">kind of radical honesty like they just</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:48.940" style="s2">honey like don&#39;t say that and I go to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.149" end="00:09:51.670" style="s2">the store and I think it&#39;s like a we</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.940" end="00:09:54.940" style="s2">slowly condition that radical honesty</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.670" end="00:09:57.029" style="s2">out of them and I hear you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.940" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">actually it&#39;s an opportunity for them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.029" end="00:10:03.070" style="s2">recondition us yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:04.990" style="s2">it&#39;s an opportunity to rest remind what</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.070" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">we forgot when we&#39;re thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.990" end="00:10:10.120" style="s2">instead of really being with it in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:12.070" style="s2">memory mm-hmm so there&#39;s a couple like</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.120" end="00:10:13.690" style="s2">little roads that I really want to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.070" end="00:10:16.810" style="s2">down and I just want to say for those</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.690" end="00:10:18.339" style="s2">who are joining us feel free to put some</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.029" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">going while the questions are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:38.589" style="s2">building up I&#39;m wondering Brad you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:42.010" style="s2">talked about being a psychotherapist for</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.589" end="00:10:44.260" style="s2">a bunch of lawyers was there like a an</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.010" end="00:10:46.930" style="s2">epiphany moment for you like was there</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.260" end="00:10:49.029" style="s2">what was the catalyst in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.930" end="00:10:52.029" style="s2">environment where you were like okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.029" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">it&#39;s gotta be about radical honesty or</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.029" end="00:10:55.779" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be about telling the full</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">truth I&#39;m wondering what the what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.779" end="00:11:02.500" style="s2">birth was of this idea it wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:06.490" style="s2">one AHA experience it was a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.500" end="00:11:08.620" style="s2">and I was also part of my background as</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.490" end="00:11:11.589" style="s2">I got in the civil rights movement in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.620" end="00:11:15.070" style="s2">Texas and throughout the South when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.589" end="00:11:18.699" style="s2">was 19 years old which was 1959 I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.070" end="00:11:22.329" style="s2">80 at a few months basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.699" end="00:11:25.329" style="s2">I spent a lot of time in the civil</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.329" end="00:11:27.910" style="s2">rights movement I did get shot at red</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.329" end="00:11:33.430" style="s2">bike bombed and put in jail arrested 15</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.910" end="00:11:35.380" style="s2">times or so and basically I also was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.430" end="00:11:39.399" style="s2">hippie and I started taking acid when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.380" end="00:11:42.250" style="s2">was 20 and did lots of LSD and basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.399" end="00:11:45.819" style="s2">all of us knew who were about 30 when we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.250" end="00:11:49.060" style="s2">said don&#39;t trust anyone over 30 we met</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.819" end="00:11:53.720" style="s2">it even after we were over 30</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.060" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2">and has something to do with realizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.720" end="00:11:58.279" style="s2">that people in positions of authority</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">are not authoritative that generally</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.279" end="00:12:02.810" style="s2">they&#39;re just as full of shit as they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">be and that now and then if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.810" end="00:12:05.779" style="s2">completely full of shit they&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:09.260" style="s2">full of shit</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.779" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">and so that entered into you the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.260" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2">that I did therapy to you if people were</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">not willing to tell the truth in their</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:17.540" style="s2">relationships to other people I just</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:19.430" style="s2">said that&#39;s in I&#39;m not singing in</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.540" end="00:12:22.339" style="s2">therapy go find another therapist who</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.430" end="00:12:23.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what the job is and after I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.339" end="00:12:26.690" style="s2">had done that for about 20 years I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.900" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">finally wrote a book about it so there</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.690" end="00:12:32.000" style="s2">was this like inherent distrust of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.250" style="s2">man of the system because of what was</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:36.050" style="s2">happening culturally at that time and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.250" end="00:12:38.360" style="s2">sounds like that bled in to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.050" end="00:12:39.740" style="s2">practice and you&#39;re just like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:42.140" style="s2">mean it&#39;s almost like some of your</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.740" end="00:12:44.930" style="s2">clients might have represented that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.140" end="00:12:46.790" style="s2">authority and what an exciting</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.930" end="00:12:50.450" style="s2">opportunity for you to confront them and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.790" end="00:12:53.330" style="s2">say your bullshit won&#39;t stand like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.450" end="00:12:59.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not yeah a lot of their lawyers are</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.330" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">so retired when you retire at 30 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.000" end="00:13:07.520" style="s2">got like the possibility of a new career</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">yeah when these are gone I was just</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.520" end="00:13:14.360" style="s2">gonna say that the life of sharing what</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:16.220" style="s2">you notice when you feel free to tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.360" end="00:13:19.400" style="s2">things that are not conventionally</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.220" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">considered okay to talk about is a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.400" end="00:13:23.300" style="s2">nourishing life you feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:26.630" style="s2">able to relate to people in ways you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.300" end="00:13:29.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t been before and then it serves</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.630" end="00:13:32.350" style="s2">as an invitation and that invitation is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.960" end="00:13:36.440" style="s2">very attractive to other people so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.350" end="00:13:38.420" style="s2">we started having little communities of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.440" end="00:13:41.110" style="s2">people who grew up around what I ran a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.420" end="00:13:43.700" style="s2">place called the Center for wellbeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.110" end="00:13:45.560" style="s2">and the community just grew up naturally</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.700" end="00:13:49.220" style="s2">because when people finished with</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.560" end="00:13:50.900" style="s2">therapy in about a year or so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.220" end="00:13:52.970" style="s2">about what they got but they would also</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.900" end="00:13:55.250" style="s2">come around we would do workshop or</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.970" end="00:13:57.709" style="s2">something because they liked sharing</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.250" end="00:13:59.930" style="s2">what they&#39;d learned with other people so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.709" end="00:14:01.420" style="s2">it became ran more and more group</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.930" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">therapy groups and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.420" end="00:14:06.400" style="s2">workshops and eventually I designed a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:10.210" style="s2">workshop called the eight-day workshop</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.400" end="00:14:13.050" style="s2">which was to give people the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.210" end="00:14:17.050" style="s2">the year of psychotherapy and eight days</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.050" end="00:14:18.910" style="s2">intensive workshops and there&#39;s a free</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.050" end="00:14:21.220" style="s2">radical honesty like this was just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.910" end="00:14:23.350" style="s2">building up to that this was during the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.220" end="00:14:25.720" style="s2">evolution of radical honesty that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.350" end="00:14:28.210" style="s2">writing up a lot of that was what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.720" end="00:14:29.740" style="s2">book radical honesty came out in 94 I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.210" end="00:14:32.410" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.740" end="00:14:35.260" style="s2">who&#39;s that I imagine there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.410" end="00:14:37.510" style="s2">contagious quality you start being more</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.260" end="00:14:39.160" style="s2">honest your peers start being more</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.510" end="00:14:40.510" style="s2">honest their families start being more</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.160" end="00:14:41.050" style="s2">honest and it kind of ripples out from</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.510" end="00:14:45.100" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.050" end="00:14:47.170" style="s2">good that&#39;s yeah it does we have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.100" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">bumper sticker which is an attempt to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.170" end="00:14:51.310" style="s2">what we call honest marketing and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:55.260" style="s2">bumper sticker says radical honesty it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.310" end="00:14:55.260" style="s2">works pretty good most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.640" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">that&#39;s the extent of our PR effort you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.300" end="00:15:10.120" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s like a radical honesty</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:12.330" style="s2">about radical honesty that sort of sees</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.120" end="00:15:15.880" style="s2">the limitations of radical oh yeah yeah</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.880" end="00:15:25.330" style="s2">this very compassionate philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.740" end="00:15:30.600" style="s2">called fuck them if they can&#39;t take a</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:42.610" style="s2">I call it customer service that&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.180" end="00:15:44.590" style="s2">different it&#39;s like I see it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.610" end="00:15:46.840" style="s2">the customer&#39;s always right and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.590" end="00:15:50.020" style="s2">is the customer and you know I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.840" end="00:15:52.600" style="s2">constantly being nice and agreeing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.020" end="00:15:57.090" style="s2">people pleasing her and in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.600" end="00:16:02.400" style="s2">radical honesty would really offend my</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.090" end="00:16:08.200" style="s2">Canadian waspy culture and and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.400" end="00:16:10.510" style="s2">desire it but I&#39;m afraid good if you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.200" end="00:16:13.510" style="s2">that to a group of people who are even</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.510" end="00:16:15.910" style="s2">waspy they will know what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.510" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">right and you know they&#39;ll know what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.910" end="00:16:21.000" style="s2">mean because you&#39;ve been doing it too</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:25.270" style="s2">and you know that there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.000" end="00:16:27.250" style="s2">constraint on you that&#39;s there day and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.270" end="00:16:30.010" style="s2">night all throughout your whole life</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:32.620" style="s2">which you don&#39;t really like you would</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.010" end="00:16:36.520" style="s2">rather have the more unconstrained kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.620" end="00:16:38.770" style="s2">of like childlike innocence that allows</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.520" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">you to say I don&#39;t know when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.770" end="00:16:45.700" style="s2">know or no I don&#39;t want to do that for</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">I&#39;m mad at you or it&#39;s things like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.700" end="00:16:48.010" style="s2">like now to hell with you I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.620" end="00:16:52.269" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.010" end="00:16:54.100" style="s2">oh my god that&#39;s terrible but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.269" end="00:16:55.649" style="s2">so bad it&#39;s the beginning of an honest</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.100" end="00:16:59.140" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.649" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">mm-hmm-hmm like the theory behind it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.140" end="00:17:04.449" style="s2">so clear I guess what I&#39;m seeing is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:06.900" style="s2">wondering if people like me and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.449" end="00:17:09.790" style="s2">people getting started need a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.900" end="00:17:12.040" style="s2">entryway like a kick in the pants it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.790" end="00:17:14.709" style="s2">like you want they just what&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.040" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">that gets the ball rolling so that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.709" end="00:17:23.110" style="s2">can do it or is it really just just</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:24.790" style="s2">fucking do it well what people usually</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.110" end="00:17:28.390" style="s2">complain about is the fact that it may</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.790" end="00:17:30.580" style="s2">be confrontational or offensive but</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.390" end="00:17:34.210" style="s2">what&#39;s most scary about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.580" end="00:17:36.250" style="s2">you&#39;re vulnerable when you do that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.210" end="00:17:38.620" style="s2">open up it&#39;s kind of instead of having</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.250" end="00:17:41.320" style="s2">your life oriented around defending</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.620" end="00:17:45.160" style="s2">yourself or your reputation in the minds</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.320" end="00:17:47.530" style="s2">of other people you say you you&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.160" end="00:17:50.200" style="s2">reputation in your mind it may be good</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.530" end="00:17:52.150" style="s2">or bad that&#39;s not the main thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.200" end="00:17:55.000" style="s2">going for what I&#39;m going for is telling</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.150" end="00:17:57.100" style="s2">you what I appreciate what I resent what</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.000" end="00:18:00.010" style="s2">I like what I don&#39;t like what I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.100" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">in the world rather than and whether I</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.010" end="00:18:05.080" style="s2">like you or don&#39;t like you whether I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:06.970" style="s2">want you like me or not like me then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.080" end="00:18:09.400" style="s2">going to talk about that I&#39;m gonna go a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.970" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">cut deeper I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.400" end="00:18:14.830" style="s2">for me what I noticed going through my</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:18.040" style="s2">mind is what I notice in my sensations</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.830" end="00:18:22.300" style="s2">in my body and what I notice about you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.040" end="00:18:25.240" style="s2">and so that when you&#39;re talking to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.300" end="00:18:28.179" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a dangerous thing because</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.240" end="00:18:30.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit threatening to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.179" end="00:18:34.090" style="s2">usual role playing it&#39;s more intimate</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.610" end="00:18:36.340" style="s2">than people are used to tolerating</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">do you find that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.340" end="00:18:42.590" style="s2">techniques aside from just being really</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:44.330" style="s2">honest to help invite that person to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.590" end="00:18:46.040" style="s2">join you at that level because I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.330" end="00:18:49.820" style="s2">my fear is that I&#39;ll be honest and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.040" end="00:18:52.040" style="s2">person will just be like you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.820" end="00:18:57.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m like I want to know I want</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.040" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">to see you as well I want some gravy</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.500" end="00:19:01.640" style="s2">here on the vulnerability front I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:03.680" style="s2">well then your next step it honestly to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.640" end="00:19:11.060" style="s2">be my imagining is that you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.680" end="00:19:14.390" style="s2">completely and there&#39;s always there</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.060" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">there if the answer is my question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.390" end="00:19:21.770" style="s2">like just right say it exactly that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:23.930" style="s2">you got alright you&#39;re on the first rung</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.770" end="00:19:28.520" style="s2">that three more years she could be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.930" end="00:19:31.250" style="s2">radical honesty trainer I I hope to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.520" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">that in a de-facto way at very many all</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.250" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">right good I mean the topic that I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:39.170" style="s2">the most fascinated by as many people</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:43.010" style="s2">here already know is is shame and when I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.170" end="00:19:45.290" style="s2">think of shame it&#39;s a moderator it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.010" end="00:19:47.450" style="s2">like my I&#39;ve got my honesty and my truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.290" end="00:19:49.160" style="s2">and then shame comes in and completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.450" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">moderates it all as to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.160" end="00:19:54.940" style="s2">appropriate what&#39;s good what&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna help what&#39;s gonna hurt and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.940" end="00:20:02.920" style="s2">it seems to me like shame is a is the if</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">if not one of the biggest kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.920" end="00:20:10.330" style="s2">barriers to radical honesty I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:10.330" style="s2">that&#39;s something that resonates with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.500" end="00:20:17.640" style="s2">it resonates quite a bit yes the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.570" end="00:20:17.640" style="s2">is that what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.540" end="00:20:25.780" style="s2">allow some limited set of sensations</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.930" end="00:20:28.300" style="s2">which at the base level shame is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.780" end="00:20:30.130" style="s2">sensation based do you feel something in</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.300" end="00:20:34.120" style="s2">your bodies is increase of heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.130" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">your blush mm-hmm and flush in the front</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.120" end="00:20:39.040" style="s2">of your chest and your face and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:41.560" style="s2">warmth and your body and place is</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.040" end="00:20:44.020" style="s2">different you do and you want to use</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.560" end="00:20:47.770" style="s2">turn away and not be in the spotlight of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.020" end="00:20:49.570" style="s2">attention and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.770" end="00:20:51.880" style="s2">we work with with people is that when</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.570" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">you are willing to experience an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.880" end="00:20:58.230" style="s2">experience it comes and goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:21:01.720" style="s2">but when you resist an experience it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.230" end="00:21:05.800" style="s2">persists yeah and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.720" end="00:21:08.200" style="s2">causes the resistance of the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.800" end="00:21:12.520" style="s2">of shame is that people resist being</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.200" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">ashamed and and you can just say well</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.520" end="00:21:18.090" style="s2">I&#39;m feel warmth in my face and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:20.380" style="s2">my face is red and I guess mine</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.090" end="00:21:25.870" style="s2">imagining is that I&#39;m ashamed of what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.380" end="00:21:28.150" style="s2">just said to you and I feel skirted like</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.870" end="00:21:31.150" style="s2">I want to twitch around and move around</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.150" end="00:21:33.490" style="s2">in you stay with that experience and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.150" end="00:21:36.790" style="s2">every single second you stay with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.490" end="00:21:40.200" style="s2">longer like extra 10 seconds with it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.790" end="00:21:45.640" style="s2">find that is just a bunch of sensations</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.200" end="00:21:48.190" style="s2">uh-huh and that what we say another one</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.640" end="00:21:50.530" style="s2">of our sneakers is life is just</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.190" end="00:21:51.820" style="s2">sensational when life is just</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.530" end="00:21:55.690" style="s2">sensational</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.820" end="00:21:59.340" style="s2">and what happens is if you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.690" end="00:22:01.690" style="s2">be completely naked and bare-assed</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.340" end="00:22:03.370" style="s2">exposed one of the things we do in the a</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.270" end="00:24:35.320" style="s2">is have you ever pushed radical honesty</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">it go and sometimes they&#39;re triggered</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:57.320" style="s2">the anger and to resent me for what I</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.320" end="00:25:02.840" style="s2">cry they feel sad and to stay with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.560" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">experience the whole point of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.840" end="00:25:09.560" style="s2">rat Agosti covers a multitude of sins</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:12.740" style="s2">but the purpose of the sins is to not</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.560" end="00:25:14.900" style="s2">have them the avoidance of such things</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.740" end="00:25:17.510" style="s2">that are triggered in you from what</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.900" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">happened to you earlier in your life to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.510" end="00:25:22.390" style="s2">have that not be the theme of your life</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:26.900" style="s2">that you can actually design and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.390" end="00:25:30.500" style="s2">influence what your life is about only</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.900" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">if you are able to inhibit just being</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.500" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">run by triggers there&#39;s something gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">triggered and so you behave a certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:39.530" style="s2">way because you learned how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.820" end="00:25:41.750" style="s2">when you were five and a half or a nine</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.530" end="00:25:43.790" style="s2">or something like that and you just</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.750" end="00:25:46.340" style="s2">reenact that without any consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.790" end="00:25:48.020" style="s2">yeah and what happens when people start</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.340" end="00:25:51.080" style="s2">sharing other people are honest with</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.020" end="00:25:54.170" style="s2">them and people end up being moved with</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.080" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">each other so they people cry a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.170" end="00:26:03.020" style="s2">these groups I cry a lot I&#39;m a big sissy</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:09.620" style="s2">and they jab me better at all time it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.020" end="00:26:11.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t bother me but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.620" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">you have the experiences that you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.810" end="00:26:16.250" style="s2">and you live them out loud and you share</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:18.170" style="s2">them with other people and so when</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.250" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">you&#39;re vulnerable you&#39;re vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.170" end="00:26:23.240" style="s2">when you&#39;re angry you&#39;re angry and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:26.300" style="s2">get angry and you tell you get over it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.240" end="00:26:28.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take about 90 seconds mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.300" end="00:26:31.640" style="s2">you get hurt and you get over it and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.730" end="00:26:33.740" style="s2">you you have some kind of a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.640" end="00:26:35.930" style="s2">saying to somebody that&#39;s okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.740" end="00:26:39.310" style="s2">hurt my feelings I&#39;ll be hurt and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.930" end="00:26:41.690" style="s2">get over it instead of like staying</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.310" end="00:26:43.880" style="s2">alienated from you for 20 years because</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.690" end="00:26:47.900" style="s2">you hurt my feelings I&#39;m there back here</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.880" end="00:26:50.900" style="s2">in 1993 there does seem to be something</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.900" end="00:26:52.760" style="s2">powerful about you you need someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.900" end="00:26:55.070" style="s2">there to be honest too</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.760" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it seems important as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.070" end="00:26:59.940" style="s2">said to stay with the person to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:03.740" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m angry yeah I&#39;m pissed off yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.940" end="00:27:06.840" style="s2">you&#39;re angry but let&#39;s stay in community</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.740" end="00:27:09.510" style="s2">until we&#39;re back to a kind of connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.840" end="00:27:13.320" style="s2">or equilibria exactly yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.510" end="00:27:14.790" style="s2">also be more and more specific so it may</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.320" end="00:27:16.740" style="s2">start out just well you&#39;re an asshole</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.790" end="00:27:19.320" style="s2">and I don&#39;t like you that&#39;s good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.740" end="00:27:21.540" style="s2">better nothing but then we try to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.320" end="00:27:23.640" style="s2">down to the eggs I resent you for saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.540" end="00:27:25.470" style="s2">I should read that book I don&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.640" end="00:27:28.590" style="s2">that goddamn book I tried to read it I</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.470" end="00:27:31.140" style="s2">resent you for saying that good some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.590" end="00:27:34.530" style="s2">your smaller but petty or resentment</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.140" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">started coming out it turns out after</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.530" end="00:27:37.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve been at night they were shopping</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:41.480" style="s2">everybody has to admit that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.740" end="00:27:45.030" style="s2">petty we&#39;re all just petty little</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.480" end="00:27:50.430" style="s2">nitpicking little nasty little bitches</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.030" end="00:27:53.180" style="s2">and bastards and and and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.430" end="00:27:56.370" style="s2">pretty funny because when it&#39;s shared</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.180" end="00:27:58.770" style="s2">you know you mean you actually got up</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.370" end="00:28:00.620" style="s2">and left Thanksgiving and didn&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.770" end="00:28:03.300" style="s2">nicely dinner anymore just because</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.620" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">someone quit therefore down too hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.300" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">when they were mad yes I did well your</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.200" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">whole life is run by this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.940" end="00:28:15.410" style="s2">reactions then I guess mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:17.790" style="s2">occurring to me that self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.410" end="00:28:21.420" style="s2">obviously has to be a big piece of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.790" end="00:28:22.740" style="s2">puzzle be in order to be able to like</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.420" end="00:28:24.510" style="s2">I&#39;m assuming you want to take those</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.740" end="00:28:26.850" style="s2">triggers and put them into your</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.510" end="00:28:30.450" style="s2">consciousness by saying I&#39;m noticing a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.850" end="00:28:34.050" style="s2">trigger I&#39;m noticing of this but for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.450" end="00:28:36.270" style="s2">lot of people it&#39;s really hard to decide</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.050" end="00:28:39.320" style="s2">enta fie from that is it just about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:42.660" style="s2">axis or is it is there some tools there</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.320" end="00:28:45.420" style="s2">well it is hard to dissident if I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.660" end="00:28:48.210" style="s2">that but it&#39;s also very rewarding to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.420" end="00:28:51.270" style="s2">over things like like when you used to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.210" end="00:28:54.030" style="s2">be afraid to say the boss no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.270" end="00:28:56.280" style="s2">want to do that and you say to the boss</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.030" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">to the first time no I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.280" end="00:29:05.070" style="s2">that and resent you for every goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:07.580" style="s2">time you ask me to do it to know you had</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.070" end="00:29:10.950" style="s2">that in you and you say I didn&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.580" end="00:29:11.460" style="s2">and what happens is there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.950" end="00:29:13.950" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.460" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">conversation do you find that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.950" end="00:29:19.110" style="s2">you talked about that petty resentment I</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.500" end="00:29:20.760" style="s2">I imagine there&#39;s a backlog that&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.110" end="00:29:22.440" style="s2">up and the first time you practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.760" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">radical honesty in like a situation like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.440" end="00:29:27.480" style="s2">that you kind of have to say and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:29.250" style="s2">a backlog like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.480" end="00:29:33.960" style="s2">resentment I wish I had it you know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.250" end="00:29:36.450" style="s2">want to clear the slate yeah and if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.960" end="00:29:38.850" style="s2">are open to them clearing their slate</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.450" end="00:29:42.929" style="s2">with you right then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.850" end="00:29:46.230" style="s2">relationship for both of you is changed</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.929" end="00:29:50.360" style="s2">and in a more nourishing direction where</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.230" end="00:29:55.020" style="s2">you feel heard and seen and known and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.360" end="00:29:57.750" style="s2">talked to and they do tea and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.020" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">deeper level of intimacy that I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.750" end="00:30:03.870" style="s2">we need like right now during this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:06.020" style="s2">crisis it&#39;s just you can&#39;t watch TV at</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.870" end="00:30:11.309" style="s2">night without seeing instances of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.020" end="00:30:13.260" style="s2">there&#39;s this new strange new normal is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.309" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">going to get born here and the new</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.260" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">normal is going to require more honesty</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:24.120" style="s2">because radical honesty is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:27.059" style="s2">is becoming obvious you know whenever an</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.640" end="00:32:02.470" style="s2">opportunities for one-sided honesty</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.250" end="00:32:04.510" style="s2">where you do a podcast that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.470" end="00:32:08.110" style="s2">honest or you do zoom classes that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.510" end="00:32:10.150" style="s2">really honest and I have noticed that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.110" end="00:32:13.330" style="s2">creates these one-sided connections</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.150" end="00:32:15.460" style="s2">where people know almost too much about</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.330" end="00:32:17.650" style="s2">you sometimes and I feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.460" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">really connects with Ravens question so</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.970" end="00:32:30.370" style="s2">hey thank you yeah so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:33.430" style="s2">about the role of the private is there a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.370" end="00:32:38.500" style="s2">role of the private or privacy in in</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.430" end="00:32:42.970" style="s2">your framework of radical honesty or our</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.500" end="00:32:44.830" style="s2">automatic inclination is to withhold but</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.970" end="00:32:46.990" style="s2">what I say in radical honesty is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.830" end="00:32:50.890" style="s2">the most pernicious form of lying is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.990" end="00:32:53.980" style="s2">just not saying what you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.890" end="00:32:57.010" style="s2">it&#39;s being featured these days and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.980" end="00:33:00.430" style="s2">whole conversation worldwide about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.010" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">virus is have Wendy withhold information</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.430" end="00:33:07.710" style="s2">and and the the most deadly thing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:10.930" style="s2">done as a species with this virus is</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.710" end="00:33:13.230" style="s2">delay the sharing of information that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.930" end="00:33:16.180" style="s2">was available by just two or three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.230" end="00:33:23.940" style="s2">killed thousands and thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.180" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">and the the the attempt to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.940" end="00:33:31.180" style="s2">something in your imagination you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:33.730" style="s2">to preserve some people&#39;s impression of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.180" end="00:33:36.220" style="s2">you usually you want to make sure you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.730" end="00:33:39.460" style="s2">preserve a good impression in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.220" end="00:33:41.050" style="s2">of other people and what you would risk</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.460" end="00:33:45.010" style="s2">if you said well I don&#39;t know what do</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.050" end="00:33:47.140" style="s2">you think of me to them you&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.010" end="00:33:48.970" style="s2">leaving it open for them to make their</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.140" end="00:33:52.270" style="s2">own independent judgment without you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.970" end="00:33:55.180" style="s2">controlling it in some way and when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.270" end="00:34:00.040" style="s2">do that what comes from other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.180" end="00:34:02.050" style="s2">mostly is gratitude because I think well</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.040" end="00:34:03.900" style="s2">thank you for asking I&#39;m glad you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.050" end="00:34:05.740" style="s2">to know I appreciate us having the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.900" end="00:34:08.050" style="s2">conversation better rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.740" end="00:34:14.740" style="s2">trying to make a good impression and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.050" end="00:34:17.950" style="s2">then make me like you it&#39;s the reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.740" end="00:34:20.139" style="s2">that I called radical honesty sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.950" end="00:34:22.929" style="s2">overall rubric is because when you keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.139" end="00:34:26.050" style="s2">being honest you&#39;re honest about how</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.929" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">you&#39;re honest the last time and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.050" end="00:34:30.460" style="s2">honest about what their reaction was</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:32.350" style="s2">last time and then you start being</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.460" end="00:34:35.260" style="s2">honest about what you didn&#39;t be honest</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.350" end="00:34:35.659" style="s2">about the last time and then what</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.260" end="00:34:38.750" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.659" end="00:34:43.129" style="s2">as you feel mostly gratitude because</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.750" end="00:34:46.879" style="s2">you&#39;re known by them and you know them</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.129" end="00:34:49.039" style="s2">and you accept and value each other and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that they con you into</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.039" end="00:34:55.849" style="s2">liking you it&#39;s that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:57.980" style="s2">appreciate you for what you are actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.849" end="00:35:00.589" style="s2">like and what you actually said it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:02.470" style="s2">and that&#39;s much more nurturing than just</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.589" end="00:35:05.470" style="s2">getting an applause for them for</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.470" end="00:35:05.470" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.089" end="00:35:13.640" style="s2">Reno I really like your second question</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.609" end="00:35:16.210" style="s2">about the life experiences the writing</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.640" end="00:35:16.210" style="s2">why don&#39;t you ask that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.950" end="00:35:25.230" style="s2">hey thank you so my question was it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.250" end="00:35:28.200" style="s2">understanding that the writing process</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.230" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">becomes a sort of therapeutic process</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.200" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">for authors and what I wanted to know is</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:36.800" style="s2">what you&#39;ve learnt about yourself while</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:41.250" style="s2">writing radical honesty</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.800" end="00:35:47.369" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.250" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">answer I had a moment when I was writing</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.369" end="00:35:53.220" style="s2">the book radical I see about the middle</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:56.250" style="s2">of it I realized that I hadn&#39;t said why</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.220" end="00:35:59.650" style="s2">I was writing that book</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.250" end="00:36:01.390" style="s2">and it was a background motivating force</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.650" end="00:36:03.010" style="s2">for me but I wasn&#39;t sure he was people</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.390" end="00:36:04.510" style="s2">so just started writing the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.010" end="00:36:06.610" style="s2">writing this book I want to build my</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.510" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">reputation in the minds of other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.610" end="00:36:10.540" style="s2">I want to become famous you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.440" end="00:36:13.270" style="s2">people think I&#39;m smart and a wise man</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.540" end="00:36:15.820" style="s2">and to buy my books and give me praise</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.270" end="00:36:19.240" style="s2">and give me a lot of money I&#39;m greedy</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.820" end="00:36:21.190" style="s2">and I won&#39;t have that so I went on until</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.240" end="00:36:23.530" style="s2">I got tired of it that I hated it a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.190" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">little bit but I left it the book and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.530" end="00:36:27.150" style="s2">turned out that lots and lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:31.270" style="s2">when they got that part of the book</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.150" end="00:36:33.640" style="s2">wrote me letters and have it since then</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.270" end="00:36:35.830" style="s2">like send emails and lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.640" end="00:36:38.260" style="s2">things they really appreciated that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.830" end="00:36:40.180" style="s2">just sort of stumbled onto that and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.260" end="00:36:42.550" style="s2">went ahead in the laboratory then that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.180" end="00:36:45.460" style="s2">was in the book because I was being</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.550" end="00:36:49.180" style="s2">honest about wanting to get attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.460" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">and be famous and to have an impact and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.180" end="00:36:57.580" style="s2">I wanted to help people I have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:59.320" style="s2">themes of helping people and I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.580" end="00:37:02.109" style="s2">helped a lot of people I think and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.320" end="00:37:04.090" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what I learned to do so</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.109" end="00:37:07.960" style="s2">every now and then when I&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.090" end="00:37:12.359" style="s2">something goes across like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.960" end="00:37:12.359" style="s2">just say whatever it is as best I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.220" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">so that my performance for me is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.110" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">perform not performing thank you wow</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.380" end="00:37:33.130" style="s2">that last line you just said Brad about</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.060" end="00:37:34.300" style="s2">performing not performing brings up</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.130" end="00:37:37.570" style="s2">something that Peter and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.300" end="00:37:41.380" style="s2">discussing about when we&#39;re trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.570" end="00:37:44.110" style="s2">authentic is it authentic or is it more</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.380" end="00:37:46.600" style="s2">like our best approximation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.110" end="00:37:48.100" style="s2">authenticity our best approximation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.600" end="00:37:49.660" style="s2">noticing you know what I mean like is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.100" end="00:37:51.580" style="s2">there is there some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.660" end="00:37:55.720" style="s2">performance but it&#39;s like a performance</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.580" end="00:37:58.870" style="s2">rooted as hard as you can in reality no</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.720" end="00:38:01.390" style="s2">we&#39;re good we&#39;re we&#39;re not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.870" end="00:38:03.160" style="s2">anti perfectionism but we&#39;re against it</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.390" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">I have this saying I ask people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.160" end="00:38:09.940" style="s2">recite anything worth doing is worth</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.130" end="00:39:33.690" style="s2">honor to talk to you briefly here well I</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.520" end="00:39:35.670" style="s2">remember one of the things I remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.690" end="00:39:37.410" style="s2">about our conversation was how you were</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.670" end="00:39:40.020" style="s2">making kind of fun of yourself that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.410" end="00:39:43.260" style="s2">liked pot and alcohol a little too much</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.020" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">and through many of my years including</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.260" end="00:39:51.299" style="s2">myself I love pot I really love it</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:52.890" style="s2">but for some reason there&#39;s just like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.299" end="00:39:55.369" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s been an underlying</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.890" end="00:39:57.450" style="s2">guilt that bubbles up around that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.369" end="00:39:58.890" style="s2">especially if I had a really good time</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.450" end="00:40:00.569" style="s2">like if I smoked pot and had the best</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.890" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">time ever then like was it because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.569" end="00:40:06.030" style="s2">pot or something around there mmm and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:07.380" style="s2">really believe I mean including per zone</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:10.230" style="s2">because I think person I went completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.380" end="00:40:12.540" style="s2">sober that I&#39;ve only started that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.230" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">like is that the only way to not feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.540" end="00:40:16.109" style="s2">guilty about these substances is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:18.660" style="s2">completely quit them or do I just think</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.109" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">I love the guilt more and my question to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.660" end="00:40:23.609" style="s2">you is can you relate and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:26.450" style="s2">kind of figured a way to be in more</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.609" end="00:40:30.180" style="s2">harmony with those substances yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.450" end="00:40:31.559" style="s2">hmm what I was just talking about about</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.180" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">anything worth doing is worth doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.559" end="00:40:39.299" style="s2">poorly is that what are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:42.059" style="s2">I&#39;m writing a book right now called</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.299" end="00:40:44.430" style="s2">contact and withdrawal and it talks</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.059" end="00:40:46.650" style="s2">about that now you can be in verbal</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.430" end="00:40:48.180" style="s2">contact in physical contact and we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.650" end="00:40:49.799" style="s2">shake hands with each other yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.180" end="00:40:52.140" style="s2">speak to each other we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.799" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">different kinds of contact and then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.140" end="00:40:55.410" style="s2">can turn them and walk away from each</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:40:58.200" style="s2">other and walk out the door and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.410" end="00:41:00.450" style="s2">withdrawn and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.200" end="00:41:03.450" style="s2">trills and I used to talk about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.450" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">was having clean contact and clean</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.450" end="00:41:07.710" style="s2">withdrawal so that you can contact</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.030" end="00:41:09.980" style="s2">someone you&#39;re completely with them and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.710" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">then you go you&#39;re gone the hell away</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.980" end="00:41:19.430" style="s2">and that what are the things that I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:25.250" style="s2">about being stoned a lot of the time is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.430" end="00:41:27.500" style="s2">that I don&#39;t particularly care about how</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.250" end="00:41:29.329" style="s2">my performance is going when I&#39;m stoned</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.500" end="00:41:30.829" style="s2">I&#39;m just laughing around playing music</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.329" end="00:41:32.569" style="s2">or we&#39;re singing together or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.829" end="00:41:35.990" style="s2">like that and he gets so wrapped up in</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.569" end="00:41:37.609" style="s2">the very sensations of it now I find it</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.990" end="00:41:40.789" style="s2">to be good for that grounding and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.609" end="00:41:45.650" style="s2">sensations in the body that form of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.789" end="00:41:47.539" style="s2">grounding so I like it so I I ran for</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.650" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">Congress about eight or nine years ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.539" end="00:41:53.089" style="s2">and the reporters would ask me have you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:54.770" style="s2">ever used any illegal substances I said</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.089" end="00:41:59.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve done every illegal drug known to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.770" end="00:42:01.789" style="s2">man I would get really frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.960" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">because they had all these shocking</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.789" end="00:42:05.869" style="s2">questions and I know the answer to I</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:08.420" style="s2">made it I sort of you know I&#39;d shut up</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.869" end="00:42:12.020" style="s2">here when I&#39;d done all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.420" end="00:42:13.849" style="s2">I talked about them not with that shame</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.020" end="00:42:18.410" style="s2">and they just became bored and walked</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.849" end="00:42:22.460" style="s2">off and the thing is that if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.410" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">have to hide something if it&#39;s not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.460" end="00:42:29.510" style="s2">thing if you&#39;re it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:31.309" style="s2">shame is running for you that now and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.510" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">then you might get stoned but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.309" end="00:42:35.690" style="s2">gonna be like a STONER where you smoke</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:37.039" style="s2">at every damn day or something and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.690" end="00:42:39.079" style="s2">might have a drink down there but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.039" end="00:42:40.940" style="s2">not gonna be drunk all the time you</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.079" end="00:42:42.650" style="s2">might get drunk once or twice a year or</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.940" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">something but not like falling down</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.650" end="00:42:49.819" style="s2">drunk like a teenager or something but</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:51.710" style="s2">you might have a drink and total joint</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.819" end="00:42:54.349" style="s2">and then it might not do it for a week</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.710" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">that&#39;s what I look for something where</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.349" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not like basically being trapped by</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:01.220" style="s2">it because you have to avoid it because</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:04.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad thing or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.220" end="00:43:08.390" style="s2">freedom means you can do or not do</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.460" end="00:43:11.569" style="s2">something and that each new moment of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.390" end="00:43:14.900" style="s2">freedom is a new opportunity so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.569" end="00:43:17.779" style="s2">could say well I&#39;ve I&#39;ve had like a year</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.900" end="00:43:20.270" style="s2">of sobriety and I&#39;ll ask you about what</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.779" end="00:43:22.849" style="s2">the story was and did you what you do</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.270" end="00:43:24.950" style="s2">beforehand and do you not do you need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.849" end="00:43:27.890" style="s2">stay in a a and by the estimation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.950" end="00:43:29.910" style="s2">your estimation and some people do and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.890" end="00:43:34.299" style="s2">some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.910" end="00:43:36.910" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m my main value in this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.299" end="00:43:39.339" style="s2">freedom it&#39;s freedom to make mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.910" end="00:43:43.599" style="s2">they&#39;re not so bad they kill you or hurt</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.339" end="00:43:45.549" style="s2">somebody else and if you can moderate</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.599" end="00:43:47.049" style="s2">them so that you stay with them as their</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.549" end="00:43:50.470" style="s2">hurt they can get over it</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.049" end="00:43:53.380" style="s2">then your being a kind of presence in</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.470" end="00:43:55.809" style="s2">the world and that&#39;s what this is all</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.380" end="00:43:58.180" style="s2">about is about being able to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.809" end="00:44:01.150" style="s2">presence in the world to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.180" end="00:44:03.640" style="s2">participating in acknowledging noticing</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.150" end="00:44:05.529" style="s2">each other and to be willing to be with</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.640" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">each other and nourished by being with</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.529" end="00:44:10.839" style="s2">each other in that experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:15.220" style="s2">theater so it&#39;s not ever really a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.839" end="00:44:17.950" style="s2">question should I ever smoke pot or you</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.380" end="00:46:57.090" style="s2">connecting thing and there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.690" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">mention of non-violent communication in</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.090" end="00:47:01.260" style="s2">the chat and in fact just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:05.910" style="s2">you talk kind of reminds me of Marshall</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.260" end="00:47:07.800" style="s2">Rosenberg and I wonder in an NBC they</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.910" end="00:47:10.530" style="s2">have this concept of a liveness which</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.800" end="00:47:12.810" style="s2">sounds similar it&#39;s like when you really</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.530" end="00:47:14.150" style="s2">talk to someone honestly in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.810" end="00:47:17.010" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.150" end="00:47:19.230" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of amazing type of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.010" end="00:47:20.280" style="s2">connection and it sounds similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.230" end="00:47:22.260" style="s2">you were talking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.280" end="00:47:24.150" style="s2">Gestalt in terms of like the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:25.770" style="s2">connecting I wonder if you if that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.150" end="00:47:27.110" style="s2">sounds about the same to you and if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.770" end="00:47:34.320" style="s2">could talk a little bit more about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.110" end="00:47:35.670" style="s2">hmm well I like him and I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.320" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">prejudiced against a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.670" end="00:47:40.410" style="s2">followers because we had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:43.250" style="s2">ingratitude groups and we always have</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.410" end="00:47:49.350" style="s2">anger to deal with anger because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.250" end="00:47:52.650" style="s2">always so I don&#39;t know that it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.350" end="00:47:56.430" style="s2">me that it&#39;s a little to you moralistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.650" end="00:47:59.850" style="s2">well that yeah there&#39;s a right way to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.430" end="00:48:01.260" style="s2">nonviolent and that&#39;s you know I was in</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.810" end="00:50:15.500" style="s2">non-violent interaction but the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.780" end="00:50:18.410" style="s2">surprising part was we went back the</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.590" end="00:50:44.650" style="s2">except just when I paid him the check</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.420" end="00:50:47.330" style="s2">and he handed with a change back I</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.650" end="00:50:53.570" style="s2">looked at him and I said thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.330" end="00:50:56.990" style="s2">he said thank you and what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.570" end="00:50:59.480" style="s2">he was abused child - he&#39;s a big like</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.990" end="00:51:01.250" style="s2">six foot five sweet he could have kicked</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.480" end="00:51:04.280" style="s2">my ass I&#39;m sure but I would have</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.250" end="00:51:07.550" style="s2">absolutely gone after King is anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.280" end="00:51:10.460" style="s2">he knew it because I we were both hurt</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.550" end="00:51:12.830" style="s2">and abused children and he integrated</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.460" end="00:51:15.130" style="s2">their restaurant and it was the only</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.830" end="00:51:19.290" style="s2">integrated I stood for three</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.130" end="00:51:22.270" style="s2">and everybody tried to make him not</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.290" end="00:51:26.110" style="s2">desegregate but he was the damn main</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.270" end="00:51:30.580" style="s2">Swede and he wasn&#39;t going to let them</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.110" end="00:51:34.390" style="s2">tell him what to do and so a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.580" end="00:51:36.250" style="s2">expressions of resentment appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.390" end="00:51:37.840" style="s2">violent but I don&#39;t agree if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.250" end="00:51:39.910" style="s2">hit somebody in the face or something</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.840" end="00:51:41.500" style="s2">that&#39;s not violence as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.910" end="00:51:43.150" style="s2">concerned you&#39;d say you lowlife</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.500" end="00:51:45.820" style="s2">motherfucking son of a bitch that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.150" end="00:51:47.860" style="s2">perfectly acceptable I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.820" end="00:51:48.940" style="s2">get more particular about why there</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.860" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">isn&#39;t a bitch</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.940" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">and then get over it and say well you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:57.460" style="s2">know I&#39;m not as mad at you that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:52:00.310" style="s2">before he got over he finally he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.460" end="00:52:04.080" style="s2">ever know we were serious until I</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.310" end="00:52:06.700" style="s2">threatened to kick his ass so I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.080" end="00:52:09.340" style="s2">non-violence has to be defined as either</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.700" end="00:52:11.020" style="s2">physical violence or not cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.340" end="00:52:13.720" style="s2">like the definition of violence just</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.020" end="00:52:16.869" style="s2">using categories because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.720" end="00:52:20.650" style="s2">intimate enough and to get over</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.869" end="00:52:23.140" style="s2">mmm-hmm what that story I feel really</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.650" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">points a spotlight on the culture that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:30.849" style="s2">today and I&#39;m not sure how much you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.579" end="00:52:36.299" style="s2">your finger on that pulse but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.849" end="00:52:38.799" style="s2">real movement towards write speak and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.299" end="00:52:41.289" style="s2">you&#39;re like even in your stories the N</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.799" end="00:52:43.269" style="s2">word came up and yeah yeah when you said</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.289" end="00:52:44.619" style="s2">the word sissy I tweaked on that like</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.269" end="00:52:46.509" style="s2">part of me was like oh you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.619" end="00:52:49.150" style="s2">allowed to say sissy and I&#39;m allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.509" end="00:52:53.019" style="s2">now get offended and wondering how you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.150" end="00:52:54.999" style="s2">react to that new culture I just say</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.019" end="00:53:01.450" style="s2">that God knows I&#39;m sorry and say it</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.999" end="00:53:05.319" style="s2">again but it it&#39;s like basically I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.450" end="00:53:08.769" style="s2">self-righteous prick myself I know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.319" end="00:53:10.359" style="s2">it is to be such a righteous fool and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.769" end="00:53:13.269" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a righteous fool plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.359" end="00:53:16.599" style="s2">times and I&#39;m less righteous the older I</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.269" end="00:53:18.460" style="s2">get the less rich as I am and I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.599" end="00:53:22.420" style="s2">probably Lobby would say the less right</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.460" end="00:53:25.869" style="s2">I am but the less attached to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.420" end="00:53:27.249" style="s2">righteousness I am because of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.869" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">nourishment that comes from sharing</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.249" end="00:53:34.180" style="s2">honestly is so much more important than</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:35.400" style="s2">being able to maintain the appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.180" end="00:53:38.499" style="s2">being well behaved</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.400" end="00:53:41.859" style="s2">mm-hm it seems now the culture is so</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.499" end="00:53:44.619" style="s2">much about being right and I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.859" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">saying and I feel this especially from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.619" end="00:53:50.799" style="s2">shame standpoint that being right</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:53.259" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually connect us right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.799" end="00:53:55.779" style="s2">it does but then it makes us just</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.259" end="00:53:57.609" style="s2">Republicans or just the runners or so</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.779" end="00:54:00.989" style="s2">right it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very tribal</p>

<p begin="00:54:11.710" end="00:54:16.839" style="s2">new one obviously in the works</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.489" end="00:54:19.589" style="s2">how can people connect with your work</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.839" end="00:54:19.589" style="s2">where should we start</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.910" end="00:54:25.339" style="s2">well there a lot of exciting things</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.819" end="00:54:27.980" style="s2">going on this day we were planning for a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.339" end="00:54:30.380" style="s2">transition to building a strong online</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.980" end="00:54:31.700" style="s2">workshop over the last four years we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.380" end="00:54:33.799" style="s2">been working on it we&#39;ve put together</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.700" end="00:54:36.980" style="s2">lots of video tape from other workshops</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.799" end="00:54:39.109" style="s2">and we have designed an online course</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.980" end="00:54:42.980" style="s2">which you can find out about by going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.109" end="00:54:46.940" style="s2">radical honesty dot-com and we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.980" end="00:54:49.400" style="s2">about forty radical honesty trainers</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.940" end="00:54:52.430" style="s2">about 15 here in this country and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.400" end="00:54:55.490" style="s2">rest of them in Europe and we do</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.430" end="00:54:58.869" style="s2">workshops various places all around the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.490" end="00:55:01.789" style="s2">world at least they were interrupted now</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.869" end="00:55:03.710" style="s2">we&#39;re doing a few online workshops and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.789" end="00:55:07.190" style="s2">if you go to radical honesty calm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.710" end="00:55:10.849" style="s2">frequently changed and there&#39;s also our</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.190" end="00:55:15.279" style="s2">presences on Facebook and social media</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.849" end="00:55:19.400" style="s2">and basically you can find videotapes of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.279" end="00:55:23.720" style="s2">various obtuse and ignorant and funny</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.400" end="00:55:29.210" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve done and the view</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.720" end="00:55:33.619" style="s2">embarrassing things if you look and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.210" end="00:55:37.039" style="s2">happens is that there is this prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.619" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">in favor of laughter that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.039" end="00:55:41.539" style="s2">there is a lot of funny people and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:44.210" style="s2">part of what we assigned to people in</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.539" end="00:55:47.869" style="s2">training to be trainers is to go and do</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.210" end="00:55:49.490" style="s2">a stand-up comedy Saturday and just see</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.869" end="00:55:51.410" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to get out there and try</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.490" end="00:55:54.859" style="s2">to be funny and not have anybody laugh</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.410" end="00:55:57.130" style="s2">because that&#39;s a real examination of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.859" end="00:55:59.539" style="s2">embarrassment there mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.130" end="00:56:06.500" style="s2">why did you say that I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.539" end="00:56:09.410" style="s2">funny well it was there&#39;s no hiding in</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.500" end="00:56:10.460" style="s2">standup I love that right I assume you</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.460" end="00:56:14.630" style="s2">striptease or something that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.380" end="00:56:20.779" style="s2">no no I think it&#39;s too easy in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.630" end="00:56:23.420" style="s2">stand-up place it&#39;d be too easy well</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.779" end="00:56:26.809" style="s2">Brad this has been really refreshing and</p>
