<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">over time as we kind of get our arms</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">around it complement the other social</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">are exceeding our capacity to make</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">and we need a new one this network</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:22.110" style="s2">figure out what it can be good for and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:25.769" style="s2">what it what it is bad at it will take</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.110" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">some time the model that I&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.769" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">and that I&#39;ve you know teased out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:36.629" style="s2">what I&#39;ve seen is that this network one</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:38.670" style="s2">of the key decision-making systems that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.629" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">that&#39;s falling out of it is this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.670" end="00:02:46.530" style="s2">the consensus and dissent and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:51.470" style="s2">consensus is an agreement on a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.530" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">simple proposition and it&#39;s allows</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.470" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">society to move very quickly once it</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:03:01.109" style="s2">agrees on that proposition and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">dissent is this very similar to what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.109" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">see with you know a lot of what Trump</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">does it&#39;s always finding kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:11.849" style="s2">opposite view and trying to disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">through you know different means the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.849" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">consensus a consensus set from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:20.129" style="s2">outside appears to be detrimental to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">health and well-being of the people or</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.129" end="00:03:25.470" style="s2">dissenting so in the case of in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:28.709" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in right now with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.470" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">the pandemic we see a very clear example</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">of a consensus developing in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">you know this pandemic is bad and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">that we should eradicate it and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">developed very very quickly and then it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:46.379" style="s2">allowed the shutdown of the the entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">US economy to occur within weeks long</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.379" end="00:03:49.109" style="s2">before the government&#39;s actually even</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:51.510" style="s2">got to the point where they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.109" end="00:03:53.310" style="s2">starting to order shutdowns so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.510" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">consensus actually you know shut down</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.310" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">air travel even though there really</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">isn&#39;t any restrictions under trouble now</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:01.709" style="s2">it&#39;s done ninety six percent from where</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">it was it has shut down Commerce it</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.709" end="00:04:05.340" style="s2">changed corporate behavior you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">through pressure both demand pressure</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.340" end="00:04:10.889" style="s2">plus internal kind of social pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:15.799" style="s2">force people to or force companies to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.889" end="00:04:18.599" style="s2">opt for work at home corporate travel</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.799" end="00:04:20.729" style="s2">etc and then there now we have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.599" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">dissent is the group of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.729" end="00:04:26.909" style="s2">outside who are saying let&#39;s let&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:27.990" style="s2">up the economy now the pandemic is over</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.909" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.990" end="00:04:32.090" style="s2">that it&#39;s a lot of the information is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">faked or the goalposts are moving or</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.090" end="00:04:37.229" style="s2">that we should go through with a herd</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">immunity strategy so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.229" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">dynamic between dissent and consensus is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:45.990" style="s2">how we&#39;re making decisions now yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:48.659" style="s2">very very right yeah I love the point</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:50.970" style="s2">that you make that in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.659" end="00:04:55.289" style="s2">social distancing at least the wave</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.970" end="00:04:56.819" style="s2">started before the government acted you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.289" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">know for instance you know I read the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.819" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">signals and concluded it for myself and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">my family we were locking the fuck down</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">around the 5th of March right along</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:08.940" style="s2">great any state did it and so I was an</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:12.360" style="s2">incremental Network signal and I passed</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.940" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">that word along to my friends and and at</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.360" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">least to some degree on social media and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:21.229" style="s2">so the network itself started these</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:23.909" style="s2">parts but coalesced around a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.229" end="00:05:26.690" style="s2">and you know I might been wrong but a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.909" end="00:05:30.569" style="s2">person who had just had major surgery</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.690" end="00:05:35.069" style="s2">and is in the elevated age range it</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.569" end="00:05:37.289" style="s2">struck me as a reasonable response but</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.069" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">whether yeah totally correct response or</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.289" end="00:05:41.550" style="s2">not hard to say oh yeah I know I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">did a lot of things it did it you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.550" end="00:05:45.930" style="s2">there was a open source information</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">discovery effort I mean there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.930" end="00:05:52.919" style="s2">information flowing a torrent of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:55.259" style="s2">information flowing on the pandemic in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.919" end="00:05:56.759" style="s2">comparison kind of the black box in kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.259" end="00:06:00.419" style="s2">of the black box trickled that we got</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.759" end="00:06:02.370" style="s2">into in previous events you know and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.419" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">this information is constantly being</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:08.180" style="s2">vetted it&#39;s being torn apart reassembled</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.210" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">new strategies are being produced</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:13.469" style="s2">information is then you know turned into</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:17.159" style="s2">knowledge and and you know insight that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.469" end="00:06:19.669" style="s2">the consensus puts into play it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.159" end="00:06:21.870" style="s2">pretty pretty amazing process to watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.669" end="00:06:23.580" style="s2">you know and given that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.870" end="00:06:25.590" style="s2">truly early days I mean you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.580" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">consensus ideas stretches back to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.590" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">big open source protests that we saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:33.029" style="s2">back in you know the Arab Spring all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.110" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">way up through we saw it just recently</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.029" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">we saw it in Puerto Rico where they</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:40.469" style="s2">toppled the Governor of Puerto Rico I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:41.370" style="s2">coming together over a single idea so</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.469" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">these these</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.370" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">a contestants can mobilize very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:47.910" style="s2">quickly and they can you know undertake</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:49.979" style="s2">an incredible information discovery</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.910" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">effort and it can implement and act on</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.979" end="00:06:56.370" style="s2">that in a very complex way you know far</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:59.070" style="s2">faster I think then and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.370" end="00:07:01.620" style="s2">older traditional government can&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.070" end="00:07:02.940" style="s2">there&#39;s also a need for the dissent and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.620" end="00:07:04.889" style="s2">if you have too much dissent it seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.940" end="00:07:06.570" style="s2">chaotic in the last three years or so</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.889" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">you know with with Trump in power it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.570" end="00:07:11.729" style="s2">felt more chaotic than than stable but</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:13.530" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that we should not</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.729" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">have the dissent because the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.530" end="00:07:16.949" style="s2">can get locked in and we&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:19.320" style="s2">that out going out of this trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.949" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">out of this lockdown is that it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.320" end="00:07:22.919" style="s2">to be very hard to get people out of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:25.380" style="s2">kind of siege mentality that developed</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.919" end="00:07:28.199" style="s2">as part of this consensus and that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.380" end="00:07:30.780" style="s2">dissent is one of the keys to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.199" end="00:07:32.729" style="s2">getting us out of that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.780" end="00:07:34.740" style="s2">constantly arguing in favor of moving</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.729" end="00:07:36.030" style="s2">the economy forward but you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.740" end="00:07:37.110" style="s2">gonna have to figure out other ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.030" end="00:07:39.479" style="s2">break out of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.110" end="00:07:42.150" style="s2">this is this lock-in achieved by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.479" end="00:07:44.280" style="s2">consensus yeah that&#39;s interesting and as</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.150" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">we were chatting prior to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.280" end="00:07:48.630" style="s2">going live on the show you made the very</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:50.580" style="s2">good point that like what did you make</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.630" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">the point about the attributes of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.580" end="00:07:54.630" style="s2">particular virus and how its kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:58.320" style="s2">perhaps a challenge for Network sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.630" end="00:08:00.870" style="s2">making yeah this virus is just like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.320" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">perfectly designed instrument for you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.870" end="00:08:05.849" style="s2">know sitting astride just you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:07.950" style="s2">obvious need for a complete lockdown if</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.849" end="00:08:12.300" style="s2">it was really really truly deadly up to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.950" end="00:08:13.770" style="s2">2030 percent or you know just letting it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.300" end="00:08:16.320" style="s2">go through with with the kind of a herd</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.770" end="00:08:18.990" style="s2">immunity strategy you know it targets a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.320" end="00:08:22.620" style="s2">very specific subgroup so most people</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.990" end="00:08:25.740" style="s2">under 50 are not really impacted that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.620" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">that much and that gives a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.740" end="00:08:33.060" style="s2">false sense of kind of immunity to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">to the effects of the virus and then it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.060" end="00:08:37.169" style="s2">requires a you know incredible</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">investment a time to kind of eradicate</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.169" end="00:08:40.830" style="s2">it with it you know two weeks of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:43.709" style="s2">quarantine and the necessity of doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.830" end="00:08:45.150" style="s2">that early and what else about this I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.709" end="00:08:47.250" style="s2">had a whole brief that I wrote up on</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.150" end="00:08:48.630" style="s2">this that you know this the design of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.250" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2">this virus it makes it really really</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.630" end="00:08:54.520" style="s2">effective and then the the speed of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:56.410" style="s2">transmission is is absolutely insanely</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.520" end="00:08:59.310" style="s2">I I mean it&#39;s up in small parks</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.410" end="00:09:02.310" style="s2">territory according to some estimates</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.310" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">exceeding smallpox less than chickenpox</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.310" end="00:09:09.340" style="s2">so you can you know get out of control</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.550" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">very very easily and and zoom to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.340" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">know population scale levels yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:18.460" style="s2">makes decision-making on this very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:21.370" style="s2">hard and you were mentioning that it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.460" end="00:09:23.500" style="s2">between these two valleys they it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.370" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to see us kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.500" end="00:09:26.860" style="s2">grapple with that made that incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.690" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">hard for the government to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.860" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">decisions because it&#39;s really not clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:34.210" style="s2">exactly what strategy exit strategy or</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:36.520" style="s2">response strategy is the best do you do</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.210" end="00:09:41.650" style="s2">full quarantine where you do do do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.520" end="00:09:43.570" style="s2">do kind of a big tech testing regime to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.650" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">kind of stabilize the situation or do</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.570" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">you go with hurt immunity I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:49.530" style="s2">evaluating all three of those and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:55.720" style="s2">kind of come to a conclusion on that but</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.530" end="00:09:57.510" style="s2">we can get to that recently about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.720" end="00:10:01.900" style="s2">Swedish experiment with herd immunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.510" end="00:10:03.880" style="s2">yeah well one of the themes that we see</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.900" end="00:10:05.770" style="s2">in the in the dissent is that herd</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.880" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">immunity is probably better as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.770" end="00:10:10.270" style="s2">strategy because you know shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:13.000" style="s2">the economy for months at a time is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.270" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2">just not sustainable it&#39;s cause more</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.000" end="00:10:18.280" style="s2">damage long-term than been suffering</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:21.940" style="s2">through a couple hundred thousand dead</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.280" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">and so I went in and I looked at kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.940" end="00:10:25.480" style="s2">the exemplar of the of the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:28.210" style="s2">Sweden and I found out that they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.480" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">really very similar to what we see in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.210" end="00:10:34.960" style="s2">many states with a couple exceptions is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:36.850" style="s2">that they have not closed elementary</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.960" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">schools and activity so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.850" end="00:10:40.450" style="s2">transmission vector but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:42.670" style="s2">evidence is that the elementary school</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.450" end="00:10:45.490" style="s2">kids don&#39;t carry high viral load so it</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.670" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t as big of a vector as you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.490" end="00:10:49.900" style="s2">would get if you had universities still</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:53.230" style="s2">open and that they use let cut bars and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.900" end="00:10:55.960" style="s2">restaurants stay open but the bulk of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.230" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">the the actual mitigation of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.960" end="00:10:59.470" style="s2">is all being done but through social</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:01.330" style="s2">distancing and Sweden is really quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.470" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">good at social distancing I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.330" end="00:11:06.280" style="s2">always a joke about you know I saw</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:08.050" style="s2">pretty interesting a joke about that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.280" end="00:11:09.820" style="s2">that if you want to really experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.050" end="00:11:12.339" style="s2">loneliness you know standing a bus line</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.820" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">in Sweden because everyone six to seven</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.339" end="00:11:19.060" style="s2">feet away from each other but I started</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:21.100" style="s2">looking at you know what the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.060" end="00:11:22.810" style="s2">just letting this roll through the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.100" end="00:11:25.089" style="s2">population and assuming that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.810" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">using social distancing and in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.089" end="00:11:30.130" style="s2">selective government efforts to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:33.100" style="s2">mitigate the effects to keep the level</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.130" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">of people who are sick below the level</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.100" end="00:11:38.529" style="s2">of the capacity of the health system</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">because and the strategy and the herd</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.529" end="00:11:41.769" style="s2">immunity strategy is that you as long as</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:43.709" style="s2">you can care for these people</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.769" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">effectively is in the health care system</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.709" end="00:11:48.070" style="s2">you&#39;ll let it run as hot as possible for</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">as long as possible until you achieve</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.070" end="00:11:52.269" style="s2">her an immunity status and what that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:55.269" style="s2">means is typically for something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.269" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">the respiratory virus that&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.269" end="00:11:58.329" style="s2">transmissible somewhere between eighty</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:00.070" style="s2">and ninety five percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.329" end="00:12:01.540" style="s2">population has to get it and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.070" end="00:12:03.880" style="s2">recover from it and have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.540" end="00:12:07.630" style="s2">internal immunity and evidence suggests</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.880" end="00:12:10.709" style="s2">that there is you do get him become</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.630" end="00:12:14.020" style="s2">immune if you recover from it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.709" end="00:12:16.690" style="s2">now that strategy and as I looked around</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.020" end="00:12:20.290" style="s2">the world and found out or found where</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.690" end="00:12:23.170" style="s2">the virus is having the most impact is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.290" end="00:12:25.720" style="s2">that it works and it probably will work</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.170" end="00:12:27.880" style="s2">in relatively young countries and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.720" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">with their median age of less than</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.880" end="00:12:34.149" style="s2">thirty and that it proves to be deadly</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:37.390" style="s2">in countries where the median age is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.149" end="00:12:39.310" style="s2">greater than thirty and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.390" end="00:12:42.690" style="s2">places where the virus is having that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.310" end="00:12:45.010" style="s2">most deleterious impact is it in the old</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.690" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">developed countries you know old sick</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.010" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">developed countries the fragile</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:51.220" style="s2">countries of you know China and the US</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:55.240" style="s2">and Europe</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.220" end="00:12:59.550" style="s2">you know median age is 38 38 and 42 and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.240" end="00:13:03.370" style="s2">EU a lot of really really old</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.550" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">populations are and what the virus did</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.370" end="00:13:06.220" style="s2">is it turned our health care system</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:08.730" style="s2">witches are you know considered our</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.220" end="00:13:13.329" style="s2">strength and one of our key strengths</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.730" end="00:13:18.130" style="s2">into a weakness weakness so so big that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.329" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">it made us fragile it you know allowed</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.130" end="00:13:21.699" style="s2">us to keep a lot of people alive longer</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:24.100" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.699" end="00:13:26.230" style="s2">accumulated chronic conditions so in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">u.s. we have upwards of 45% of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.230" end="00:13:29.799" style="s2">population has least one chronic</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:33.220" style="s2">condition that they&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.799" end="00:13:37.419" style="s2">according to the CDC so in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.220" end="00:13:39.639" style="s2">population old and sick when you start</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.419" end="00:13:42.999" style="s2">to get to try to get to the 80 to 95</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.639" end="00:13:44.139" style="s2">percent immunity level required for</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.139" end="00:13:50.109" style="s2">it gets really deadly very quickly so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:52.239" style="s2">did the calculations on what it would</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.109" end="00:13:55.209" style="s2">require best case to the United States</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.239" end="00:13:57.309" style="s2">is that we have upwards of two to two</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.209" end="00:13:59.919" style="s2">and a half million people would die from</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.309" end="00:14:02.529" style="s2">the virus in order to achieve herd</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.919" end="00:14:05.259" style="s2">immunity because it would have to impact</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.529" end="00:14:08.649" style="s2">the at-risk populations in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.259" end="00:14:10.749" style="s2">achieve it that would be running the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.649" end="00:14:13.389" style="s2">current levels at five to fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.749" end="00:14:15.609" style="s2">thousand people a day dead for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.389" end="00:14:18.239" style="s2">hundred days yeah that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.609" end="00:14:20.139" style="s2">happen that&#39;s politically not palatable</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.239" end="00:14:21.939" style="s2">even and the other course even though</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.139" end="00:14:25.119" style="s2">people point out some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.939" end="00:14:27.039" style="s2">hardcore herd immunity people that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.119" end="00:14:29.769" style="s2">actual number of lost productive years</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.039" end="00:14:32.669" style="s2">will be surprisingly small because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.769" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">typical person who actually dies is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.669" end="00:14:39.749" style="s2">78 years old and has an estimated two</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:41.679" style="s2">years of life left nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.749" end="00:14:43.720" style="s2">politically and from a humanitarian</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.679" end="00:14:45.730" style="s2">perspective that just isn&#39;t gonna fly at</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.720" end="00:14:48.789" style="s2">all particularly if the alternative is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.730" end="00:14:52.569" style="s2">something you know in the 200,000 deaths</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.789" end="00:14:54.999" style="s2">range so so yeah I think I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.569" end="00:14:57.429" style="s2">you so my intuition was correct to act</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.999" end="00:14:59.769" style="s2">as if lockdown was the right strategy</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.429" end="00:15:01.899" style="s2">that&#39;s good to hear yeah I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.769" end="00:15:04.929" style="s2">places like India in the population over</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.899" end="00:15:07.089" style="s2">65 is 6 percent it&#39;s tiny you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.929" end="00:15:10.209" style="s2">herd immunity is possibly it will burn</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.089" end="00:15:13.329" style="s2">itself out you know go our Oh less than</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.209" end="00:15:14.859" style="s2">1 pretty quickly because I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.329" end="00:15:16.269" style="s2">just so many young people that it runs</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.859" end="00:15:19.509" style="s2">into that it doesn&#39;t really have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.269" end="00:15:21.069" style="s2">impact that life expectancy is short</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.509" end="00:15:24.939" style="s2">there so the number of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.069" end="00:15:28.299" style="s2">80 with compounded complicating factors</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.939" end="00:15:29.619" style="s2">is small too right so and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.299" end="00:15:32.230" style="s2">where the real death that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.619" end="00:15:35.079" style="s2">real harvest comes late seventies onward</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.230" end="00:15:35.649" style="s2">with complications oh yeah the way I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.079" end="00:15:38.350" style="s2">just looked</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.649" end="00:15:42.759" style="s2">by the internet the median age in Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.350" end="00:15:44.709" style="s2">is 41.1 so probably not a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.759" end="00:15:46.689" style="s2">be running the herd immunity experiment</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.709" end="00:15:48.519" style="s2">correct unless you are unless you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.689" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">little fascist you&#39;re trying to cleanse</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.519" end="00:15:53.259" style="s2">the body the National body and make get</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:55.899" style="s2">to make it a little bit stronger no with</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.259" end="00:15:57.399" style="s2">less less deadweight but that&#39;s the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.899" end="00:15:59.079" style="s2">I&#39;d like in Germany for instance you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.399" end="00:16:00.819" style="s2">know forty i think forty eight percent</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.079" end="00:16:05.949" style="s2">of the people that have died or over</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.819" end="00:16:08.519" style="s2">eighty that&#39;s typical x78 is the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.949" end="00:16:11.559" style="s2">guesstimate of in the West at where the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.519" end="00:16:13.779" style="s2">average age of tau all these will be</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.559" end="00:16:15.339" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.779" end="00:16:17.980" style="s2">you know the strength gets turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.339" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">weakness you know and it makes herd</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.980" end="00:16:21.670" style="s2">immunity impossible which is usually you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:23.369" style="s2">know at a gut level this is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.670" end="00:16:26.110" style="s2">the way we&#39;ve handled respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.369" end="00:16:30.129" style="s2">pandemics in the past you know we&#39;ve let</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.110" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">herd immunity take care of it because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.129" end="00:16:35.290" style="s2">were younger and healthier in it and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:37.119" style="s2">you know allowed us to do so but yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.290" end="00:16:38.649" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work now that the quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.119" end="00:16:39.610" style="s2">strategy that china file it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.649" end="00:16:42.519" style="s2">really work either</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.610" end="00:16:44.709" style="s2">i mean because it&#39;s just so deleterious</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.519" end="00:16:46.420" style="s2">there it&#39;s so negative in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.709" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">impact on the economy and you keep that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.420" end="00:16:50.679" style="s2">fragility in place even though you kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:52.420" style="s2">of externalize the quarantine meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.679" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">that if you can eradicate it internally</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.420" end="00:16:56.139" style="s2">then you have to shut down your borders</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:58.749" style="s2">in order to prevent any any new virus</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.139" end="00:17:01.689" style="s2">from you know entering back in already</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.749" end="00:17:03.189" style="s2">the chinese have you lost what they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.689" end="00:17:05.890" style="s2">ruining at a negative seven percent</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.189" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">according to this morning&#39;s figures for</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.890" end="00:17:08.919" style="s2">their economy so the first time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">gone negative in fifty years according</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.919" end="00:17:14.409" style="s2">to chinese stats the ours is likely to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:16.059" style="s2">go down minus thirty probably by the end</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.409" end="00:17:18.100" style="s2">of the second quarters that put that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.059" end="00:17:20.169" style="s2">comparison yeah i think they&#39;re i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.100" end="00:17:21.730" style="s2">they were you know this is chinese stats</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.169" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">right and they increase their death toll</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.730" end="00:17:27.429" style="s2">by fifty percent too but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:29.529" style="s2">still you know radically understating</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.429" end="00:17:31.059" style="s2">the actual negative impact but it you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.529" end="00:17:33.370" style="s2">know quarantine strategy really is in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.059" end="00:17:35.230" style="s2">good long-term strategies particularly</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.370" end="00:17:37.539" style="s2">if we don&#39;t develop a vaccine or</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.230" end="00:17:39.909" style="s2">effective treatment for a corona virus</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.539" end="00:17:41.380" style="s2">this is kind of like yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.909" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">you know solving the common cold to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.380" end="00:17:47.860" style="s2">certain extent we haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:49.750" style="s2">do that for years and ever really end</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:51.490" style="s2">we may not get that with this so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.750" end="00:17:52.990" style="s2">leaves only one strategy left and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.490" end="00:17:56.260" style="s2">is the one I&#39;m working on today is a I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.990" end="00:17:57.730" style="s2">call it the big tech solution and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.260" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">reason I call it big tech is that is you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.730" end="00:18:02.530" style="s2">know kind of a testing case tracking</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.360" style="s2">monitoring solution but the only way you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.530" end="00:18:06.850" style="s2">scale it particularly to a population as</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.360" end="00:18:10.510" style="s2">big as we have in the u.s. is through</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.850" end="00:18:11.620" style="s2">tech and the key think to that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.510" end="00:18:13.420" style="s2">cornerstone to that the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.620" end="00:18:15.070" style="s2">actually could turn our population</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.420" end="00:18:16.900" style="s2">making it&#39;s like adding a network</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.070" end="00:18:19.540" style="s2">decision making system kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.900" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">the consensus and articulating it with</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.540" end="00:18:24.460" style="s2">technology and then saying okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.940" end="00:18:26.410" style="s2">turn our population into something smart</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.460" end="00:18:29.080" style="s2">enough that this virus this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.410" end="00:18:33.370" style="s2">isn&#39;t a problem anymore I mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.080" end="00:18:35.890" style="s2">an annoyance and to do that you would</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.370" end="00:18:39.820" style="s2">need to do in-home medical monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.890" end="00:18:41.650" style="s2">use the smartphones from honoring you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.820" end="00:18:45.580" style="s2">know a lot of big data and individual</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.650" end="00:18:47.169" style="s2">decision making systems built-in to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.580" end="00:18:49.630" style="s2">control of the information environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.169" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">regarding health regarding a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.630" end="00:18:56.049" style="s2">transmission of a virus in this virus</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">and and combine that with state level</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.049" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">hiring of case trackers and people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:06.190" style="s2">handle the monitoring and etc etc but</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">that kind of effort could pull off a you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.190" end="00:19:12.510" style="s2">know a long term solution that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:14.530" style="s2">allows us to operate as if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.510" end="00:19:16.360" style="s2">weren&#39;t even threatened by the virus</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.530" end="00:19:18.610" style="s2">anymore weren&#39;t even threatened by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.360" end="00:19:22.270" style="s2">pandemic but the big problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.610" end="00:19:25.480" style="s2">obviously is that the we have almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.270" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">zero trust in any effort to aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.480" end="00:19:28.660" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:30.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve lost that trust funny I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.660" end="00:19:33.460" style="s2">don&#39;t because I I worked in the direct</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:36.100" style="s2">mail business in the 90s and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.460" end="00:19:39.820" style="s2">by 1996 with what the data aggregators</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.100" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">had Axium etc there is no privacy so</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.820" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">fuck it right just go yeah privacy you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.770" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s all hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.380" style="s2">this idea that you know we&#39;ve been you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.770" end="00:19:51.970" style="s2">know strip mined for data by the the big</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.380" end="00:19:54.040" style="s2">tech companies and then before that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.970" end="00:19:55.809" style="s2">direct marketing companies for four</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.040" end="00:19:57.220" style="s2">decades we don&#39;t have any trust in any</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.809" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2">of those companies to provide to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.220" end="00:20:01.570" style="s2">right by us regarding the data and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:02.919" style="s2">kind of treated data</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.570" end="00:20:05.019" style="s2">which is one of the most valuable</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.919" end="00:20:07.989" style="s2">resources in the world it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.019" end="00:20:10.749" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a product of you you&#39;re it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.989" end="00:20:14.169" style="s2">like a piece of your labor as something</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.749" end="00:20:16.919" style="s2">that&#39;s valueless I mean it&#39;s valued by</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.169" end="00:20:19.450" style="s2">all the companies that can grab it but</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.919" end="00:20:22.059" style="s2">our only solution to it is to treat it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.450" end="00:20:23.710" style="s2">you know to apply privacy to it which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.059" end="00:20:26.350" style="s2">really just destroying the value of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.710" end="00:20:28.570" style="s2">and the what we need to kind of get over</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.350" end="00:20:30.429" style="s2">this lack of trust in the government and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:32.919" style="s2">lack of trust in corporations is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.429" end="00:20:34.779" style="s2">idea that you actually own your data</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.919" end="00:20:36.639" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s clearly the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.779" end="00:20:38.950" style="s2">right personally I would sell all my</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.639" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">health data for $5.00 right because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.950" end="00:20:43.929" style="s2">believe that health data is more</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:47.019" style="s2">beneficial to the Commons than the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.929" end="00:20:48.729" style="s2">privacy of it is worth to me right but</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.019" end="00:20:50.309" style="s2">other people might make different</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.729" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">decisions and it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.309" end="00:20:55.509" style="s2">that&#39;s the key thing about the dance on</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:56.769" style="s2">the back side of this curve is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.509" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">need data from a hundred percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.769" end="00:21:01.090" style="s2">people you need statistically valid</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:03.789" style="s2">sampling data and it may well on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.090" end="00:21:06.429" style="s2">population of let&#39;s say at the state</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.789" end="00:21:08.590" style="s2">level three or four million you may need</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.429" end="00:21:10.539" style="s2">a few thousand people providing high</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.590" end="00:21:12.940" style="s2">fidelity data to give you a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.539" end="00:21:14.679" style="s2">the native incidence rate and and have</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.940" end="00:21:17.590" style="s2">the powers-that-be be able to respond</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.679" end="00:21:20.349" style="s2">forcibly to a local flare-up so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.590" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">of personal ownership of the data and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.349" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">voluntary opting in for a consideration</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:28.929" style="s2">and then licensing to the commonweal for</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.929" end="00:21:35.950" style="s2">say to some consortium of Apple</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.950" end="00:21:40.779" style="s2">monitoring for kovat and oh by the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:43.049" style="s2">this grant has a time to live of one</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.779" end="00:21:45.789" style="s2">year and if you violate it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.049" end="00:21:47.590" style="s2">$250,000 penalty right something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.789" end="00:21:49.479" style="s2">that would make great sense and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.590" end="00:21:51.849" style="s2">then if some people want to be paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.479" end="00:21:53.830" style="s2">about their data oh let them let those</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.849" end="00:21:56.739" style="s2">of us who are more realist about privacy</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.830" end="00:21:59.349" style="s2">and the relative benefits of at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.739" end="00:22:00.789" style="s2">some data in the Commons opt that way</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.349" end="00:22:03.279" style="s2">then we&#39;d get a clearer signal and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.789" end="00:22:06.099" style="s2">would make managing this very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.279" end="00:22:07.570" style="s2">practical oh yeah I mean there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.099" end="00:22:09.489" style="s2">to kind of accelerate it though I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.570" end="00:22:11.349" style="s2">I&#39;ve been pushing kind of because the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.489" end="00:22:13.059" style="s2">scale of the crisis this emergency you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.349" end="00:22:14.500" style="s2">bi kind of thing but we change that to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.059" end="00:22:17.290" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.500" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">a kind of a pandemic response payment</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.290" end="00:22:21.040" style="s2">you know a thousand bucks a month for</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:22.510" style="s2">contributing the data for participation</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.040" end="00:22:24.280" style="s2">to do the individual health monitoring</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.280" end="00:22:29.320" style="s2">on a daily basis all the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.890" end="00:22:31.510" style="s2">you&#39;d opt-in with using the smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.320" end="00:22:33.940" style="s2">you get ninety ninety five percent</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.510" end="00:22:36.670" style="s2">participation rates and you&#39;d get data</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.940" end="00:22:38.200" style="s2">down to such a granular level and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.670" end="00:22:39.970" style="s2">would be going in and you get paid for</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.200" end="00:22:41.530" style="s2">it and with set expectations that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.970" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">would actually get paid for your data I</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.530" end="00:22:45.460" style="s2">like it I like it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:47.740" style="s2">let&#39;s talk briefly about ubi and one</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.460" end="00:22:50.470" style="s2">other very interesting topic you and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.740" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">both like you be I think in concept but</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.470" end="00:22:56.110" style="s2">the more I&#39;ve thought about it respect</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">to this particular pandemic the less I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.110" end="00:23:00.580" style="s2">convinced that an ongoing ubi is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:03.000" style="s2">right answer at least in the form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.580" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">currently being implemented which is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.000" end="00:23:08.770" style="s2">electronic transfer to your checking</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:12.250" style="s2">account because we go back to the 2008</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.770" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">financial crisis we found that then more</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.250" end="00:23:18.550" style="s2">than 70% of those stimulus checks like</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:20.230" style="s2">was it twice they were sent out ended up</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.550" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">going into people&#39;s savings which makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.230" end="00:23:24.130" style="s2">sense you know when when the system</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:27.220" style="s2">seems under stress when uncertainty is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.130" end="00:23:29.830" style="s2">high those people who have jobs and have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.220" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">at least a little financial buffer will</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.830" end="00:23:35.590" style="s2">tend to add net liquidity to savings and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.260" style="s2">that&#39;s indeed what I expect will happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.590" end="00:23:40.090" style="s2">with this one so 70% of this large</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.260" end="00:23:41.650" style="s2">amount of money is essentially waste</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.090" end="00:23:43.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not truly wasting so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.650" end="00:23:47.320" style="s2">little bit of impact on behavior but not</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.750" end="00:23:48.850" style="s2">much and as you know you&#39;ve heard me say</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.320" end="00:23:51.610" style="s2">before that if we could send these</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.850" end="00:23:54.430" style="s2">things out as debit cards that had a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.610" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">time to live 45 days and if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.430" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">spend the money on the debit card 45</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:00.430" style="s2">days it evaporated back into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.950" style="s2">Treasury&#39;s pool of money to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.430" end="00:24:05.980" style="s2">reallocated the following month then I</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.950" end="00:24:08.350" style="s2">think a ubi could be very stimulative to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.980" end="00:24:10.620" style="s2">the economy but since no one seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.350" end="00:24:13.630" style="s2">running with this debit card idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.620" end="00:24:16.270" style="s2">probably the smarter thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.630" end="00:24:19.000" style="s2">massively augment unemployment checks</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.270" end="00:24:23.110" style="s2">maybe just increase them by 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.000" end="00:24:25.210" style="s2">or a hundred percent because why yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.110" end="00:24:26.980" style="s2">well there are they doing an actual I</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.210" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">know they&#39;re extended the term yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.980" end="00:24:29.590" style="s2">I think it&#39;s some places they&#39;re upping</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:31.809" style="s2">well anyway that&#39;s where all the money</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:33.280" style="s2">should go shouldn&#39;t go into UVI unless</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.809" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">you can find that way to have it have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.280" end="00:24:37.630" style="s2">time to live so it gets spent into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:39.669" style="s2">economy and not just saved much better</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.630" end="00:24:40.330" style="s2">because most people a lot of people a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.669" end="00:24:42.250" style="s2">huge number</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.330" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">tragic number of people have lost their</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.250" end="00:24:46.330" style="s2">jobs and will continue to lose their</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">jobs over the coming forty five days or</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.330" end="00:24:49.450" style="s2">so the vast preponderance of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">still have their jobs probably eighty</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.450" end="00:24:54.370" style="s2">percent so they don&#39;t really need the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">UVI in fact that we rank Li we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.370" end="00:24:57.750" style="s2">probably all financially but we still</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:24:59.980" style="s2">have our jobs or our sources of income</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.750" end="00:25:02.440" style="s2">are actually better off because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.980" end="00:25:04.299" style="s2">spending a shitload less right think</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.440" end="00:25:06.040" style="s2">about how much money people wasted going</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.299" end="00:25:08.980" style="s2">out to our restaurants and bars you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.040" end="00:25:10.660" style="s2">I remember when I was 29 years old it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.980" end="00:25:13.000" style="s2">was a non-trivial percentage of my total</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.660" end="00:25:15.280" style="s2">income you know currently we&#39;re at home</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.000" end="00:25:17.020" style="s2">eating beans and rice so people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.280" end="00:25:18.309" style="s2">expenditure has gone down their income</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.020" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">eighty percent of people&#39;s incomes</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.309" end="00:25:22.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t of employed people so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">really not a need for a ubi but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.540" end="00:25:26.429" style="s2">focus at all unless we can have time to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:28.660" style="s2">live let&#39;s focus it on the unemployed</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.429" end="00:25:30.669" style="s2">yeah you know I&#39;ve found that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.660" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">response at least at the bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.669" end="00:25:35.140" style="s2">government response to this crisis has</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">been been terrible because I think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.140" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">the scale of it the timeframes are so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:44.470" style="s2">short the scale is so large that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:45.850" style="s2">really just flubbed it they just even</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.470" end="00:25:47.799" style="s2">you know the complete bipartisan</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.850" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">cooperation can&#39;t get it done I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.799" end="00:25:50.440" style="s2">that two and a half trillion for</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:53.950" style="s2">actually four and a half of you taken</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.440" end="00:25:57.790" style="s2">all the money relief bill was an example</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.950" end="00:25:59.890" style="s2">of just total disaster I mean yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.790" end="00:26:02.860" style="s2">rules weren&#39;t simple yeah oh yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.890" end="00:26:04.299" style="s2">the SBA stuff I mean I mean the Small</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.860" end="00:26:05.500" style="s2">Business Association I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.299" end="00:26:07.270" style="s2">ninety-six percent of small businesses</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.500" end="00:26:09.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t get anything I mean it was rated</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.270" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">by the big companies uh it just wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.239" end="00:27:35.389" style="s2">for the country it was it would be a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.759" end="00:27:37.359" style="s2">boom and people could plan against that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.389" end="00:27:41.299" style="s2">they would spend the money they would</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.109" end="00:28:02.629" style="s2">due to that event and that was this much</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.059" end="00:28:04.519" style="s2">smaller event than this you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.629" end="00:28:08.869" style="s2">want to spend a decade crawling out of a</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.909" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">are going to be extremely dire I agree</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.049" end="00:28:32.570" style="s2">bunny for government oh yeah that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.659" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">really useful right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.570" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">Republicans baby along lobbied for</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">corporate welfare so both of them are</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.299" style="s2">wrong yeah yeah the cool thing about a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:42.470" style="s2">consensus and dissent framework is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.299" end="00:28:44.119" style="s2">makes it really different from the old</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.470" end="00:28:46.730" style="s2">left-right framework that you used to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.119" end="00:28:48.619" style="s2">have the left-right we use the you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.730" end="00:28:50.270" style="s2">big government small government values</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.619" end="00:28:52.940" style="s2">associated with each</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.270" end="00:28:55.880" style="s2">consensus to set framework is detached</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.940" end="00:28:59.390" style="s2">from specific policies or to attach from</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.880" end="00:29:04.220" style="s2">specific value sets the consent conform</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.390" end="00:29:06.830" style="s2">/ owned anything whatever is opposite</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.220" end="00:29:09.710" style="s2">could can do it yeah we need to give</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.830" end="00:29:11.330" style="s2">those that maybe the right answer is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.710" end="00:29:13.580" style="s2">problems the network doesn&#39;t have its</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.330" end="00:29:16.790" style="s2">levers on power directly right wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.580" end="00:29:19.400" style="s2">it be clever if you know that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.790" end="00:29:21.860" style="s2">the network and the dissent both could</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.400" end="00:29:24.010" style="s2">allocate the stimulus money for instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.860" end="00:29:27.620" style="s2">right something like my liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.010" end="00:29:29.210" style="s2">ideas where you know people vote how</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.620" end="00:29:30.170" style="s2">they want to vote they proxy to people</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.210" end="00:29:32.690" style="s2">who know more than they do</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.170" end="00:29:34.250" style="s2">and then you know let&#39;s say the dollars</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.690" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">are at the end of the day allocated by</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.250" end="00:29:40.160" style="s2">the number of votes that no final leaf</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:42.080" style="s2">level proxy holders hold and they caucus</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.160" end="00:29:43.730" style="s2">and they choose things to spend the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.080" end="00:29:45.770" style="s2">money on something like that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.730" end="00:29:48.290" style="s2">very interesting but you know today the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.770" end="00:29:50.870" style="s2">network does that work and the dissent</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.290" end="00:29:53.180" style="s2">is not directly coupled to the levers of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.870" end="00:29:55.640" style="s2">power that&#39;s a political power yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.180" end="00:29:57.050" style="s2">it means shut down the US economy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.640" end="00:29:58.840" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna keep it shut down until it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.050" end="00:30:03.290" style="s2">decides that it wants to you know to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.840" end="00:30:04.730" style="s2">release it that state and the the states</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.290" end="00:30:06.770" style="s2">and and the federal government really</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.730" end="00:30:10.250" style="s2">can just cajole them can make their</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.770" end="00:30:12.410" style="s2">arguments in favor of easing up but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.250" end="00:30:14.270" style="s2">network is gonna make the final decision</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.410" end="00:30:16.490" style="s2">it&#39;s most powerful thing and then they</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.270" end="00:30:18.470" style="s2">you know they the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.490" end="00:30:21.110" style="s2">could have shut shut down the economy I</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.470" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">mean even if it tried I mean it just</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.110" end="00:30:25.790" style="s2">could not do it as quickly and as</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:27.140" style="s2">effectively as the consensus did yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.790" end="00:30:30.650" style="s2">and in fact this actually reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.140" end="00:30:32.810" style="s2">in nineteen sixties saying by the New</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.650" end="00:30:35.330" style="s2">Left radicals which was vote with your</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.810" end="00:30:36.800" style="s2">feet in their sense they were saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.330" end="00:30:38.930" style="s2">quit your job and go become a hippie</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.800" end="00:30:41.630" style="s2">essentially in this case people voted</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.930" end="00:30:43.400" style="s2">with their feet by not going to work not</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.630" end="00:30:46.070" style="s2">going shopping and not getting on</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.400" end="00:30:49.970" style="s2">airplanes it&#39;s kind of very cool that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.070" end="00:30:53.060" style="s2">happen to be in a decision frame where</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:55.370" style="s2">we could actually vote with our feet and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.060" end="00:30:57.290" style="s2">it might be useful think about other</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.370" end="00:30:59.690" style="s2">scenarios we&#39;re voting with your feet is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.290" end="00:31:02.780" style="s2">is viable let&#39;s move on to my last topic</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.690" end="00:31:04.070" style="s2">here is a few minutes which to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.780" end="00:31:06.260" style="s2">one of the most entry</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.070" end="00:31:07.970" style="s2">seeing things that&#39;s happened in the as</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.260" end="00:31:09.770" style="s2">we start approaching the peak here and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.970" end="00:31:11.990" style="s2">soon to the managing the backside of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.770" end="00:31:16.100" style="s2">curve is the emergence of the state</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.990" end="00:31:18.800" style="s2">regional compacts as the way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.100" end="00:31:21.830" style="s2">aggregate learning and coordination on</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.800" end="00:31:24.440" style="s2">the gradual reopening I got to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.830" end="00:31:26.360" style="s2">like Churchill said in his history of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.440" end="00:31:28.550" style="s2">World War two then he hadn&#39;t had a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.360" end="00:31:33.860" style="s2">night&#39;s sleep from May 1940 until</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.550" end="00:31:35.990" style="s2">December 7th 1941 at Pearl Harbor where</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.860" end="00:31:38.690" style="s2">he knew World War two had just been won</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.990" end="00:31:41.720" style="s2">by the Allies I had a similar reaction</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.690" end="00:31:43.910" style="s2">the day the two compacts were announced</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.720" end="00:31:46.850" style="s2">I said holy shit</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.910" end="00:31:48.980" style="s2">maybe we will actually do a tolerable</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.850" end="00:31:52.450" style="s2">job of reopening the country in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.980" end="00:31:56.180" style="s2">nuanced regionally sensitive data-driven</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.450" end="00:31:58.850" style="s2">scientific fashion rather than relying</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.180" end="00:32:01.070" style="s2">on the shitshow in Washington what are</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:02.540" style="s2">your thoughts on these regional compacts</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.070" end="00:32:06.190" style="s2">and what might they mean for the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.540" end="00:32:10.130" style="s2">well you know one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.190" end="00:32:12.580" style="s2">decision-making systems handled threats</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.130" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">they can&#39;t handle is that they</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.580" end="00:32:17.810" style="s2">decentralize say you know in this case</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:20.930" style="s2">the level of governance that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.810" end="00:32:22.750" style="s2">effective it you know was found at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.930" end="00:32:26.870" style="s2">state level and that I guess at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.750" end="00:32:27.800" style="s2">regional block level in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.870" end="00:32:30.140" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and they&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.800" end="00:32:34.010" style="s2">information sharing resources but you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.140" end="00:32:35.690" style="s2">know they may accrue power you know over</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.010" end="00:32:37.280" style="s2">time remember they&#39;re extra</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.690" end="00:32:39.950" style="s2">constitutional so there is a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.280" end="00:32:41.780" style="s2">open-loop element here if it lasts a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.950" end="00:32:44.840" style="s2">long time and these are you know these</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.780" end="00:32:47.620" style="s2">blocks prove effective we can see you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.840" end="00:32:50.630" style="s2">know a lot of power accumulating in them</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.620" end="00:32:52.790" style="s2">and it may change you know the way the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.630" end="00:32:56.060" style="s2">nation is run I mean they&#39;re all around</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.130" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">relatively non-political way and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.290" end="00:35:23.940" style="s2">kind of MC an hour to of you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:25.860" style="s2">highlighting specific projects that like</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.940" end="00:35:28.290" style="s2">the one you mentioned and bringing it to</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.660" end="00:35:48.450" style="s2">decisions and having 10 or 20 million</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.470" end="00:35:50.820" style="s2">people working on it you can get it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.450" end="00:35:51.930" style="s2">solved really really quickly and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.820" end="00:35:54.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a resource that we haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.930" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">tapped into and it could be you know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.390" end="00:35:58.490" style="s2">you could you know somebody moved into</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.180" style="s2">that space that it could yield a</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.180" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">going forward damn great idea people so</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.260" end="00:36:09.210" style="s2">social entrepreneurs out there who have</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">a decent followership on YouTube or</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.210" end="00:36:12.570" style="s2">something let&#39;s run with let&#39;s run with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.070" style="s2">this idea let me know I&#39;ll promote it</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.570" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll help you bring in guests and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.070" end="00:36:19.080" style="s2">commentators and things like that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s a great idea and that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.080" end="00:36:22.260" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s just like I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:23.940" style="s2">just see it now there&#39;s a vacuum waiting</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.260" end="00:36:25.470" style="s2">for this to happen somebody ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.940" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">this whether it&#39;ll happen right now or</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.470" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">not because of the time is hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">but it ought to yeah I agree it well</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.780" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s just a an opportunity that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:37.350" style="s2">have been better and filled if it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:41.460" style="s2">done last month when people are still</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.350" end="00:36:42.270" style="s2">scrambling okay I will point out this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.460" end="00:36:44.490" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve been hitting</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.270" end="00:36:46.170" style="s2">regularly is managing the back side of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.490" end="00:36:48.330" style="s2">the kerbs could be a shitload harder</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.170" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">than managing the front side as it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.330" end="00:36:52.580" style="s2">turned out there was one brute force</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:55.080" style="s2">rubber hammer that worked which was</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.580" end="00:36:57.840" style="s2">social distancing period really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.080" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">the only thing that worked and if it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.840" end="00:37:01.140" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been for that the whole medical</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:03.780" style="s2">system would&#39;ve been overrun sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.140" end="00:37:05.880" style="s2">their weak-ass response on ventilators</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.780" end="00:37:09.750" style="s2">and PPEs would not have even come close</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.880" end="00:37:13.880" style="s2">to do the job so a d- job on</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.750" end="00:37:17.610" style="s2">mobilization in terms of equipment and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.880" end="00:37:20.310" style="s2">protocols etc was saved by one big brute</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.610" end="00:37:22.140" style="s2">force hammer there is not a brute force</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.310" end="00:37:24.630" style="s2">hammer on the back side of the curve</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.140" end="00:37:27.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a very nuanced that sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.630" end="00:37:28.770" style="s2">dance and so the need for these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.000" end="00:37:30.570" style="s2">may actually be greater on the back side</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.770" end="00:37:33.780" style="s2">than there was on the front side as it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.570" end="00:37:35.790" style="s2">turned out right yeah that&#39;s the back</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.780" end="00:37:37.500" style="s2">side the exit strategies are tough in it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.790" end="00:37:40.230" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m leaning towards the big</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.500" end="00:37:44.070" style="s2">tech thing it&#39;s a the two other</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.230" end="00:37:46.250" style="s2">solutions are too brutal and it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.070" end="00:37:48.900" style="s2">fragile kind of developed countries</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.250" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">ambulatory for the next you know decade</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.900" end="00:37:52.590" style="s2">right I can&#39;t see us getting out of it I</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:55.020" style="s2">mean no unless there&#39;s something out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.590" end="00:37:55.530" style="s2">the blue tech fix in terms of vaccine or</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.020" end="00:37:57.830" style="s2">treatment</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.530" end="00:38:01.020" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely brutal unless we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.830" end="00:38:02.550" style="s2">adopted the big tech fix as I earlier</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.020" end="00:38:04.830" style="s2">there is one other one which I actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.550" end="00:38:07.650" style="s2">think it&#39;s worth considering which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.830" end="00:38:10.350" style="s2">the Paul Romer insane level of testing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.650" end="00:38:12.210" style="s2">Thanks which could be the two could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.350" end="00:38:15.030" style="s2">combined Paul Romer the Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.210" end="00:38:17.220" style="s2">prize-winning economist has done some</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.030" end="00:38:19.350" style="s2">very interesting modeling which says if</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.220" end="00:38:23.310" style="s2">we do the number sounds insane</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.350" end="00:38:26.010" style="s2">22 million tests a day right so every</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.310" end="00:38:28.110" style="s2">adult gets tests every two weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.010" end="00:38:30.990" style="s2">that there was essentially instantaneous</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.990" end="00:38:35.010" style="s2">back side of that maybe publicly paid</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.790" end="00:38:36.900" style="s2">foreign teaming at hotels which will</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.010" end="00:38:39.210" style="s2">still be underutilized for a long period</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.900" end="00:38:41.790" style="s2">of time then we could get back to pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.210" end="00:38:43.350" style="s2">close to normal more or less instantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.790" end="00:38:45.540" style="s2">might take us three months to ramp up</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.350" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">that level of testing if we made a world</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.540" end="00:38:49.050" style="s2">war two level of commitment to it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:50.970" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think I like about it it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.050" end="00:38:52.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require any new computer systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.970" end="00:38:55.260" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t require any money to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.380" end="00:38:56.760" style="s2">cooperate it&#39;s a very brute for if it</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.260" end="00:38:58.500" style="s2">makes cooperate the level if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.760" end="00:39:01.890" style="s2">keep your job you have to be tested it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.500" end="00:39:04.050" style="s2">works right not coercive but pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.890" end="00:39:07.380" style="s2">persuasive or not mandatory but for any</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.790" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">may be actually done much more faster</p>
