<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">the reason is that that&#39;s not the aim</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">anymore the aim is to have a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:24.869" style="s2">theater and we also talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">issues raised by the recent rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.869" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">investigation into David Icke and London</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">London real hmm and I was glad you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">picked up on that that was a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:41.000" style="s2">corner in all of this Douglass thank you</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.000" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">yeah so we we&#39;ve spoken before a couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">of times from the channel and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:51.689" style="s2">talked about your latest book madness of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">crowds we talked about strange death of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.689" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">Europe and massive crowds really really</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.899" style="s2">interesting in it you kind of look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">the way the media portrays certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.899" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">perspective you want to give us a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">quick Pressy of what madness of crowds</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">is about before you go into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">of the detail sure the madness of crowds</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">came out late last year it&#39;s coming out</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.660" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">in paperback in September and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">what I regard is being all</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">crowd madnesses of our time the identity</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">issues that have roiled through our</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">societies of course since it came out</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve had different types of madness to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:29.820" style="s2">sin in our societies and so in a way the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:33.960" style="s2">interesting thing in this moment to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.820" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">is you know what is holding up in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.960" end="00:02:40.920" style="s2">and what seems already to be positively</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:43.710" style="s2">historical you know and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.920" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">because you know I I was I was saying as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.710" end="00:02:49.410" style="s2">I was writing it and I say in the book I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">mean these things of group identities</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.410" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">based on race gender sexuality and so on</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">are are shallow identities which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:04.940" style="s2">themselves the products of a vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">which I described in my previous book</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.940" end="00:03:09.950" style="s2">but I always thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">discussions on privilege and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.950" end="00:03:14.310" style="s2">microaggressions and all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:18.440" style="s2">that we were forced to hear about in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.310" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">daily basis was the product of a society</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.440" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">that was rich and comfortable and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">have enough to moan about because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:28.740" style="s2">can only moan about microaggressions if</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">you live in a society where there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.740" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">little aggression I&#39;ve heard a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:38.520" style="s2">people say that the virus has killed</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">work I&#39;m very wary of simply using the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.520" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">virus as a justification for your</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.440" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">pre-existing hopes and I think an awful</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">lot of people have done that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">that mean people who said well this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:52.170" style="s2">the end of this or the beginning of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">the triumph of this and and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.170" end="00:03:58.500" style="s2">a cough it always completely accords</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:01.260" style="s2">with their pre-existing views and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.500" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">just wary of that it did occur to me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.260" end="00:04:04.280" style="s2">not immune to that myself it did occur</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:07.230" style="s2">to me at the beginning of this virus</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.280" end="00:04:11.660" style="s2">well perhaps we&#39;ll hear a little less</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.230" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">from the whoa crowd I can&#39;t deny that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:18.419" style="s2">expect that wider society might have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">little less time for it now but but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.419" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">might just be me in imposing a hope on</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:26.460" style="s2">this but nevertheless I mean it you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">the recession that we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.460" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">in is a time when an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">families in countries like ours are</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">going to be suffering and seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">fall-off in their lifestyles and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">know considerable unemployment and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.789" style="s2">of the problems that come from that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">I just I think I think it&#39;s unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.789" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">that in that era we&#39;re going to spend as</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:53.639" style="s2">much time talking about what Sam Smith</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">wants to be called today but but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.639" end="00:04:59.210" style="s2">won&#39;t mean that people like that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:05:01.229" style="s2">keep doing that yeah I mean there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.210" end="00:05:03.330" style="s2">there&#39;s one topic that I&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.229" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">wanted to talk to you about since I read</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.330" end="00:05:08.849" style="s2">madness of crowds and that&#39;s subtle</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">differences that I&#39;m picking up between</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.849" end="00:05:14.849" style="s2">the UK and the u.s. attitude to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:17.340" style="s2">these topics and because I get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.849" end="00:05:20.190" style="s2">that there is quite subtle but quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.340" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">important differentiations of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.190" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">policing of these kind of arguments in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:27.000" style="s2">the UK in the u.s. I&#39;m going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:31.050" style="s2">trans example because I think it is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.000" end="00:05:33.900" style="s2">very illustrative example here with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.050" end="00:05:37.020" style="s2">Guardian UK edition brought out a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.900" end="00:05:38.909" style="s2">kind of vanilla leader article that said</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.020" end="00:05:42.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to understand that there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.909" end="00:05:45.060" style="s2">differing factors at play there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.090" end="00:05:47.610" style="s2">trade-offs for example around gender</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.060" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">identity and also same-sex attraction</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.610" end="00:05:55.380" style="s2">and that what has historically been the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">the defense of gay rights is threatened</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.380" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">by the the rejection of gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.409" style="s2">of trans etc just just laying out that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:04.349" style="s2">there are different factors at play and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.409" end="00:06:06.690" style="s2">that was rejected wholesale by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.349" end="00:06:10.740" style="s2">Guardians us staff as being transphobic</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.690" end="00:06:12.449" style="s2">and I get I get this sense that both in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.740" end="00:06:14.550" style="s2">the UK and the US this is a hugely</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.449" end="00:06:18.060" style="s2">polarizing a hugely activating debate</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.550" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">but there seems to be more of a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.060" end="00:06:22.440" style="s2">debate in my view in the UK maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:25.020" style="s2">because of our history of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.440" end="00:06:26.789" style="s2">radical feminism in the Labor Party but</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.020" end="00:06:28.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a slightly different background</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.789" end="00:06:30.509" style="s2">I&#39;m picking up subtle differences that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.650" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">in the u.s. if you deviate from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.509" end="00:06:35.639" style="s2">certain kind of fixed ideology you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:37.289" style="s2">put beyond the pale it&#39;s not just beyond</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.639" end="00:06:39.240" style="s2">the pale issues that you get put on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.289" end="00:06:40.230" style="s2">particular political side that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.240" end="00:06:44.700" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.230" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">is that I mean obviously the ideal is</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.010" end="00:07:53.340" style="s2">and the answer is just that the America</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.780" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">is stuck in the same position that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.340" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">Britain was stuck in until I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:02.880" style="s2">December the 12th last year where it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:05.910" style="s2">where everything in Britain was seen</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.910" end="00:08:09.870" style="s2">became a culture war to do with brexit</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.960" end="00:08:26.040" style="s2">discussion it was bad enough in America</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.730" end="00:08:27.480" style="s2">already because they had this endless</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.040" end="00:08:30.600" style="s2">thing of whether you were a Republican</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.480" end="00:08:32.070" style="s2">or a Democrat and you know there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.070" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">in the u.s. who realized that was a that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">is a really not helpful prism on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">of issues not all issues on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:45.900" style="s2">issues and so yeah I I&#39;m worried about</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:47.790" style="s2">this because all the America is the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.900" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">important country in the world it&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">cultural impact for good and ill is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.750" end="00:08:57.620" style="s2">global in a way that no other countries</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:59.060" style="s2">so and and I do think that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.620" end="00:09:00.890" style="s2">problems that we&#39;ve seen on the identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.060" end="00:09:02.690" style="s2">questions in recent years have to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.890" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">great extent come about because we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.690" end="00:09:07.130" style="s2">imported parts of the American debate</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:09.620" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve imported parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.130" end="00:09:12.010" style="s2">American race debate to the UK in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.620" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">which I think has been massively</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.010" end="00:09:20.510" style="s2">deleterious for the UK and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:22.970" style="s2">it matters when when the major democracy</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.510" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">in the world has a debate this bad and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.970" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">public thinking so poor yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:30.769" style="s2">already going into the area that I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:34.339" style="s2">hoping to go into next and I do I get</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.769" end="00:09:37.430" style="s2">this sense that the pandemic certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.339" end="00:09:38.750" style="s2">the the fault lines exposing in America</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.430" end="00:09:41.380" style="s2">and the way that it seems to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.750" end="00:09:44.529" style="s2">accelerating almost like a catalyst of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.380" end="00:09:47.180" style="s2">the already existing culture war seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.529" end="00:09:50.329" style="s2">existential to me almost in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.180" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t in the UK and you had an</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.329" end="00:09:55.250" style="s2">interview recently with Joe where I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:57.829" style="s2">think politics Joe I think it was when</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.250" end="00:09:59.329" style="s2">you pointed out how the UK in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.829" end="00:10:00.680" style="s2">are reacting very differently to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.329" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.680" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">drill down into why that might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:06.589" style="s2">because there was also this sense for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:08.390" style="s2">long time you pointed out that the UK</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.589" end="00:10:10.910" style="s2">had very similar fault lines we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.390" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">trust our experts we we didn&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.910" end="00:10:14.810" style="s2">media all of these same fault lines but</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:17.329" style="s2">actually since the pandemic has struck</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.810" end="00:10:19.910" style="s2">there&#39;s been this sense of kind of some</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.329" end="00:10:21.740" style="s2">kind of I don&#39;t know sobering up in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.910" end="00:10:24.500" style="s2">way in the UK that has happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.740" end="00:10:27.020" style="s2">u.s. I agree I mean I think that i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.500" end="00:10:29.990" style="s2">that Boris Johnson has been able to call</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.020" end="00:10:33.290" style="s2">on goodwill that we didn&#39;t know was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.990" end="00:10:36.620" style="s2">there until recently or we&#39;d forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.290" end="00:10:38.750" style="s2">was there I think that is partly to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.620" end="00:10:41.540" style="s2">with him partly to do with his his</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.750" end="00:10:43.100" style="s2">history I think that if the Conservative</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.540" end="00:10:46.510" style="s2">Party at this stage had been led by a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.100" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">highly authoritarian right-wing figure</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.510" end="00:10:52.790" style="s2">who looked like he really wanted to lock</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.709" style="s2">the British people in our homes I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.790" end="00:11:00.529" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t have agreed with such</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.709" end="00:11:02.839" style="s2">alacrity and this this of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.529" end="00:11:06.519" style="s2">detractors all the criticism he comes in</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.839" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">for I do think that is worth remembering</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.519" end="00:11:11.319" style="s2">I think that Britain is in a healthy ish</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.499" style="s2">position on that we&#39;re not in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.319" end="00:11:16.929" style="s2">position economically but then no one is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.499" end="00:11:20.109" style="s2">but but we we have trust in the experts</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.929" end="00:11:22.239" style="s2">by the way there is a huge caveat coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.109" end="00:11:25.239" style="s2">there isn&#39;t there which I&#39;m sure you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.239" end="00:11:28.209" style="s2">feel as I can feel which is what if what</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.239" end="00:11:32.759" style="s2">if the experts are shown to have got</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.209" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">this very significantly wrong or have</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.759" end="00:11:40.149" style="s2">have got them their predictions way out</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:42.009" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to think that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.149" end="00:11:44.199" style="s2">case perhaps I&#39;m slow to the party on</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.009" end="00:11:48.309" style="s2">that but I think most of us are starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.199" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">to notice that that the virus is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.309" end="00:11:52.629" style="s2">worse than some people have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:59.079" style="s2">pretending and not as bad as we first</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.629" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">feared and if it does turn out that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.079" end="00:12:05.410" style="s2">the scientists got it wrong at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:08.049" style="s2">beginning I worry the what trust we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.410" end="00:12:11.259" style="s2">just refound in expertise is about to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.049" end="00:12:13.329" style="s2">lost in a way that that it hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.259" end="00:12:15.999" style="s2">since I know our loss of trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.329" end="00:12:20.919" style="s2">intelligence community after the WI WMD</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.999" end="00:12:23.169" style="s2">issue in 2003 so that that does worry me</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.919" end="00:12:25.299" style="s2">but but yes broadly speaking we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.169" end="00:12:27.549" style="s2">better place in America where where</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.299" end="00:12:29.579" style="s2">people don&#39;t don&#39;t half the country</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.549" end="00:12:33.209" style="s2">doesn&#39;t trust the president at all and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.579" end="00:12:36.339" style="s2">and I think certainly in some sections</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.209" end="00:12:39.129" style="s2">would be happy for the economy to crash</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.339" end="00:12:41.919" style="s2">as long as it crashes on Donald Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.129" end="00:12:45.939" style="s2">watch and therefore he doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.919" end="00:12:48.429" style="s2">reelected yeah I mean certainly true</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.939" end="00:12:50.199" style="s2">that Trump is a factor like Trump from</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.429" end="00:12:51.970" style="s2">sort of derangement syndrome as people</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.199" end="00:12:56.289" style="s2">have talked about I think exist on both</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:12:57.789" style="s2">sides by Pro and ante yeah but I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.289" end="00:13:01.089" style="s2">if there&#39;s other factors as well this</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.789" end="00:13:03.249" style="s2">sense of this sort of I get the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.089" end="00:13:05.289" style="s2">a civic space in the UK that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.249" end="00:13:07.209" style="s2">outside of the dynamics of polarization</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.289" end="00:13:10.089" style="s2">and there&#39;s all sorts of reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.209" end="00:13:12.069" style="s2">that I think that I wonder whether the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.089" end="00:13:14.139" style="s2">BBC has something to do with that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.069" end="00:13:17.079" style="s2">there is at least some some center of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.139" end="00:13:18.209" style="s2">power that is not being pulled one side</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.079" end="00:13:20.610" style="s2">or the other by Corp</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.209" end="00:13:23.550" style="s2">factors and by the sort of polarization</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.610" end="00:13:25.740" style="s2">spiral what do you what what else do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.550" end="00:13:27.869" style="s2">think might be behind these two</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.740" end="00:13:29.579" style="s2">different yeah I think it&#39;s that I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.869" end="00:13:31.139" style="s2">I think I have to say this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.579" end="00:13:33.990" style="s2">point I&#39;ve made a few times in recent</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.139" end="00:13:35.910" style="s2">weeks and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in some ways a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.990" end="00:13:38.040" style="s2">very obvious one which is just that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.910" end="00:13:40.679" style="s2">do have some institutions that are above</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.040" end="00:13:43.470" style="s2">politics the clearest and most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.679" end="00:13:45.389" style="s2">of which is the monarchy and full of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.470" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">criticisms that levelled by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.389" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2">Republicans in the UK I think they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:56.730" style="s2">was about the only figure we really</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:14:00.839" style="s2">wanted to give her take in the early</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.730" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">weeks and I do think that you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.839" end="00:14:08.749" style="s2">small C conservative I I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:11.579" style="s2">encouraged by that because conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.749" end="00:14:14.790" style="s2">in the way I understand it has an awful</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.579" end="00:14:16.610" style="s2">lot to do with institutions and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.790" end="00:14:19.350" style="s2">that&#39;s built on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.610" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">institutions reflect the public and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.350" end="00:14:24.360" style="s2">and that they are they are reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:26.369" style="s2">things that the public gives trust to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.360" end="00:14:29.189" style="s2">the institution and the institution</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.369" end="00:14:33.329" style="s2">gives trust to the public and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.189" end="00:14:34.529" style="s2">they&#39;re complimentary and of course it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.329" end="00:14:37.889" style="s2">means that people are loyal to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.529" end="00:14:40.559" style="s2">institutions that are loyal to them but</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.889" end="00:14:43.529" style="s2">these bonds are incredibly important and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.559" end="00:14:45.329" style="s2">maybe they aren&#39;t built up overnight you</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.529" end="00:14:46.769" style="s2">know the bond that does does exist for</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.329" end="00:14:50.069" style="s2">all the criticisms I and many others</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.769" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">level at them with the BBC there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.069" end="00:14:54.509" style="s2">level of trust that means that when</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:15:00.209" style="s2">something pandemic something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.509" end="00:15:02.129" style="s2">occurs you know we we do turn on the BBC</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.209" end="00:15:06.509" style="s2">that something like the VE Day</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.129" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">celebrations last week the BBC does the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.509" end="00:15:12.089" style="s2">job you know and and that&#39;s that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:14.069" style="s2">important but you know that the central</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.089" end="00:15:16.829" style="s2">insight of conservatism on this is of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.069" end="00:15:19.379" style="s2">course is that such trust takes an</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.829" end="00:15:21.179" style="s2">awfully long time to build and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.379" end="00:15:23.129" style="s2">important and significant meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.179" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">institutions take a very long time to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.129" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:29.870" style="s2">with the rider that of course they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.420" end="00:15:32.210" style="s2">be destroyed very easily I mean it would</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.870" end="00:15:34.760" style="s2">be it would be extremely easy to deer</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.210" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">ass innate the public space but at times</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.760" end="00:15:40.820" style="s2">like this you would recognize I hope</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:42.860" style="s2">some of the consequences had that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.820" end="00:15:46.210" style="s2">happened you know if if the cut and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.860" end="00:15:49.930" style="s2">the United Kingdom had to wait on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.210" end="00:15:54.110" style="s2">the first speech by president kinegg</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.930" end="00:15:56.750" style="s2">about the virus where he could reflect</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.110" end="00:15:58.610" style="s2">on his lessons from nineteen eighties</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.750" end="00:16:00.440" style="s2">Labour Party politics or something I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.610" end="00:16:03.400" style="s2">don&#39;t think the country would be and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.440" end="00:16:05.540" style="s2">remotely as healthier condition as it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.400" end="00:16:07.370" style="s2">and I think you can do that on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.540" end="00:16:09.860" style="s2">range of institutions but I don&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.370" end="00:16:13.270" style="s2">glib about it but or you know I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.860" end="00:16:15.380" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rosy</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.270" end="00:16:17.060" style="s2">now it&#39;s interesting you bring up the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.380" end="00:16:19.070" style="s2">idea of institutions because the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.060" end="00:16:21.050" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m really interested to talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.070" end="00:16:23.150" style="s2">to you about is the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.050" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">influence of the tech platforms because</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.150" end="00:16:27.380" style="s2">what we are what we have been saying in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:29.420" style="s2">in the media is this huge kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.380" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">washing away of a lot of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.420" end="00:16:33.170" style="s2">memory and a lot of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:35.450" style="s2">standards we have this whole thing about</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.170" end="00:16:37.760" style="s2">the tech platform suddenly making them</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.450" end="00:16:39.080" style="s2">the realization that they are actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.760" end="00:16:41.930" style="s2">publishers well they have to take on</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.080" end="00:16:44.960" style="s2">some responsibility as publishers and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.930" end="00:16:47.720" style="s2">speak as someone who&#39;s been part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.960" end="00:16:49.580" style="s2">channel for being part of the BBC and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.720" end="00:16:52.730" style="s2">then kind of gone outside and made my</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.580" end="00:16:55.640" style="s2">own films and really enjoyed the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.730" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">to to look at narratives that are often</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.640" end="00:17:00.050" style="s2">excluded by the mainstream and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.070" end="00:17:02.990" style="s2">realize the value of that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.050" end="00:17:05.530" style="s2">but also being sort of terrified by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.990" end="00:17:09.260" style="s2">spread of misinformation and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.530" end="00:17:10.790" style="s2">it feels like a very dangerous I&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.260" end="00:17:12.050" style="s2">of called it an interregnum we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.790" end="00:17:14.120" style="s2">this sort of we were in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.050" end="00:17:15.650" style="s2">institutional framework that has now</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.120" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">been kind of washed away and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.650" end="00:17:20.870" style="s2">yet have I could imagine a kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">decentralized way of finding truth of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.870" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">sort of like I don&#39;t know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:26.450" style="s2">but we&#39;re not there we sort of seem to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:28.340" style="s2">be in a very dangerous place while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.450" end="00:17:29.870" style="s2">in this interregnum and there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.340" end="00:17:31.160" style="s2">gatekeepers and there&#39;s no real way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.870" end="00:17:35.410" style="s2">asserting what&#39;s true anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.160" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">it it actually does have a significant</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.410" end="00:17:40.040" style="s2">similarity with the issue they brought</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:44.210" style="s2">earlier about the brexit and Trump issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.040" end="00:17:45.710" style="s2">you know my sadness about both of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.210" end="00:17:49.040" style="s2">issues in recent years has been the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.710" end="00:17:54.230" style="s2">opportunity cost of the opponents of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.040" end="00:17:56.810" style="s2">these realities avoiding the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.230" end="00:17:58.970" style="s2">to learn from something one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.810" end="00:18:00.950" style="s2">things is they lost the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.970" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">recognize that the American public voted</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.950" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">for Donald Trump despite everything that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:08.390" style="s2">they knew about him in 2016 it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">same thing with the brexit thing you</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.390" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">know I happen to be in favor of brexit</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:16.040" style="s2">like the majority of the British public</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:19.010" style="s2">but I just I think it was a massive</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.040" end="00:18:21.410" style="s2">mistake of people who voted the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.010" end="00:18:25.700" style="s2">way to have lost to miss the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.410" end="00:18:27.800" style="s2">for years to recognize that day had</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.700" end="00:18:30.050" style="s2">missed something they&#39;ve got something</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.800" end="00:18:32.750" style="s2">wrong they massively misread something</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.050" end="00:18:34.460" style="s2">and maybe the population were under</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.750" end="00:18:36.650" style="s2">something and it&#39;s the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.460" end="00:18:38.900" style="s2">the media issue you just raise the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.650" end="00:18:41.260" style="s2">question is why the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.900" end="00:18:44.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t learn from what it keeps missing</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.260" end="00:18:47.810" style="s2">why there&#39;s so much that it just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.150" end="00:18:51.050" style="s2">do why doesn&#39;t it why doesn&#39;t it listen</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.810" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">to that and I and I know as I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.050" end="00:18:57.950" style="s2">do individuals in all the major channels</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:19:00.110" style="s2">who know that they&#39;ve been missing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.950" end="00:19:01.970" style="s2">something and they know they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.110" end="00:19:04.250" style="s2">missing something out they feel it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.970" end="00:19:05.990" style="s2">make their and they but as an author as</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.250" end="00:19:11.270" style="s2">an institutional level they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.990" end="00:19:13.550" style="s2">what to do about that and and and I I</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.270" end="00:19:16.730" style="s2">just think that they&#39;ve they&#39;ve they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.550" end="00:19:18.980" style="s2">missed something and it&#39;s it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.730" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">them as I say it&#39;s common it&#39;s a common</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.980" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">issue of our time some kind of inability</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:27.730" style="s2">to ameliorate facts and truths that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:30.500" style="s2">should have been ameliorated by now I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.730" end="00:19:32.540" style="s2">completely agree and we&#39;ve put out quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.500" end="00:19:33.920" style="s2">a lot of pieces around that like what</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.540" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">the mainstream is missing and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.920" end="00:19:40.090" style="s2">critical that is the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:42.380" style="s2">they&#39;re missing it and being completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.090" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">surprised by things they didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.380" end="00:19:47.930" style="s2">is is like an existential problem but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:51.080" style="s2">also I&#39;m wondering whether you also have</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.930" end="00:19:51.559" style="s2">some concerns as I do of the as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.080" end="00:19:53.179" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.559" end="00:19:55.999" style="s2">conspiracy theories rising</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.179" end="00:19:58.419" style="s2">misinformation rising is sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.999" end="00:20:00.769" style="s2">other side of that kind of that pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.419" end="00:20:03.470" style="s2">real concerns as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.769" end="00:20:05.450" style="s2">I saw your video on Brian Rose and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.470" end="00:20:07.129" style="s2">London real hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.450" end="00:20:09.320" style="s2">and I was glad you picked up on that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.129" end="00:20:12.830" style="s2">that was a fascinating corner in all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.320" end="00:20:15.620" style="s2">this and it speaks very much to you the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.830" end="00:20:17.330" style="s2">concern you&#39;ve just expressed yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.620" end="00:20:19.879" style="s2">glad you saw that yeah what did you make</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.330" end="00:20:23.269" style="s2">I tried to bring in all of the wider</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.879" end="00:20:25.220" style="s2">issues which is my concern is that if if</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.269" end="00:20:27.139" style="s2">somehow we don&#39;t find a way of self</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.220" end="00:20:29.389" style="s2">policing that we&#39;re going to get really</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.139" end="00:20:32.570" style="s2">heavy hand of tech censorship that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.389" end="00:20:34.460" style="s2">not going to be able to buy I just don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.149" end="00:20:58.309" style="s2">particular ways I think into it into</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.149" end="00:21:00.580" style="s2">trying to sort that out the first is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.309" end="00:21:03.559" style="s2">think that the people currently</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.580" end="00:21:06.710" style="s2">populating the firms are not up to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.559" end="00:21:10.039" style="s2">task the second is they wouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.879" style="s2">the massive problem on this with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.210" end="00:21:20.360" style="s2">tech companies in the US and the UK is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.879" end="00:21:23.119" style="s2">the fact that they have been in in both</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.119" end="00:21:29.509" style="s2">particular political side so it&#39;s in the</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.869" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">should say differently to say sounds I</p>

<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:50.210" style="s2">when it when that administration left</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.730" end="00:21:52.429" style="s2">power the you know so many people went</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.210" end="00:21:56.749" style="s2">straight into Silicon Valley and got</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.769" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">something very similar happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.899" end="00:22:14.450" style="s2">UK I mean since the Liberal Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">were very nearly wiped out not quite</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">thought seriously about any issues</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.179" end="00:22:40.970" style="s2">certainly not about this one certainly</p>

<p begin="00:22:40.970" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">free speech certainly not about how you</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.090" end="00:23:00.860" style="s2">that but they have a few existing</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.860" end="00:23:06.049" style="s2">unfortunately the way of both in the US</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.230" end="00:23:09.980" style="s2">and the UK that that expresses itself is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.049" end="00:23:14.120" style="s2">the fact that they have this weird idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.980" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">that there is sort of you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.120" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">tackle extremism for instance as a thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.700" end="00:23:23.389" style="s2">rather than particular manifestations of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">it that are particularly close to the</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.659" end="00:24:01.429" style="s2">platforms are gonna have a war on pride</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.549" end="00:24:02.750" style="s2">I hate I mean really and from that once</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.429" end="00:24:06.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve decided that your self-appointed</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.750" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">task is to tackle hate well it means</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.620" end="00:24:11.029" style="s2">among other things you&#39;ll take out some</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:13.940" style="s2">things that are true and and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.029" end="00:24:15.529" style="s2">you&#39;ll go for I mean the problem on this</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.940" end="00:24:17.690" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s personal for me as it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.529" end="00:24:19.370" style="s2">for you the problem on all this is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.690" end="00:24:21.110" style="s2">repeatedly seen how close</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.370" end="00:24:26.860" style="s2">our own boats these people are willing</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.110" end="00:24:29.990" style="s2">to come you know not to me not to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:32.030" style="s2">but people we think should be in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.990" end="00:24:34.790" style="s2">discussion sometimes people we know of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.030" end="00:24:36.890" style="s2">spoken with who you know you discover</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.790" end="00:24:39.650" style="s2">reviewed by YouTube or something as</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.100" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">mean this is obviously part of a wider</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.430" end="00:24:52.190" style="s2">language and political slippage you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">in our own lifetimes far-right has come</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.190" end="00:24:56.780" style="s2">to be a term which instead of being used</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:59.300" style="s2">very specifically and necessarily on</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.780" end="00:25:01.220" style="s2">occasion has become just something can</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.300" end="00:25:05.090" style="s2">call anyone if you don&#39;t like them much</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.220" end="00:25:06.770" style="s2">want to do them a bit of harm you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.090" end="00:25:09.980" style="s2">and and and these people have got</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.770" end="00:25:10.910" style="s2">unbelievable power and and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.980" end="00:25:12.260" style="s2">not worthy of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.910" end="00:25:15.130" style="s2">but that comes the second buy which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.260" end="00:25:19.580" style="s2">is it possible for anyone to do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.130" end="00:25:22.160" style="s2">even if Eric and load rather brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.580" end="00:25:24.200" style="s2">people were in charge of it could they</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.160" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">do it could could you do it could I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.200" end="00:25:29.179" style="s2">it I don&#39;t know I mean I I think to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">great extent this is the problem of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.179" end="00:25:34.130" style="s2">is this second bit hoo-hoo-hoo and earth</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:36.679" style="s2">would you give the right to police the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.130" end="00:25:40.490" style="s2">Internet to you know who&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.679" end="00:25:42.110" style="s2">candidate you do you think I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.490" end="00:25:45.559" style="s2">is the other issue is that especially on</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.110" end="00:25:47.750" style="s2">YouTube there&#39;s such a kind of free</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.559" end="00:25:50.050" style="s2">speech absolutism so people kind of deny</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.750" end="00:25:54.650" style="s2">the need for any placing whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.050" end="00:25:56.840" style="s2">which to me seems naive especially when</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.650" end="00:25:58.270" style="s2">you come I think a good example recently</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.840" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">is like okay we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.270" end="00:26:03.350" style="s2">something like medical cures we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:05.570" style="s2">regulations around kind of miracle cures</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.350" end="00:26:07.700" style="s2">for example because we know if someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.570" end="00:26:09.050" style="s2">claims to be able to cure cancer someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.700" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">is gonna be desperate enough to go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.050" end="00:26:16.100" style="s2">them like their I&#39;m interested as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:18.350" style="s2">are you a free speech absolutist or if</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:21.590" style="s2">not what is it this feels like an</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.350" end="00:26:25.790" style="s2">impossible algorithm to me so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.590" end="00:26:27.920" style="s2">problem is is that it shifts the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.790" end="00:26:29.450" style="s2">limit on freedom of speech anyone I</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.920" end="00:26:32.150" style="s2">agree with it in incitement</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.450" end="00:26:36.050" style="s2">but incitement has to have an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.150" end="00:26:37.460" style="s2">a specific definition and it does by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.050" end="00:26:40.430" style="s2">way in law I mean it&#39;s not impossible</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.460" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">this the incitement laws in a country</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.430" end="00:26:46.910" style="s2">like Britain a pretty good I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:50.360" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t go to prison or be</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.910" end="00:26:54.350" style="s2">prosecuted for saying I think X person</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.360" end="00:26:58.340" style="s2">should die it might be an unwise use of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.350" end="00:27:00.140" style="s2">words unkind use of words but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.340" end="00:27:02.690" style="s2">the same thing as standing with a mob</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.140" end="00:27:04.040" style="s2">outside person&#39;s house and saying to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.690" end="00:27:06.740" style="s2">mob go get them</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.040" end="00:27:09.530" style="s2">that&#39;s incitement that&#39;s incitement and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.740" end="00:27:11.180" style="s2">and the law recognizes that is not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.530" end="00:27:14.030" style="s2">not impossible not starting from year</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.180" end="00:27:15.740" style="s2">zero in any of this country again to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.030" end="00:27:19.810" style="s2">expectations of a lot of people who seem</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.740" end="00:27:22.460" style="s2">to go and work at YouTube and Google and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.810" end="00:27:24.290" style="s2">so that is where I draw the line I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.460" end="00:27:27.560" style="s2">that the very interesting one on cures</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.290" end="00:27:31.820" style="s2">which you raise is is tricky because it</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.560" end="00:27:34.040" style="s2">comes close to that doesn&#39;t it i I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.820" end="00:27:38.210" style="s2">to say I can&#39;t deny I have a certain</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.050" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.370" end="00:27:50.900" style="s2">you know the very beginning of this</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.380" end="00:29:43.130" style="s2">about on which which is very alarming is</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.770" end="00:29:47.690" style="s2">this one this one of the ike thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.130" end="00:29:49.130" style="s2">because you know i I said it some of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.690" end="00:29:51.650" style="s2">other day when they drop this subject up</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.130" end="00:29:55.400" style="s2">but when I was interviewed by the man</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.650" end="00:29:58.850" style="s2">from London real who had liked and an</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.400" end="00:30:00.410" style="s2">interesting interview he mentioned David</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.850" end="00:30:02.060" style="s2">Icke to me he said oh that seems I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.410" end="00:30:03.890" style="s2">David Icke you know David Icke said to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.060" end="00:30:06.050" style="s2">me recent and I sort of you know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.890" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">you know I mean I that yeah and I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.050" end="00:30:10.070" style="s2">thought I never been to the station I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.410" style="s2">seen it but I thought what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.070" end="00:30:15.920" style="s2">in between David Icke yeah I have no</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.410" end="00:30:18.560" style="s2">interest in the man who I last saw I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.920" end="00:30:22.520" style="s2">think on whoa good wasn&#39;t it declaring</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.560" end="00:30:23.870" style="s2">himself to be Jesus I don&#39;t keep a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.520" end="00:30:26.840" style="s2">close eye on people once they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.870" end="00:30:31.790" style="s2">declared themselves to be Jesus I turn</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.840" end="00:30:35.330" style="s2">away and so somebody citing some of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.790" end="00:30:38.270" style="s2">now but again it&#39;s to do with a it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.330" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">do not just with the issue of platforms</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.270" end="00:30:46.010" style="s2">it&#39;s to do with societal health the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:48.920" style="s2">problem is that at some level we periods</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.010" end="00:30:51.830" style="s2">like this show up how healthy or not our</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.920" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">fort is and I think it&#39;s done pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.830" end="00:30:56.900" style="s2">well I think that by and large British</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:59.000" style="s2">society and other that we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.900" end="00:31:03.560" style="s2">go to David Icke for Corona</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.000" end="00:31:07.010" style="s2">advice but there is this issue of what</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.560" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">if at a at a moment equivalent to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.010" end="00:31:12.440" style="s2">person standing outside the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:18.010" style="s2">house saying go get them at a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.440" end="00:31:22.730" style="s2">real international and a national crisis</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.010" end="00:31:25.580" style="s2">somebody is flogging an idea like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.730" end="00:31:28.730" style="s2">know the one that Ike was about five G</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.580" end="00:31:32.810" style="s2">masts and so on and and what if that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.730" end="00:31:35.090" style="s2">does lead to people laying those cables</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.810" end="00:31:38.510" style="s2">being attacked and things being burnt</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.090" end="00:31:39.860" style="s2">down those are things we see throughout</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.510" end="00:31:41.480" style="s2">history and they happen all the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.860" end="00:31:43.850" style="s2">during epidemics and periods where</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.480" end="00:31:45.800" style="s2">people are frightened and I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.850" end="00:31:48.200" style="s2">got faith that they can be countered I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.800" end="00:31:50.360" style="s2">don&#39;t think we need anything wildly</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.200" end="00:31:53.480" style="s2">authoritarian about that I just I</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.360" end="00:31:55.220" style="s2">genuinely don&#39;t think that if David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.480" end="00:31:56.540" style="s2">is put into a discussion with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.220" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">who knows what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.540" end="00:32:03.170" style="s2">that he can win I think there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:06.830" style="s2">chance of it I think he&#39;s a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.170" end="00:32:09.410" style="s2">slight ill health that somebody with his</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:12.170" style="s2">track record could in any way catch on</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.410" end="00:32:14.660" style="s2">at a time like this I agree and I kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.170" end="00:32:17.450" style="s2">of veer between so there&#39;s also it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.660" end="00:32:21.950" style="s2">just I there&#39;s also various other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.450" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">that are saying the same things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.950" end="00:32:25.820" style="s2">getting more like fringe medical figures</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:27.500" style="s2">for example who are getting a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.820" end="00:32:32.120" style="s2">prominent saying certain things about</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.500" end="00:32:34.160" style="s2">the virus being a hoax or and my my</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.120" end="00:32:35.900" style="s2">concern about that if I from from this</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.160" end="00:32:39.770" style="s2">side my concern is that they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.900" end="00:32:42.050" style="s2">within kind of self-enclosed ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.770" end="00:32:44.810" style="s2">with no accountability sure this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.050" end="00:32:47.780" style="s2">dynamic of the fact that we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.810" end="00:32:49.940" style="s2">a system where with fewer media channels</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.780" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">the accountability worked because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.940" end="00:32:54.680" style="s2">had a certain number of media channels</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">you have a certain number of voices they</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.680" end="00:32:58.130" style="s2">would be held to account now it seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:01.160" style="s2">it&#39;s possible for these completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.130" end="00:33:04.400" style="s2">self-enclosed bubbles to exist when no</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.160" end="00:33:06.950" style="s2">one has to face a contrary position no</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.400" end="00:33:09.020" style="s2">one has to face a tough interviewer am i</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.950" end="00:33:11.210" style="s2">worried that that dynamic just seems to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.020" end="00:33:12.830" style="s2">be accelerating that we&#39;ve lost any kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.210" end="00:33:14.390" style="s2">of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.830" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">accountability I think that&#39;s my concern</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.390" end="00:33:18.230" style="s2">but I don&#39;t but over there between</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:20.360" style="s2">thinking that&#39;s a real huge problem and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.230" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">between thinking well actually that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.360" end="00:33:24.950" style="s2">not going to influence that many people</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:26.360" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re right to be concerned</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.950" end="00:33:29.690" style="s2">about it and I think there are times</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.360" end="00:33:33.080" style="s2">when that concern feels more alive than</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.690" end="00:33:36.019" style="s2">at others and I think a few weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.080" end="00:33:37.940" style="s2">you know and actually in certain places</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.019" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">now with people trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.940" end="00:33:41.630" style="s2">breaking lock downs and all that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:44.269" style="s2">something you can feel population being</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.630" end="00:33:47.710" style="s2">becoming restive we can all feel that a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.269" end="00:33:50.889" style="s2">restless rather we can all feel that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.710" end="00:33:53.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve no doubt that there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.889" end="00:33:57.559" style="s2">movements and individuals who take</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.480" end="00:33:59.990" style="s2">advantage of that and there will be</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.559" end="00:34:03.559" style="s2">misinformation and disinformation passed</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.990" end="00:34:06.380" style="s2">around I&#39;m not as worried about it at</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.559" end="00:34:08.839" style="s2">the moment as I say I am worried if</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.380" end="00:34:12.919" style="s2">there is a massive reputational hit</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.839" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">taken by experts deservedly because</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.919" end="00:34:18.109" style="s2">that&#39;s when people go elsewhere but a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:21.409" style="s2">lot of this also is people in having fun</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.780" end="00:35:25.730" style="s2">decades we&#39;ve had it for centuries we</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.330" end="00:35:26.540" style="s2">have been through all of this argument</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.220" end="00:35:56.420" style="s2">all again this kind of Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.250" end="00:35:57.740" style="s2">exceptionalism as well the sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.420" end="00:35:59.660" style="s2">that these are problems no one&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.740" end="00:36:01.910" style="s2">dealt with before that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.660" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">because so many of the people working</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.910" end="00:36:11.090" style="s2">there are kids and and have no knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.250" end="00:36:13.340" style="s2">of history and think that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.090" end="00:36:15.710" style="s2">some unique place and now I mean I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.340" end="00:36:18.530" style="s2">I&#39;m glad you watched the the London real</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.660" end="00:36:28.940" style="s2">about is I&#39;m seeing so I put out my</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.140" end="00:36:30.710" style="s2">pieces I think one other one other</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.940" end="00:36:31.850" style="s2">YouTube channel kind of picked up when</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.710" end="00:36:33.770" style="s2">it has been doing sort of regular</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.770" end="00:36:39.890" style="s2">last day or two especially is a real</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.080" end="00:36:41.690" style="s2">turning of his audience against sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.890" end="00:36:44.360" style="s2">at least a questioning in the comments</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.690" end="00:36:47.390" style="s2">that it seems that that kind of immune</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.360" end="00:36:49.460" style="s2">response seems to be working yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.390" end="00:36:50.810" style="s2">made Emilia allegedly made a million</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.180" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">month to keep it running and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.420" end="00:37:03.530" style="s2">to have kind of sent him over the edge</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:05.240" style="s2">with his own audience so so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.530" end="00:37:06.830" style="s2">seeing now I think here is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.240" end="00:37:08.600" style="s2">immune response or at least this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.830" end="00:37:11.420" style="s2">accountability starting to kick in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.600" end="00:37:13.640" style="s2">more yes and I think that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.420" end="00:37:15.080" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect healthy it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.640" end="00:37:18.020" style="s2">before it&#39;ll happen again</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.080" end="00:37:20.570" style="s2">there&#39;ll be lots of people who try to to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.020" end="00:37:25.670" style="s2">use you know the opportunity to do a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.570" end="00:37:27.860" style="s2">sort of bank raid and and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.670" end="00:37:30.470" style="s2">think that their readers their consumers</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.860" end="00:37:33.260" style="s2">their followers will resent it just as</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.470" end="00:37:35.810" style="s2">much as when that has happened with</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.260" end="00:37:38.130" style="s2">older media I don&#39;t see it in any way</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.810" end="00:37:39.989" style="s2">being that new</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.130" end="00:37:42.799" style="s2">are there any other issues that came up</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.989" end="00:37:46.140" style="s2">from that piece that these thought work</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.799" end="00:37:48.509" style="s2">well I think I think that that central</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.140" end="00:37:54.630" style="s2">thing you&#39;re over you&#39;re over in it</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.509" end="00:37:56.729" style="s2">which is how we agree on how we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.630" end="00:38:00.509" style="s2">agree on what is true in the current era</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.729" end="00:38:01.529" style="s2">is is the is one of the central is one</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.509" end="00:38:03.869" style="s2">of the central issues and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.529" end="00:38:06.180" style="s2">problem which you&#39;ve seen and I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.869" end="00:38:09.619" style="s2">firsthand with the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.180" end="00:38:12.839" style="s2">which is to do with the issue of balance</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.619" end="00:38:15.150" style="s2">the massive risk that goes on at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.839" end="00:38:17.849" style="s2">moment is that everything that is known</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.150" end="00:38:19.739" style="s2">to be true is also known to have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.849" end="00:38:22.579" style="s2">counterbalance and that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.739" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">counterbalance is given equal weight and</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.579" end="00:38:28.529" style="s2">this is this is a great concern it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:30.380" style="s2">great concern scientific community it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.529" end="00:38:34.470" style="s2">a great concern as far than in every</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.380" end="00:38:37.650" style="s2">thinking community and the internet</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.470" end="00:38:40.499" style="s2">definitely makes that tough because of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.650" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">the enormous ease with which people can</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.499" end="00:38:47.219" style="s2">access things I let me give you one</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:51.029" style="s2">example in an area I know a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.219" end="00:38:53.519" style="s2">about there are people on the American</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.029" end="00:38:56.700" style="s2">right very reprehensible figures the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.519" end="00:39:00.630" style="s2">Louvre and figures who have been playing</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.700" end="00:39:02.789" style="s2">with claims that for instance you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.630" end="00:39:05.489" style="s2">to talk about the Holocaust and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.789" end="00:39:09.019" style="s2">question it is to bring incredible risk</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.489" end="00:39:09.019" style="s2">and danger to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.390" end="00:39:14.819" style="s2">I reckon that those people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.019" end="00:39:16.410" style="s2">have a little bit of a run with some</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.819" end="00:39:19.349" style="s2">people particularly very ignorant people</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.410" end="00:39:22.739" style="s2">very young people who have been told</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.349" end="00:39:24.989" style="s2">about the Holocaust and then go online</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.739" end="00:39:28.499" style="s2">and see some things that tell them</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.989" end="00:39:32.009" style="s2">there&#39;s another story and then they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.499" end="00:39:33.960" style="s2">trying to weigh this up and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.009" end="00:39:38.009" style="s2">seriously think but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.960" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">counter-argument you know and if that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.009" end="00:39:45.210" style="s2">can happen with something that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:47.099" style="s2">the most provable things in history then</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.210" end="00:39:50.470" style="s2">you can bet it&#39;s the case with things</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.099" end="00:39:54.430" style="s2">that are much less common knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.470" end="00:39:56.770" style="s2">and and and that is that is a that is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.430" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">massive issue and again how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.770" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">divorce that from the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:05.470" style="s2">going for the lols you know sick as that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:07.690" style="s2">is because there will there is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.470" end="00:40:08.859" style="s2">and a lot of the reprehensible stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.690" end="00:40:12.040" style="s2">that happens online there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.859" end="00:40:14.530" style="s2">significant amount of that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.040" end="00:40:17.050" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve probably both have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.530" end="00:40:19.210" style="s2">similar sense of I mean some people call</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.050" end="00:40:22.869" style="s2">it the sense making crisis I quite like</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.210" end="00:40:25.720" style="s2">that word like what is true seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.869" end="00:40:28.090" style="s2">I don&#39;t if you de Greve it to me at</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.720" end="00:40:29.890" style="s2">least feels like the if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.090" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">generator function of many of the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.890" end="00:40:33.160" style="s2">problems that we&#39;re seeing cascading</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:34.750" style="s2">through society that one seems to be at</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.160" end="00:40:36.099" style="s2">the core I remember something you said</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.750" end="00:40:38.109" style="s2">in that first interview which I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.099" end="00:40:41.619" style="s2">was a really great way of summing it up</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.109" end="00:40:44.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like we cannot imagine not only can</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.619" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2">we not imagine kind of a way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.200" end="00:40:49.420" style="s2">addressing these truth claims we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:51.820" style="s2">even conceive of who that might be like</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.420" end="00:40:54.460" style="s2">yeah who could possibly have that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.820" end="00:40:58.839" style="s2">authority to make those judgments which</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.460" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see a way out</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.839" end="00:41:02.140" style="s2">I don&#39;t see an obvious way out of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">kind of spiral we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.140" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">concentrate on doing it as well as we</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:08.770" style="s2">can and as hygienically as we can in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:12.040" style="s2">areas we know most about oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.770" end="00:41:13.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where you start and by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.040" end="00:41:17.130" style="s2">way another one which I try to practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.750" end="00:41:21.930" style="s2">myself but is is not to enter the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.130" end="00:41:26.890" style="s2">speculation in an area if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.930" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">just keep out of it don&#39;t you know not</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.890" end="00:41:34.150" style="s2">everyone has to say everything out loud</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:37.150" style="s2">all the time there&#39;s a rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.150" end="00:41:39.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not popular of course it it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.150" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t awful lot of good if you admit</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:47.890" style="s2">the nature of a conundrum out loud one</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t think has got enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.890" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">attention in recent years is the extent</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:56.890" style="s2">to which no public discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:59.460" style="s2">genuinely taking us forward on main</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.890" end="00:42:02.330" style="s2">platforms and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.460" end="00:42:05.490" style="s2">genuinely worried about this that no</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.940" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">that the reason is that that&#39;s not the</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.619" end="00:43:29.260" style="s2">of having the vicious vicious nasty</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.310" end="00:43:51.369" style="s2">the discussion on yeah actually there</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.530" end="00:43:53.349" style="s2">are there are competing virtues and</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.349" end="00:43:57.460" style="s2">rubble on well they rub against each</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:43:59.530" style="s2">other quite nicely and aggressively in</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.470" end="00:45:27.010" style="s2">we never get forward on these things why</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.230" end="00:45:29.290" style="s2">don&#39;t we solve anything and and I I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.570" end="00:45:45.720" style="s2">mean this covers it sort of like the</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.300" end="00:48:51.240" style="s2">I try to keep it in some kind of context</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.200" end="00:48:53.640" style="s2">but maybe all of the time what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.240" end="00:48:56.070" style="s2">happening is that we are attributing to</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:25.230" style="s2">more confusing where we will need good</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.320" end="00:50:27.690" style="s2">sense making equipment and we&#39;ll need</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.230" end="00:50:29.970" style="s2">some amount of trust even more than</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.690" end="00:50:32.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve needed it in the weeks leading up</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.970" end="00:50:33.240" style="s2">to now yeah thank you Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.010" end="00:50:36.990" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use this for a very clumsy</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.240" end="00:50:38.340" style="s2">segue to to mention but all of that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.990" end="00:50:39.000" style="s2">just opened up is really really</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.340" end="00:50:41.310" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.000" end="00:50:43.140" style="s2">like we&#39;ve been kind of drilling down</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.310" end="00:50:46.710" style="s2">into that like the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.140" end="00:50:48.300" style="s2">dimension why why certain parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.710" end="00:50:51.030" style="s2">system are activated by these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.300" end="00:50:52.230" style="s2">arguments I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.030" end="00:50:54.270" style="s2">getting through it without at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.230" end="00:50:56.970" style="s2">understanding kind of some of our basic</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.270" end="00:50:59.340" style="s2">kind of wiring evolutionary wiring to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.970" end="00:51:02.190" style="s2">see to see kind of threats for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.340" end="00:51:04.650" style="s2">and an understanding that sense making</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.190" end="00:51:06.420" style="s2">is gonna like real sense making is going</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.650" end="00:51:07.590" style="s2">to involve some kind of trust and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.420" end="00:51:10.620" style="s2">going to involve some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.590" end="00:51:13.710" style="s2">vulnerability or at least a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.620" end="00:51:17.580" style="s2">being created for the discussions well</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.710" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">but also that thing I mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.580" end="00:51:22.110" style="s2">the absolutely crucial element of making</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:25.230" style="s2">one&#39;s peace with the world to some</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.110" end="00:51:30.360" style="s2">extent and the world as it is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.230" end="00:51:32.820" style="s2">mean accepting that there will be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.360" end="00:51:34.620" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to do this by the way on an</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.820" end="00:51:38.760" style="s2">individual level and a historical level</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.620" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">it is to do it on a sort of species</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.760" end="00:51:44.820" style="s2">level because I think there&#39;s a disjunct</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:48.050" style="s2">I mean maybe this is subject from other</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.820" end="00:51:49.849" style="s2">time there&#39;s a disjunct between</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.050" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">explaining</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.849" end="00:51:58.519" style="s2">to people themselves on those terms and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:52:02.749" style="s2">the manner in which we feel ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.519" end="00:52:06.680" style="s2">be and what I mean by that is if you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.749" end="00:52:14.029" style="s2">to people look we are we are hard-wired</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.680" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">to follow this sort of behavior it is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.029" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">can be both true and inadequate to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:23.690" style="s2">explain ourselves in the manner which we</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:27.349" style="s2">experience ourselves in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.690" end="00:52:28.940" style="s2">living so we might for instance think</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.349" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">well I know that&#39;s the case with other</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.940" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">people but it&#39;s not the case with me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:35.660" style="s2">and there&#39;s something in that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:37.609" style="s2">disjunct that I think is interesting a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.660" end="00:52:39.979" style="s2">friend of mine use a prison doctor for</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.609" end="00:52:42.469" style="s2">many years made the very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.979" end="00:52:44.690" style="s2">observation some years ago that he spoke</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.469" end="00:52:46.670" style="s2">to prisoner after prisoner who said that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.690" end="00:52:48.769" style="s2">they had fallen into the wrong crowd and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.670" end="00:52:50.420" style="s2">although he met so many people had</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.769" end="00:52:55.219" style="s2">fallen into the wrong crowd he never met</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.420" end="00:52:58.309" style="s2">the crowd and and just as people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.219" end="00:53:03.049" style="s2">say I was the crowd that other people</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.309" end="00:53:07.400" style="s2">fell into so when you explained the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.049" end="00:53:10.900" style="s2">in which we behave on a kind of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.400" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">level there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.900" end="00:53:18.140" style="s2">there&#39;s something that is is missed</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:21.499" style="s2">which is why as I say I&#39;m much more fond</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.140" end="00:53:23.239" style="s2">of explaining it in a way in historical</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.499" end="00:53:28.940" style="s2">terms or saying no these are the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.239" end="00:53:31.880" style="s2">that have always been with us and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.940" end="00:53:33.380" style="s2">then to an extent making your peace with</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.880" end="00:53:34.910" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.380" end="00:53:38.170" style="s2">about it but it means you have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.910" end="00:53:41.049" style="s2">reasonable a reasonable approach to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.170" end="00:53:43.219" style="s2">things that you can&#39;t do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.049" end="00:53:45.349" style="s2">you know you&#39;ll never you&#39;ll never get</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.219" end="00:53:48.109" style="s2">rid of the hucksters completely you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.349" end="00:53:51.499" style="s2">never get rid of the wires and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.109" end="00:53:53.900" style="s2">never get the world without hate no so</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.499" end="00:53:58.339" style="s2">have have reasonable aspirations it</p>
