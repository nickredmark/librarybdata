<p begin="00:00:05.910" end="00:00:11.709" style="s2">so it feels really interesting to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.290" end="00:00:13.269" style="s2">here because we&#39;ve featured on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.709" end="00:00:15.039" style="s2">channel quite a lot the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.269" end="00:00:17.349" style="s2">dark web and it feels like this is one</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.039" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">of the places that gave birth to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.349" end="00:00:22.750" style="s2">intellectual dark web as a as a thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:24.400" style="s2">what do you make of the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.750" end="00:00:26.019" style="s2">dark web as it was and where do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.400" end="00:00:28.210" style="s2">think it is now sort of maybe a year</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.019" end="00:00:30.220" style="s2">after its first emerged yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.210" end="00:00:32.259" style="s2">guess if there&#39;s a physical center of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.220" end="00:00:34.420" style="s2">the intellectual dark web it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.259" end="00:00:37.660" style="s2">here I mean it&#39;s in my garage because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.420" end="00:00:39.670" style="s2">think this is where not where the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.660" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">all started but at least where most of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.670" end="00:00:43.450" style="s2">the connections between the people</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.440" end="00:00:45.550" style="s2">started and you know people ask me my</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.450" end="00:00:47.290" style="s2">role in this whole thing and whether it</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.550" end="00:00:50.350" style="s2">is a thing at all you know whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.290" end="00:00:52.090" style="s2">some sort of card-carrying organization</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.350" end="00:00:54.700" style="s2">or it&#39;s this loose affiliation or</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.090" end="00:00:57.010" style="s2">whatever it is I think my role in it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.700" end="00:00:59.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a little bit of the connective</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.010" end="00:01:02.320" style="s2">tissue between the people because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.410" end="00:01:05.650" style="s2">not a biologist like Brett Weinstein or</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:08.440" style="s2">Heather Heying I&#39;m not an economist like</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.650" end="00:01:10.810" style="s2">his brother Eric Weinstein I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.440" end="00:01:12.940" style="s2">psychologist like Jordan and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.810" end="00:01:14.590" style="s2">the list goes on and on but I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.940" end="00:01:16.930" style="s2">interviewer or at least I&#39;ve become an</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.590" end="00:01:18.340" style="s2">interviewer and for whatever reason over</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.930" end="00:01:20.170" style="s2">the course of the couple years that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.340" end="00:01:22.420" style="s2">been doing this as someone that came</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.170" end="00:01:25.270" style="s2">from the left I started seeing all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.420" end="00:01:27.850" style="s2">these issues related to free speech and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.270" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">open inquiry and the constant labeling</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.850" end="00:01:31.390" style="s2">of everyone else as a bigot and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:33.670" style="s2">homophobe and a racist than the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.390" end="00:01:35.740" style="s2">it I started talking about that from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.670" end="00:01:37.510" style="s2">leftie perspective and and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.740" end="00:01:39.220" style="s2">interesting because a lot of the IDW we</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.510" end="00:01:41.080" style="s2">get labeled like we&#39;re somehow all right</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.220" end="00:01:43.810" style="s2">wing or were conservatives or something</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.080" end="00:01:45.610" style="s2">like that most of these people at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.810" end="00:01:46.780" style="s2">were lefties and I think most of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.610" end="00:01:50.500" style="s2">actually still consider themselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.780" end="00:01:52.270" style="s2">lefties to some extent so I started</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.500" end="00:01:53.620" style="s2">talking about these issues and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.270" end="00:01:55.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in a couple studio since we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.620" end="00:01:56.740" style="s2">started this show so I originally</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.390" end="00:01:59.320" style="s2">started the show at aura TV which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.740" end="00:02:01.060" style="s2">Larry King&#39;s digital network then we we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.320" end="00:02:03.670" style="s2">left there for a little bit and we did</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.060" end="00:02:05.260" style="s2">the show at I can say this now I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.670" end="00:02:07.720" style="s2">say it for a long time I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.260" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">renting Roseanne Barr studio in LA</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.720" end="00:02:13.209" style="s2">before the whole the Twitter fiasco and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:14.440" style="s2">all that and then eventually we started</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.209" end="00:02:16.450" style="s2">doing it here in my home</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.440" end="00:02:20.320" style="s2">about two and a half years ago now and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.450" end="00:02:23.830" style="s2">think because I came from the left I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.320" end="00:02:26.620" style="s2">uniquely positioned to talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.830" end="00:02:29.500" style="s2">issues with the right people in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.620" end="00:02:31.390" style="s2">that would get lefties who were going</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.500" end="00:02:34.420" style="s2">wait what has happened to liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.390" end="00:02:36.670" style="s2">what has happened to free expression I</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.420" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">was uniquely positioned to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.670" end="00:02:41.470" style="s2">talk about it in an open way so if there</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.700" end="00:02:43.150" style="s2">is a center I suppose it&#39;s here the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:44.170" style="s2">center is not too far also of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:46.240" style="s2">from Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.170" end="00:02:48.460" style="s2">studio and just any of these people that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.240" end="00:02:50.860" style="s2">are that are openly and honestly willing</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.460" end="00:02:51.940" style="s2">to engage in ideas to sit across from</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.860" end="00:02:54.010" style="s2">somebody and look them in the eye and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.940" end="00:02:56.140" style="s2">figure out what do they think how does</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.010" end="00:02:57.820" style="s2">that match up against what you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.140" end="00:02:59.980" style="s2">what don&#39;t you know what does someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.820" end="00:03:01.660" style="s2">know that you don&#39;t know sometimes I sit</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.980" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">across from somebody who it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.660" end="00:03:04.540" style="s2">obvious to me they&#39;re not really a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:07.300" style="s2">master of their thoughts and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.540" end="00:03:10.540" style="s2">something because of that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.300" end="00:03:13.720" style="s2">so whatever the IDW is and whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.540" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2">may become I&#39;m very proud I think if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:18.280" style="s2">do nothing else you know in the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:21.580" style="s2">my career or a professional life like we</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.280" end="00:03:24.040" style="s2">created something partly in this room</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.580" end="00:03:26.020" style="s2">that has woke people up around the globe</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.040" end="00:03:27.520" style="s2">I mean I just did you know basically a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.020" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">year on the road with Jordan Peters and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.520" end="00:03:30.910" style="s2">a hundred twenty plus stops all over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:34.030" style="s2">world you know from Sweden and Denmark</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.910" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">to you know to right here in California</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.030" end="00:03:39.459" style="s2">to Canada to wherever and it&#39;s like wow</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:42.730" style="s2">people real people not just Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.459" end="00:03:44.320" style="s2">trolls and Russian BOTS are waking up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.730" end="00:03:47.470" style="s2">some of these ideas and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.320" end="00:03:50.350" style="s2">incredibly cool and I guess why I really</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.470" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">identified with with this as well is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.350" end="00:03:55.570" style="s2">that I sort of also have also done</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:56.650" style="s2">identified myself as a leftist and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.570" end="00:03:59.170" style="s2">feeling sort of more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.650" end="00:04:01.330" style="s2">politically homeless as time has gone on</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.170" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">and kind of feeling that the the left is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.330" end="00:04:06.070" style="s2">kind of going off in a direction that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">I&#39;m not comfortable with and but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.070" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">intellectual dart web has always been</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:12.310" style="s2">like some of the most exciting</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">conversations were for example Ben</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.310" end="00:04:16.390" style="s2">Shapiro and Jordan Peterson talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">about religious truth and just having</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.390" end="00:04:20.500" style="s2">the sort of sense of an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.830" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">conversation going somewhere into an</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.500" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">area that&#39;s way beyond politics do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:27.580" style="s2">see it as primarily a political thing or</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:28.449" style="s2">do you think that it&#39;s it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.580" end="00:04:29.740" style="s2">bigger conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.449" end="00:04:32.199" style="s2">oh I think it&#39;s a much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.740" end="00:04:33.639" style="s2">conversation I think it&#39;s cultural first</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.199" end="00:04:35.889" style="s2">and you know sort of the meme out there</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.639" end="00:04:37.270" style="s2">right now is that politics is downstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.889" end="00:04:38.259" style="s2">from culture that&#39;s what everyone&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.270" end="00:04:41.409" style="s2">of saying I think Andrew Breitbart</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.259" end="00:04:43.779" style="s2">originally said that but it really is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.409" end="00:04:45.849" style="s2">true so for example the the one that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.779" end="00:04:49.029" style="s2">you&#39;re referencing when I had Shapiro in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.849" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">here with Peterson we didn&#39;t really plan</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.029" end="00:04:53.979" style="s2">anything I said I said Ben I got Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:55.389" style="s2">in studio Ben&#39;s not too far from here</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.979" end="00:04:56.889" style="s2">I said if you got an hour why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.389" end="00:04:58.569" style="s2">swing by and let&#39;s just see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.889" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">now I knew there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.569" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">discussion to be had there here you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.180" style="s2">Jordan Peterson who I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:06.219" style="s2">leading intellectual of our time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.180" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">after being on tour with the guy I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.219" end="00:05:11.349" style="s2">to say I&#39;m in awe of him is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:13.779" style="s2">doing it justice I mean the guy is truly</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.349" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">the real deal but here&#39;s someone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.779" end="00:05:21.009" style="s2">talks you know does these biblical</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.830" end="00:05:23.110" style="s2">lectures really has has awoken a let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.009" end="00:05:26.199" style="s2">say a religious spirit not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.110" end="00:05:28.270" style="s2">for people to become religious per se</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.199" end="00:05:30.759" style="s2">but he has woken up something related to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:33.639" style="s2">belief in a lot of young people and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.759" end="00:05:35.409" style="s2">lot of end people all ages and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.639" end="00:05:37.180" style="s2">Ben Shapiro who comes from a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.409" end="00:05:38.889" style="s2">Orthodox Jewish background I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.180" end="00:05:41.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a great discussion to be had</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.889" end="00:05:43.959" style="s2">here and what I think I can do in those</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.139" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">conversations is I can kind of throw the</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:50.589" style="s2">then there are moments and I think there</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.370" end="00:05:52.629" style="s2">was a particular moment in that sit-down</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.589" end="00:05:54.249" style="s2">where they&#39;re going you know and Ben&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.629" end="00:05:55.330" style="s2">talking really fast and Jordans doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.249" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">everything with his hands and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.330" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">there&#39;s so many big ideas happening and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:05:59.889" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.360" end="00:06:02.379" style="s2">things and there&#39;s a moment where I say</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.889" end="00:06:03.879" style="s2">guys guys we got to get this to a place</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.379" end="00:06:05.919" style="s2">where the average person can have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.879" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">little more understanding because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.919" end="00:06:09.069" style="s2">what I consider myself like I have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:12.310" style="s2">good handle on these ideas obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.069" end="00:06:13.810" style="s2">I I lived this and I breathe it and but</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.310" end="00:06:15.189" style="s2">when I&#39;m watching these things happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.810" end="00:06:17.229" style="s2">I&#39;m also watching a little bit as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.189" end="00:06:18.999" style="s2">viewer myself and there was a moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.229" end="00:06:20.649" style="s2">where it was getting so high wire I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.999" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">like okay we what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.649" end="00:06:25.240" style="s2">is we&#39;re taking some really eternal</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:26.889" style="s2">messages about belief and truth and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.240" end="00:06:28.419" style="s2">of these things that a lot of people can</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.889" end="00:06:29.979" style="s2">understand but now we&#39;re taken to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.419" end="00:06:31.029" style="s2">place where if we keep going it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.979" end="00:06:32.589" style="s2">people are gonna send less people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.029" end="00:06:34.149" style="s2">saying and then there&#39;s only to be one</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.589" end="00:06:35.259" style="s2">guy I understand and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.149" end="00:06:37.719" style="s2">know who that&#39;s gonna be at is that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.259" end="00:06:39.219" style="s2">one criticism is that you&#39;re not an</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.719" end="00:06:40.269" style="s2">intellectual well I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.219" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">for me to say whether I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.269" end="00:06:43.500" style="s2">intellectual or not I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:45.000" style="s2">and I understand these ideas I love</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.500" end="00:06:46.979" style="s2">learning I mean I more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.000" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">else if I&#39;ve done anything right in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.979" end="00:06:51.509" style="s2">life it&#39;s that every week I get to sit</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:54.150" style="s2">down across from somebody who&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.509" end="00:06:55.889" style="s2">something interesting to say some people</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.150" end="00:06:57.180" style="s2">are far more interesting than others I</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.889" end="00:06:59.220" style="s2">don&#39;t think that makes me an</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.180" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">intellectual per se I mean you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.220" end="00:07:03.419" style="s2">come from a stand-up comedy background I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">like interviewing people I like public</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.419" end="00:07:08.490" style="s2">speaking or all of those things I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:10.620" style="s2">think it really matters I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.490" end="00:07:12.150" style="s2">a there&#39;s a certain elite or like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.620" end="00:07:13.470" style="s2">see this where people say oh well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.150" end="00:07:14.940" style="s2">got the psychologist and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.470" end="00:07:16.979" style="s2">harvard-trained lawyer and or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.940" end="00:07:20.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s like and then there&#39;s Ruben and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.979" end="00:07:21.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like all right I am a piece of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.190" end="00:07:23.340" style="s2">you know you mean like I would say a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.569" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">good basketball team you can&#39;t have five</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.340" end="00:07:26.580" style="s2">Michael Jordan&#39;s on the team you need a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:27.900" style="s2">guy that can set picks and you need a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.580" end="00:07:29.580" style="s2">guy that can pass and a guy that can</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.900" end="00:07:30.900" style="s2">score and do all of those things and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.580" end="00:07:33.509" style="s2">need a guy that comes off the bench and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.900" end="00:07:35.370" style="s2">I do think just it&#39;s just my nature I am</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.509" end="00:07:36.930" style="s2">a bit of a team player generally</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.370" end="00:07:39.509" style="s2">speaking so whether I mean whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.930" end="00:07:42.659" style="s2">an intellectual per se or someone that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.509" end="00:07:44.520" style="s2">has a I would say if anything I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.659" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of uncomfortable to do so but</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.520" end="00:07:49.289" style="s2">I would say if anything I think I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:51.389" style="s2">communicator of ideas so not all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.289" end="00:07:53.580" style="s2">these ideas have all just magically</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.389" end="00:07:55.319" style="s2">appear I chose well probably yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.580" end="00:07:57.300" style="s2">would say I would say communicator and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.319" end="00:07:59.639" style="s2">and for the purposes of the show itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.300" end="00:08:03.000" style="s2">the curator is the right way to describe</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.639" end="00:08:05.069" style="s2">it because all I did when this show</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.000" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">started was I started talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.069" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">I was thinking there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:11.729" style="s2">with the left it&#39;s loosely related to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:14.219" style="s2">free speech are there other ways that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.729" end="00:08:16.650" style="s2">good decent liberals can get their goals</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.219" end="00:08:18.719" style="s2">accomplished of say equality gay</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.650" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">marriage things like that that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.719" end="00:08:22.349" style="s2">have to do with government intervention</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:24.060" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that opened me a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.349" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">bit more to some libertarian views and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.060" end="00:08:27.960" style="s2">that really was how I was able to truly</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">understand what classical liberalism is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:30.990" style="s2">and the fact that I you know even the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">phrase classical liberalism that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:34.589" style="s2">even spoke of now it is a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:37.020" style="s2">something to do with something that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.589" end="00:08:38.579" style="s2">did right here in this room so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.020" end="00:08:40.589" style="s2">proud of that and whether whether I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.579" end="00:08:42.029" style="s2">intellectual or a guy that&#39;s sitting</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.589" end="00:08:43.649" style="s2">across from these people in curating</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.029" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">some of these ideas or communicating</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.649" end="00:08:46.950" style="s2">some of these ideas or whatever that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">I don&#39;t even think that really matters</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.950" end="00:08:52.050" style="s2">and it almost is not it&#39;s just not for</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:53.970" style="s2">me to say I&#39;m just I&#39;m really just doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.050" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">what I think is right and I&#39;m thrilled</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.970" end="00:08:58.780" style="s2">to be part</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:09:00.550" style="s2">of whatever this is really and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.780" end="00:09:03.610" style="s2">this is happening in an American context</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.550" end="00:09:05.170" style="s2">where we&#39;re based in the UK so and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:10.180" style="s2">think probably about 50% of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.170" end="00:09:11.710" style="s2">audiences is us but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.180" end="00:09:13.570" style="s2">fascinating to see so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.710" end="00:09:15.910" style="s2">exposed to the American conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.570" end="00:09:18.400" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s happening at so much</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.910" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">of a fever pitch compared to how it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.400" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">in the in the UK even where it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:24.910" style="s2">like we&#39;ve brexit especially it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:27.450" style="s2">quite a kind of intense conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.910" end="00:09:29.140" style="s2">there is something about the American</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.450" end="00:09:31.870" style="s2">polarization that just seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.140" end="00:09:34.750" style="s2">ramping up and up and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.870" end="00:09:36.010" style="s2">there the IDW originally was designed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.750" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">be a sort of space beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.010" end="00:09:40.540" style="s2">polarization but it feels that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">very difficult space to hold do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.540" end="00:09:44.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s even possible to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">space in the US so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.890" end="00:09:48.520" style="s2">basically the key question almost for</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:52.540" style="s2">every Western democracy right now is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.520" end="00:09:54.910" style="s2">whether the center or some version of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.540" end="00:09:57.430" style="s2">tolerant middle that can agree to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.910" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">disagree can that hold you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.430" end="00:10:00.340" style="s2">interesting because after being on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">road and visiting all these countries in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.340" end="00:10:05.020" style="s2">the last year you know I was in Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:06.850" style="s2">when the Brett Kavanaugh thing was</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.020" end="00:10:09.310" style="s2">happening and the fact that so many</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.850" end="00:10:11.170" style="s2">people in Ireland after a show and I did</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.310" end="00:10:12.580" style="s2">my meet and greet we&#39;re asking me what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.170" end="00:10:14.080" style="s2">thought about Brett Cavanaugh the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.580" end="00:10:14.440" style="s2">Supreme Court justice in the United</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.080" end="00:10:17.350" style="s2">States</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.440" end="00:10:20.710" style="s2">I thought something feels off to me here</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.350" end="00:10:22.630" style="s2">why would the average person in Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.710" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">not only care about this why would they</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.630" end="00:10:27.400" style="s2">even know about this so in a weird way I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:29.500" style="s2">suppose the United States has almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.400" end="00:10:32.860" style="s2">exported a little bit of our craziness</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.500" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">but that&#39;s just a nature of the way time</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.860" end="00:10:36.130" style="s2">and information operate now I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:38.500" style="s2">all walking around with devices that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.130" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">connect us to the world and right the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">second you know I mean I could send out</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:44.830" style="s2">a tweak right now that would ruin my</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:46.900" style="s2">career you know cause all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.830" end="00:10:48.520" style="s2">repercussions and you guys the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.900" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">thing I mean there&#39;s a lot of power in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.520" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">that and also I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:55.060" style="s2">quite figured out how to grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:10:57.130" style="s2">that power so when when the IDW started</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.060" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">to come together before the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.130" end="00:11:02.500" style="s2">dark web phrase had even been uttered by</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">Eric I think we really were just trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.500" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">I think unknowingly perhaps we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:08.649" style="s2">trying to protect the middle I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:11.439" style="s2">that&#39;s what it was and if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.649" end="00:11:12.850" style="s2">of the original crew of this thing so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.439" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2">you were to take Eric and Brad who I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.850" end="00:11:17.529" style="s2">already mentioned if you took Sam well</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:19.029" style="s2">right there you have three lefties these</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.529" end="00:11:20.139" style="s2">are these are guys who have been on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.029" end="00:11:21.459" style="s2">left their whole life now you could take</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.139" end="00:11:23.379" style="s2">a guy like Ben who obviously is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.459" end="00:11:25.689" style="s2">conservative and you could take Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.379" end="00:11:28.869" style="s2">who say more conservative or more</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.689" end="00:11:30.939" style="s2">traditional some level but we really did</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.869" end="00:11:33.429" style="s2">have people did and do have people all</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.939" end="00:11:36.069" style="s2">over the map and that&#39;s what you should</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.429" end="00:11:39.399" style="s2">want in a free Western society what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.069" end="00:11:41.679" style="s2">want is a lefty like Sam Harris to do be</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.399" end="00:11:44.589" style="s2">to be able to debate the nature of truth</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.679" end="00:11:47.470" style="s2">with a conservative like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.589" end="00:11:49.149" style="s2">and at the end they don&#39;t it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.470" end="00:11:50.470" style="s2">somebody winning although in the day of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.149" end="00:11:51.670" style="s2">internet everyone wants somebody to win</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.470" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">or be destroyed or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.670" end="00:11:56.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s not somebody has to win it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:59.709" style="s2">that they to true intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.319" end="00:12:01.959" style="s2">powerhouses got to debate not only if</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.709" end="00:12:03.579" style="s2">they done it on podcast but they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.959" end="00:12:04.749" style="s2">it in front of live audiences and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.579" end="00:12:06.279" style="s2">they&#39;ve done it in the UK in front of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.749" end="00:12:09.670" style="s2">thousands and thousands of people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.279" end="00:12:11.499" style="s2">they did it several times and in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:13.899" style="s2">Western society it&#39;s like everyone hears</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.499" end="00:12:15.759" style="s2">the debate you then make your choices oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.899" end="00:12:17.980" style="s2">you know Sam did make a good point about</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.759" end="00:12:20.649" style="s2">this but I agree maybe with Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.980" end="00:12:22.420" style="s2">macro view of the world or you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.649" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">eight maybe I&#39;m an atheist personally</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.420" end="00:12:27.490" style="s2">but I see a value of a society being</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:29.829" style="s2">based around judeo-christian values or</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.490" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.829" end="00:12:33.970" style="s2">what you want in the West that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:35.740" style="s2">you want in a free society so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.970" end="00:12:37.839" style="s2">that&#39;s really what we&#39;ve tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.740" end="00:12:40.120" style="s2">there has been no topic that I know of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.839" end="00:12:43.209" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t been able to cover and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.120" end="00:12:45.699" style="s2">agree to disagree or at least shelve the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.209" end="00:12:47.199" style="s2">portion that we that really upsets us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.699" end="00:12:49.660" style="s2">each other so for example in this very</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.199" end="00:12:52.029" style="s2">studio in that chair ben shapiro sat in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.660" end="00:12:54.129" style="s2">that chair which is in my home where he</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.029" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">knows i am married to my husband and he</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.129" end="00:12:58.059" style="s2">has expressed you know that he</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:12:59.679" style="s2">personally through his religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.059" end="00:13:01.209" style="s2">understanding of the world he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.679" end="00:13:02.949" style="s2">thrilled with gay marriage that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.209" end="00:13:05.170" style="s2">light way of putting it but now he takes</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.949" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">a more libertarian approach i can live</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.170" end="00:13:12.819" style="s2">with that i don&#39;t need to somehow impose</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:14.740" style="s2">my view of the world on ben shapiro and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.819" end="00:13:16.779" style="s2">on his religious beliefs what i need is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.740" end="00:13:18.549" style="s2">for him not to impose those beliefs on</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.779" end="00:13:19.220" style="s2">the way i can live and we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.549" end="00:13:22.100" style="s2">there we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.220" end="00:13:24.379" style="s2">there I&#39;m married and he&#39;s not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.100" end="00:13:26.629" style="s2">impose anything on me and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.379" end="00:13:28.009" style="s2">good so that&#39;s like the type of and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.629" end="00:13:29.959" style="s2">guess what we&#39;re doing that in my home</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.009" end="00:13:33.769" style="s2">and this is the same guy who will say he</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.959" end="00:13:35.779" style="s2">won&#39;t come to a an anniversary party at</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.769" end="00:13:38.300" style="s2">my home because he doesn&#39;t in his strict</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.779" end="00:13:40.490" style="s2">religious sense of the world doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.300" end="00:13:42.110" style="s2">approve of my marriage it&#39;s not that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.490" end="00:13:43.819" style="s2">love that I don&#39;t love that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.110" end="00:13:45.019" style="s2">people I see lefties will attack me on</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.819" end="00:13:46.490" style="s2">Twitter I see you&#39;re sitting there with</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.019" end="00:13:48.170" style="s2">this homophobic bigot and bah-bah-bah</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.490" end="00:13:50.779" style="s2">I&#39;m like you know what then and I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.170" end="00:13:53.089" style="s2">much more respect for each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.779" end="00:13:54.920" style="s2">then you guys seem to have for either</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.089" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">one of us and you&#39;re telling us were the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.920" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">intolerant ones meanwhile we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:13:59.240" style="s2">we&#39;re really trying to work through</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:00.379" style="s2">something and I would say more than</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.240" end="00:14:03.439" style="s2">anything else when it comes to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.379" end="00:14:05.269" style="s2">example where this is a true I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.439" end="00:14:08.300" style="s2">is a fundamental like how you live your</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.269" end="00:14:11.480" style="s2">life difference that we have my belief</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.300" end="00:14:12.589" style="s2">is that over time if Ben and I or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.480" end="00:14:13.819" style="s2">that I was having this conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.589" end="00:14:16.069" style="s2">think we can keep having that</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.819" end="00:14:17.509" style="s2">conversation and now I&#39;m a couple years</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.069" end="00:14:20.120" style="s2">older than Ben so now I&#39;m 80 let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.509" end="00:14:22.790" style="s2">and he&#39;s 74 or whatever it is I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.120" end="00:14:24.230" style="s2">that he will have come more along my</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.790" end="00:14:26.899" style="s2">line of thinking in this case than I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.230" end="00:14:28.610" style="s2">will have come to his but there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.899" end="00:14:29.689" style="s2">one way to find out and that&#39;s by not</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.610" end="00:14:31.220" style="s2">killing each other and not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.689" end="00:14:34.550" style="s2">platforming each other in the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.220" end="00:14:35.689" style="s2">so we have to keep doing this and and to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.550" end="00:14:39.110" style="s2">the real point of your question can a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.689" end="00:14:41.779" style="s2">center hold I don&#39;t know but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.110" end="00:14:43.939" style="s2">that&#39;s the most relevant reason why we</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.779" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">need to keep trying we are living in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.939" end="00:14:47.629" style="s2">time when the sides are fraying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:49.009" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about it at the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.629" end="00:14:52.579" style="s2">time what I would say is that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.009" end="00:14:54.470" style="s2">the center the sane center I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.579" end="00:14:56.269" style="s2">maybe that has shifted a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.470" end="00:14:58.309" style="s2">center-right right now because I see</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.269" end="00:14:59.930" style="s2">something very rich happening on what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.309" end="00:15:03.350" style="s2">would call is the center right so sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.930" end="00:15:04.850" style="s2">of conservatives with a more libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.350" end="00:15:06.680" style="s2">bent which I&#39;m definitely seeing from</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.850" end="00:15:08.300" style="s2">young people then you&#39;ve got classical</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.680" end="00:15:10.550" style="s2">liberals you&#39;ve got sort of the X</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.300" end="00:15:12.110" style="s2">lefties who are looking for refuge and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.550" end="00:15:14.059" style="s2">there&#39;s something really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.110" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">happening on the center right and I see</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.059" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">none of that on the left or there is no</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.319" style="s2">center left really anymore there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.970" style="s2">couple stragglers but that&#39;s about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.319" end="00:15:24.889" style="s2">so we have to keep fighting for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.970" end="00:15:27.690" style="s2">ability to do agree to disagree that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.889" end="00:15:30.690" style="s2">that&#39;s all you have in a free society</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.690" end="00:15:32.850" style="s2">and Aki Aki built it but your point</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.690" end="00:15:35.190" style="s2">about whether the center can hold I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.850" end="00:15:38.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s the the most key question</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.190" end="00:15:39.540" style="s2">so on rebel wisdom we don&#39;t really we</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.040" end="00:15:41.820" style="s2">don&#39;t really go down at the political</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">level that often we&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.820" end="00:15:45.960" style="s2">interested in what are the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:48.180" style="s2">meta conversation and the meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.960" end="00:15:49.260" style="s2">conversation for for me if you wanted us</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.180" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">or take it up to a slightly higher level</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.260" end="00:15:52.920" style="s2">which is why I think Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:55.550" style="s2">so interesting because I think he is</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.920" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">coming from this very psychological</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.550" end="00:15:59.400" style="s2">metaphysical level but then that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:03.060" style="s2">ramifications further down in culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.400" end="00:16:06.780" style="s2">and politics but effectively it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.060" end="00:16:09.870" style="s2">something like the the shifts that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.780" end="00:16:11.460" style="s2">saw in the 60s went too far one way and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.870" end="00:16:14.010" style="s2">there was a lot of traditional stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.460" end="00:16:15.510" style="s2">that was basically thrown out the baby</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.010" end="00:16:17.400" style="s2">was thrown out with the bathwater and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.510" end="00:16:19.470" style="s2">the kind of synthesis we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.400" end="00:16:21.480" style="s2">is kind of some of the freedoms that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.470" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen through the 60s but with some</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.480" end="00:16:26.420" style="s2">of the traditional wisdom that actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.700" end="00:16:29.520" style="s2">has a huge evolutionary history and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.420" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">political history and so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.520" end="00:16:34.110" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of for me the point on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:36.870" style="s2">other side of these culture wars in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.110" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">sense what do you think the center looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.870" end="00:16:40.110" style="s2">like from that kind of meta perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:42.090" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting because no matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.110" end="00:16:44.430" style="s2">how frustrated I am with the left now I</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.090" end="00:16:46.260" style="s2">don&#39;t argue that somehow the left has</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.430" end="00:16:48.780" style="s2">never been good or that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.260" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">ideas that have come out of the left</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.780" end="00:16:54.360" style="s2">have not been good so you know equality</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:57.630" style="s2">for women voting rights for women good</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.360" end="00:16:58.940" style="s2">the Civil Rights Act good gay marriage</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.630" end="00:17:01.770" style="s2">these are things that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.940" end="00:17:03.330" style="s2">progressive ideas now all of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.770" end="00:17:06.060" style="s2">things what did all of those things have</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.330" end="00:17:08.579" style="s2">in common they all helped make people</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.060" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">equal equal in that they had equal</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.579" end="00:17:12.180" style="s2">opportunity and they were equal under</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:14.069" style="s2">the law that&#39;s all the Western society</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.180" end="00:17:17.189" style="s2">can guarantee you I would say that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.069" end="00:17:19.709" style="s2">any functioning free society can offer</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.189" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">you is absolute equal playing field it</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.709" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re born into the exact</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:24.449" style="s2">same circumstance so some of us are born</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">into a rich family some of us are born</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.449" end="00:17:29.100" style="s2">poor some of us are born handicapped</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:31.290" style="s2">some of us are born with great athletic</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.100" end="00:17:33.330" style="s2">skill I mean all of those things are not</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.290" end="00:17:37.140" style="s2">privileges per se those are just the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.330" end="00:17:39.870" style="s2">nature&#39;s of reality so I acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.140" end="00:17:40.140" style="s2">that there there was a decent left and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:42.990" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.140" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">too long ago that that left existed now</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.990" end="00:17:46.380" style="s2">what I would say on the right is right</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:47.820" style="s2">now as I just said because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.380" end="00:17:50.070" style="s2">interesting you know you&#39;ve got Trump</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.820" end="00:17:51.809" style="s2">people and neo cons and never Trump errs</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.070" end="00:17:55.049" style="s2">and libertarians and classical you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.809" end="00:17:57.210" style="s2">this really wide group of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.049" end="00:18:00.179" style="s2">all sort of agreeing to disagree right</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.210" end="00:18:01.260" style="s2">now and I go to colleges and I get up</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.179" end="00:18:02.820" style="s2">and I let me get invited by</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.260" end="00:18:04.920" style="s2">conservatives and libertarians I never</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.820" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">get invited by Democrats or lefties or</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.920" end="00:18:09.090" style="s2">liberals or anything like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.040" style="s2">give a different speech every time but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.090" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">would gladly go and talk to those people</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.040" end="00:18:13.740" style="s2">I just don&#39;t get invited to them now</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:15.270" style="s2">you&#39;d think well how does that make</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.740" end="00:18:18.150" style="s2">sense you&#39;re gay married you&#39;re pro pot</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.940" end="00:18:25.290" style="s2">education I mean these are all left you</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.590" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">know thought of as lefty ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.290" end="00:18:30.510" style="s2">because I talk about identity politics I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:34.470" style="s2">focus on free speech I&#39;m frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.510" end="00:18:37.230" style="s2">the core of what leftism has become um</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.470" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">I&#39;m an apostate to those guys so I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.230" end="00:18:42.450" style="s2">say the center the center now has</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">shifted a little bit right and if you if</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.450" end="00:18:47.070" style="s2">you have a basic understanding that what</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:48.870" style="s2">you&#39;re guaranteed let&#39;s say in the</p>

<p begin="00:18:50.510" end="00:18:55.559" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna have to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.340" end="00:18:57.330" style="s2">society with people that you disagree</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.559" end="00:18:59.790" style="s2">with I have no idea what my neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.330" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">thinks politically I I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.790" end="00:19:02.250" style="s2">on either side of my house I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:04.650" style="s2">these people that often they seem like</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.250" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">decent people but I suspect we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.650" end="00:19:08.520" style="s2">on a whole slew of things well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:10.830" style="s2">welcome to do that they can&#39;t do it on</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.520" end="00:19:12.540" style="s2">my property but beyond that they can do</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.830" end="00:19:14.970" style="s2">that and I would much rather live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.540" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">that society than a society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.970" end="00:19:19.559" style="s2">forcing us all to think all the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:21.540" style="s2">things so yes we need you know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.559" end="00:19:23.910" style="s2">talks about sort of a healthy tension</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.540" end="00:19:25.710" style="s2">between the right and the left we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.910" end="00:19:28.200" style="s2">need some of that but I would say right</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.710" end="00:19:29.970" style="s2">now because what is happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.200" end="00:19:32.820" style="s2">left has become so toxic that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.970" end="00:19:35.610" style="s2">freethought is really being crushed and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.820" end="00:19:37.110" style="s2">destroyed and if you dare go against any</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.610" end="00:19:40.200" style="s2">of those things look I just gave you my</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.110" end="00:19:42.270" style="s2">lefty cred wood is there anyone on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.200" end="00:19:44.040" style="s2">left that will tolerate me no I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.270" end="00:19:46.049" style="s2">just isn&#39;t now there may be an</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.040" end="00:19:47.820" style="s2">individual person Brett Weinstein still</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.049" end="00:19:49.530" style="s2">thinks of himself on the left he&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.820" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">to me but I mean in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.530" end="00:19:53.859" style="s2">institutional version of the left there</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.779" style="s2">there is nobody so</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.859" end="00:19:58.639" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy to keep talking to these</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.779" end="00:19:59.599" style="s2">conservatives that maybe five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.639" end="00:20:01.580" style="s2">I thought were the bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.599" end="00:20:04.789" style="s2">or these people on the right because</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.580" end="00:20:06.649" style="s2">they seem very open and let&#39;s keep let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.789" end="00:20:08.389" style="s2">keep enriching that and see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.649" end="00:20:10.009" style="s2">and if the center and sup becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.389" end="00:20:11.659" style="s2">little more right then maybe I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.009" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">ten years ago all right you know you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.659" end="00:20:15.349" style="s2">don&#39;t get everything exactly as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:17.179" style="s2">wanted but I think that would be the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.349" end="00:20:19.879" style="s2">space for the most freedom to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.179" end="00:20:22.999" style="s2">flourish and the the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.879" end="00:20:25.099" style="s2">darkweb as first conceived was a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.999" end="00:20:26.919" style="s2">alternative sense making framework it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.099" end="00:20:29.509" style="s2">kind of the naming of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.919" end="00:20:32.389" style="s2">alternative media and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.509" end="00:20:36.019" style="s2">especially with maybe the Covington</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.389" end="00:20:37.129" style="s2">thing this this year that the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.019" end="00:20:38.629" style="s2">mainstream and probably the Muller</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.129" end="00:20:40.789" style="s2">report as well the mainstream media is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.629" end="00:20:43.549" style="s2">kind of hemorrhaging credibility at a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.789" end="00:20:46.099" style="s2">faster and faster rate and in a way the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.549" end="00:20:48.200" style="s2">naming of the IDW was kind of the coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.099" end="00:20:50.809" style="s2">to fruition of a of a new alternative</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.200" end="00:20:52.729" style="s2">media and what it feels to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.809" end="00:20:55.669" style="s2">happened since I&#39;m thinking specifically</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.729" end="00:20:58.549" style="s2">of for example Joe Rogan&#39;s into Jack</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.669" end="00:21:00.619" style="s2">Dorsey he got more pushback than I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.549" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">seen him ever get from his audience for</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.619" end="00:21:05.659" style="s2">not holding Jack to account and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:07.609" style="s2">really interesting it feels like over</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.659" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">the last year some of the expectations</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.609" end="00:21:12.169" style="s2">of the mainstream media and now being</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:15.109" style="s2">applied to the alternative media like</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.169" end="00:21:17.089" style="s2">that that now but it&#39;s kind of flipped</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.109" end="00:21:18.679" style="s2">in a way but with that flipping comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.089" end="00:21:21.139" style="s2">some kind of new responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.679" end="00:21:22.129" style="s2">absolutely so that makes sense it not</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.139" end="00:21:23.809" style="s2">only does that make sense I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.129" end="00:21:25.759" style="s2">that actually is the reality of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.809" end="00:21:27.619" style="s2">going on here look first off when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.759" end="00:21:30.830" style="s2">talk about the mainstream media we all</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.619" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">use phrases - that are sort of blanket</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.830" end="00:21:35.269" style="s2">phrases to talk about small things so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:38.809" style="s2">don&#39;t say everyone in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.269" end="00:21:40.940" style="s2">media is horrible but by and large most</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.809" end="00:21:44.690" style="s2">of what the mainstream media offers us</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.940" end="00:21:46.570" style="s2">is some version of propaganda and we see</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.690" end="00:21:48.950" style="s2">this over and over again and we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.570" end="00:21:52.129" style="s2">you know between the Covington&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.950" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">between the Jesse smollett story between</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.129" end="00:21:56.389" style="s2">the Miller report between all of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:21:59.450" style="s2">things you start realizing why are</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.389" end="00:22:02.749" style="s2">things always framed through this sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.450" end="00:22:04.309" style="s2">of leftist social justice prism or that</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.309" end="00:22:08.779" style="s2">default the bad guy or that Trump</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.779" end="00:22:11.749" style="s2">Trump Russia thing is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.489" end="00:22:13.460" style="s2">interesting ones because I&#39;ve had plenty</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.749" end="00:22:15.080" style="s2">of people on this show that were that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.460" end="00:22:17.720" style="s2">have been vehemently against Trump from</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.080" end="00:22:19.460" style="s2">the beginning say say Sam Harris who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.720" end="00:22:22.580" style="s2">been one of his biggest critics I&#39;ve had</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.230" end="00:22:26.779" style="s2">him on others say ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.340" end="00:22:29.539" style="s2">and i&#39;ve had people who were supporters</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.779" end="00:22:31.639" style="s2">of his like scott adams and that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.539" end="00:22:33.379" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that surprised when the election</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.639" end="00:22:35.239" style="s2">happened because i had been listening to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.379" end="00:22:36.830" style="s2">people from all over the place i had</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.239" end="00:22:38.090" style="s2">mike cern Abidjan and i got a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.830" end="00:22:40.220" style="s2">crap for it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.090" end="00:22:43.149" style="s2">but i thought where is a trump supporter</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.220" end="00:22:45.769" style="s2">that maybe can explain a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.149" end="00:22:47.690" style="s2">the gestalt of what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.769" end="00:22:50.869" style="s2">Serna vich was a published author and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.690" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">this was before he became sort of no no</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.869" end="00:22:55.609" style="s2">he&#39;s quite a household name but an</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">Internet household name let&#39;s say and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.609" end="00:22:59.090" style="s2">thought let me let me talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:01.340" style="s2">who kind of gets it so when the election</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.090" end="00:23:02.809" style="s2">day rolled around and I was on Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.340" end="00:23:04.789" style="s2">I think that I was either on the day</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.809" end="00:23:07.009" style="s2">before the election or maybe the day of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.789" end="00:23:08.840" style="s2">the election I kept saying I it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.009" end="00:23:10.309" style="s2">possible Trump could win because I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.840" end="00:23:11.210" style="s2">been hearing those conversations but if</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.309" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">you had only been listening to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.210" end="00:23:14.989" style="s2">mainstream media you wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:16.460" style="s2">gotten any of that so I would say look</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.989" end="00:23:18.289" style="s2">I&#39;m not happy that we&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.460" end="00:23:19.759" style="s2">mainstream media fail if mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.289" end="00:23:21.409" style="s2">media would just be I tweet this all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.759" end="00:23:23.929" style="s2">time if mainstream media would just be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.409" end="00:23:26.629" style="s2">little bit better then there would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.929" end="00:23:28.279" style="s2">less need for all of what we&#39;re doing if</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.629" end="00:23:29.869" style="s2">they would be willing to have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.279" end="00:23:32.090" style="s2">honest conversations if they would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.869" end="00:23:33.889" style="s2">willing to talk about policy without</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.090" end="00:23:35.269" style="s2">labeling half the country deplorable or</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.889" end="00:23:37.009" style="s2">racist and what about the extra</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.269" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">responsibility that places on to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.009" end="00:23:40.489" style="s2">alternative well so then what that does</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:42.220" style="s2">is well okay so now so we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.489" end="00:23:44.629" style="s2">mainstream media kind of crumbling and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.220" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">then suddenly there were these voices on</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.629" end="00:23:48.919" style="s2">YouTube mostly on YouTube but now</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.159" end="00:23:50.690" style="s2">through podcasts who started having real</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.919" end="00:23:53.419" style="s2">conversations so for example the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.690" end="00:23:56.600" style="s2">version of the Rubin report where we did</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.419" end="00:23:57.799" style="s2">a where did a straight-up interview it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.600" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">only about three and a half years ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.799" end="00:24:02.090" style="s2">now it was September of 2015</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:04.009" style="s2">and I had Sam Harris on and we were</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.090" end="00:24:05.929" style="s2">there to clean up some of the mess</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.009" end="00:24:07.820" style="s2">around all of the things people had been</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.929" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">saying about him and it all started with</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.820" end="00:24:12.470" style="s2">that Ben Affleck gross and racist line</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:13.730" style="s2">and we finished the show and I we sat</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.470" end="00:24:15.710" style="s2">there for about an hour and a half I</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.730" end="00:24:18.619" style="s2">thought wow we just did something</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.710" end="00:24:20.220" style="s2">important it felt important and real and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.619" end="00:24:22.020" style="s2">honest and relevant</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.220" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">to me where I never saw any of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.020" end="00:24:25.860" style="s2">anymore you could even look look at CNN</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:27.510" style="s2">you know when they got rid of Larry King</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.860" end="00:24:29.159" style="s2">I really think you know Larry&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.510" end="00:24:30.570" style="s2">friend and a mentor in the fact that he</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.159" end="00:24:32.700" style="s2">thinks I&#39;m even remotely decent at this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.570" end="00:24:34.530" style="s2">is incredible but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.700" end="00:24:35.940" style="s2">coincidence that when CNN got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.530" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">Larry King whose show by the way was</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.940" end="00:24:38.850" style="s2">either number one or number two show on</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:39.870" style="s2">the network but they wanted to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.850" end="00:24:42.690" style="s2">younger I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.870" end="00:24:44.580" style="s2">that CNN started to crumble because</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.690" end="00:24:47.669" style="s2">whatever you thought of Larry and I I</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.580" end="00:24:49.409" style="s2">loved him and loved him now he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.669" end="00:24:50.789" style="s2">having real conversations now you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.409" end="00:24:52.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t like the way he interviewed or</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.789" end="00:24:55.080" style="s2">this or that but he was he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.620" end="00:24:56.760" style="s2">a trusted decent human being who was</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.080" end="00:24:58.169" style="s2">having real conversations and once he</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.760" end="00:25:01.590" style="s2">disappeared they replaced him with Piers</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.169" end="00:25:03.720" style="s2">Morgan then that failed then the last</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.590" end="00:25:06.270" style="s2">little bits of remnants of trust in</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.720" end="00:25:08.429" style="s2">cable news basically just eroded and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.270" end="00:25:10.110" style="s2">then that that spread then into into</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.429" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">Network News and then I think it spread</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.110" end="00:25:16.740" style="s2">into the the BuzzFeed HuffPo Vox monster</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">whatever you want to call that so yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.740" end="00:25:20.700" style="s2">there is an odd amount of pressure on us</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:23.159" style="s2">now which which is weird because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.700" end="00:25:25.620" style="s2">a journalist I&#39;m again I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.159" end="00:25:27.330" style="s2">interviewer I do the best I can I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.620" end="00:25:28.830" style="s2">lie to my audience I will flub things</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.330" end="00:25:32.340" style="s2">now and again I try to correct myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.830" end="00:25:34.650" style="s2">when we do but I don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.340" end="00:25:36.450" style="s2">standards we should be held to so Joe in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.650" end="00:25:38.370" style="s2">the case that you&#39;re talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.450" end="00:25:40.289" style="s2">he had Jack on originally I think he did</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.370" end="00:25:41.730" style="s2">look he must have acknowledged at some</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.289" end="00:25:43.470" style="s2">level that he didn&#39;t get it all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.730" end="00:25:45.210" style="s2">because he saw the push back and then he</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.470" end="00:25:46.830" style="s2">had Tim Poole on to sort of act as the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.210" end="00:25:49.409" style="s2">interlock er between them and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.830" end="00:25:53.250" style="s2">that was the right move but should Joe</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.409" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">be held to the standards of if he was on</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.250" end="00:25:58.200" style="s2">CNN and doing that show I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">exactly but he is by his audience I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.200" end="00:26:01.590" style="s2">that&#39;s the key right so if you&#39;re held</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">by your audience so that&#39;s good if</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.590" end="00:26:04.830" style="s2">you&#39;re how about your audience as</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:06.210" style="s2">opposed to the mob I guess that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.830" end="00:26:08.610" style="s2">distinction that we have to make that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.210" end="00:26:10.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a never moving amorphous mob</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.610" end="00:26:12.570" style="s2">coming for everybody all the time the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.710" end="00:26:13.799" style="s2">second you say something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.570" end="00:26:15.480" style="s2">sound right to them or if they can</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.799" end="00:26:16.860" style="s2">selectively edit something you say to</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.480" end="00:26:18.780" style="s2">make it sound like something you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.860" end="00:26:20.520" style="s2">say or anything else then the mob will</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.780" end="00:26:24.360" style="s2">come for you being held to account by</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.520" end="00:26:26.490" style="s2">your audience is good so if I brought</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.360" end="00:26:30.450" style="s2">someone in here and really dropped the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.490" end="00:26:31.890" style="s2">ball relative to some some question that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.450" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">I should have got to or some follow-up I</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.890" end="00:26:35.010" style="s2">should have had sometimes people will</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:35.940" style="s2">tweet at me or Willie million so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.010" end="00:26:38.850" style="s2">know I wish you would have asked this</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.940" end="00:26:40.770" style="s2">person out of it and I&#39;ll go alright you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.850" end="00:26:42.929" style="s2">know like I&#39;m learning on the job too</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.770" end="00:26:44.700" style="s2">and I hope to keep getting better at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.929" end="00:26:46.110" style="s2">that so I like being held to a high</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.700" end="00:26:49.350" style="s2">standard I don&#39;t know that we can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.110" end="00:26:51.390" style="s2">held because we&#39;re not a unified front I</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.350" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">mean Joe and I happen to both do things</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.390" end="00:26:54.840" style="s2">on YouTube and we&#39;re podcasters and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:56.610" style="s2">we&#39;re interviewers and we both happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.840" end="00:26:59.159" style="s2">to do stand-up but we&#39;re not we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.610" end="00:27:02.220" style="s2">work together you know so there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.159" end="00:27:03.570" style="s2">sort of a layer of a network effect that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.220" end="00:27:05.940" style="s2">would keep us in line with each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.570" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">but what I can say is generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:09.330" style="s2">the the crew that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:11.130" style="s2">here these people have very high</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.330" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">standards they have high integrity we</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.130" end="00:27:16.440" style="s2">don&#39;t impugn motives we don&#39;t attack</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:18.840" style="s2">people we try to talk about ideas more</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.440" end="00:27:20.220" style="s2">than people and hopefully if we&#39;re held</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.840" end="00:27:22.440" style="s2">to some higher standards even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.220" end="00:27:24.710" style="s2">not quite fair hopefully we can live up</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.440" end="00:27:28.529" style="s2">to them so do you think that your job</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.710" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">might be changing as the as the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.529" end="00:27:32.370" style="s2">culture changes</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:35.370" style="s2">well it&#39;s changing in that all of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.370" end="00:27:37.320" style="s2">profiles are higher now you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.370" end="00:27:39.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think anything I&#39;m doing per se</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.320" end="00:27:40.289" style="s2">you know I&#39;m working on my book I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.000" end="00:27:42.059" style="s2">doing the interviews I do public</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.289" end="00:27:43.289" style="s2">speaking all of these things those</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.059" end="00:27:44.940" style="s2">things are consistent I mean hopefully I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.289" end="00:27:46.620" style="s2">get more of those gigs and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.940" end="00:27:50.730" style="s2">audience continues to grow in all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.620" end="00:27:53.640" style="s2">those things but I guess by the nature</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.730" end="00:27:55.409" style="s2">of things growing and more people caring</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.640" end="00:27:57.450" style="s2">about the ideas of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.409" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">web and if not if the IDW has done</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:01.620" style="s2">anything I would say we created a space</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.490" end="00:28:03.690" style="s2">where people could just think a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.620" end="00:28:05.640" style="s2">bit and you know most people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.690" end="00:28:07.590" style="s2">watching these videos on your phone so</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.640" end="00:28:09.299" style="s2">it&#39;s a salt it&#39;s a solitary experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.590" end="00:28:12.149" style="s2">where you&#39;re listening you know in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.299" end="00:28:14.250" style="s2">earbuds or whatever and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.149" end="00:28:16.740" style="s2">if well if you&#39;re at the gym and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.250" end="00:28:18.740" style="s2">listening to me talk to Peterson it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.740" end="00:28:20.760" style="s2">like is anyone else at this gym</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.740" end="00:28:22.260" style="s2">listening to Peterson does anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.760" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">know about any of this stuff and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.260" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">what&#39;s so cool about going to the live</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:27.570" style="s2">events because then you look around the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:29.610" style="s2">room and you go whoa there&#39;s thousands</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.570" end="00:28:31.080" style="s2">of people here and they come from every</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.610" end="00:28:32.940" style="s2">walk of life and what do they want to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.080" end="00:28:34.440" style="s2">they want to have honest conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.940" end="00:28:35.970" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to rip apart all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.440" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">goodness that the West has offered us</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.970" end="00:28:41.820" style="s2">they want to agree to disagree and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:43.049" style="s2">they they look diverse actually even</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.820" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">though that&#39;s not the diversity that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.049" end="00:28:47.490" style="s2">matters and that&#39;s that&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:49.350" style="s2">cool so we have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.490" end="00:28:51.090" style="s2">we have to keep opening that space that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.350" end="00:28:53.309" style="s2">which I think you&#39;re referring to is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.090" end="00:28:54.510" style="s2">middle it&#39;s that space to be a thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.309" end="00:28:56.580" style="s2">human being that we have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.510" end="00:28:57.779" style="s2">defending no matter how hard it gets and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.580" end="00:28:59.970" style="s2">actually the harder it gets to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.779" end="00:29:02.370" style="s2">the more important it is so I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.970" end="00:29:05.929" style="s2">our work is cut out for us because I</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.370" end="00:29:09.270" style="s2">guess my my concern or my question is</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.929" end="00:29:12.059" style="s2">whether the the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.270" end="00:29:14.429" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s often characterized as</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.059" end="00:29:16.649" style="s2">being merely reactionary that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.429" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s and in some sense it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.649" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">because it is reacting against the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:23.100" style="s2">way that some conversations have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:24.899" style="s2">shut down so there is a reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.100" end="00:29:26.580" style="s2">element to it in terms of we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.899" end="00:29:28.679" style="s2">carve out a space for genuine dialogue I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.580" end="00:29:31.169" style="s2">guess my concern looking from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.679" end="00:29:33.480" style="s2">outside is whether it&#39;s genuine and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.169" end="00:29:36.059" style="s2">pushing forward to a new synthesis or</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.480" end="00:29:37.049" style="s2">potential synthesis or it&#39;s just stuck</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.059" end="00:29:39.000" style="s2">in because you&#39;ll always have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.049" end="00:29:42.120" style="s2">audience for saying the left is going</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.000" end="00:29:43.649" style="s2">out of control yeah but it is it pushing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.120" end="00:29:44.970" style="s2">forward to a new synthesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.649" end="00:29:47.309" style="s2">something you&#39;re interested in doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.970" end="00:29:49.740" style="s2">yeah well I don&#39;t always want to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.309" end="00:29:51.149" style="s2">reacting as a human being I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.740" end="00:29:54.330" style="s2">that and I don&#39;t want my conversations</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.149" end="00:29:55.980" style="s2">in here to be oh what happened this week</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.330" end="00:29:57.779" style="s2">let&#39;s react to it I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.980" end="00:30:00.059" style="s2">how you can actually forge a better</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.779" end="00:30:02.760" style="s2">freer society we have to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.059" end="00:30:04.740" style="s2">good ideas get those ideas out there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.760" end="00:30:06.390" style="s2">then hopefully the good ones will stick</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.740" end="00:30:09.620" style="s2">and they will be the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.390" end="00:30:19.020" style="s2">societies are built on and care about so</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.620" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">I would say mainly if we can open up a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.020" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">little bit of a space to have those</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">conversations if we can keep that space</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">open right so we have this we have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:27.210" style="s2">opening right now and we know that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">can&#39;t that it&#39;s being attacked on both</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.210" end="00:30:30.600" style="s2">sides let&#39;s say and generally more from</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:32.250" style="s2">the left but it&#39;s being attacked but if</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.600" end="00:30:34.230" style="s2">we can keep that space open well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.250" end="00:30:36.330" style="s2">all sorts of rich conversations to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.230" end="00:30:37.890" style="s2">that are not reactionary in nature so</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.330" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">when Jordan is talking about personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.890" end="00:30:42.600" style="s2">responsibility which you know this is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.250" style="s2">idea as old as anything out there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.600" end="00:30:46.260" style="s2">not a reactionary position for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.250" end="00:30:48.899" style="s2">reason right now and perhaps more with</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.260" end="00:30:51.029" style="s2">young men there is a real need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.899" end="00:30:53.070" style="s2">understand what personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.029" end="00:30:54.990" style="s2">is there is a real need to clean your</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.070" end="00:30:56.039" style="s2">room get your life in order before you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.990" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">get the world in order and that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.039" end="00:30:59.350" style="s2">reactionary position yet it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:01.390" style="s2">incredibly important position to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.350" end="00:31:02.530" style="s2">right now we have constant conversations</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.390" end="00:31:04.539" style="s2">right now is there a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.530" end="00:31:07.030" style="s2">gender and sex or do these words even</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.539" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">mean anything anymore well we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.030" end="00:31:10.600" style="s2">to evolutionary biologists like Brett</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.850" style="s2">Weinstein about that now that is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.600" end="00:31:17.049" style="s2">reacting to a conversation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.850" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">happening culturally but yes we have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.049" end="00:31:22.120" style="s2">figure out beyond just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:25.450" style="s2">these things is this a political</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.120" end="00:31:27.910" style="s2">movement is this is it a political party</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.450" end="00:31:30.190" style="s2">is this a road show is this a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.910" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">network or a TV network or a cable news</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.190" end="00:31:34.120" style="s2">network or is it nothing are we of just</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.740" style="s2">a bunch of bounty hunters that are all</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.120" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean bounty hunters and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.740" end="00:31:39.549" style="s2">we&#39;re all searching for bounty I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:42.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re just a loosely affiliated</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.549" end="00:31:44.590" style="s2">group of people doing our own thing who</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.940" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">occasionally come together and people</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.590" end="00:31:49.990" style="s2">like seeing us together I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">that is what it is actually we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.990" end="00:31:53.140" style="s2">to agree and disagree on things you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">I think there&#39;s also advantages to not</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.140" end="00:31:57.610" style="s2">being that tightly associated with each</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:31:59.740" style="s2">other in case one person gets taken down</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.610" end="00:32:01.480" style="s2">yet at the same time there&#39;s strength in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.740" end="00:32:06.100" style="s2">numbers so you know there are advantages</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.480" end="00:32:08.289" style="s2">to being grouped together as well but</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.100" end="00:32:10.929" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see but I would say the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.289" end="00:32:12.610" style="s2">is good at this it&#39;s good I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.929" end="00:32:13.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve all sat there and been like all</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.610" end="00:32:15.700" style="s2">right well this is what this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.750" end="00:32:17.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it&#39;s gonna be and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.700" end="00:32:20.049" style="s2">gonna go get it it&#39;s more that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.320" end="00:32:23.409" style="s2">evolving as we&#39;re evolving with time and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.049" end="00:32:26.140" style="s2">also we live in an extremely tumultuous</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.409" end="00:32:29.049" style="s2">time right now especially our political</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.140" end="00:32:30.850" style="s2">system our our media system all of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.049" end="00:32:33.250" style="s2">things seem to be shaking right now and</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.850" end="00:32:36.070" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to navigate through and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.250" end="00:32:37.900" style="s2">again hold that hold that little space</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.070" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">where people can stay in there and come</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.900" end="00:32:41.530" style="s2">along with us and then I think whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:43.750" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be you know maybe Ben&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.530" end="00:32:45.549" style="s2">supposed to run for office and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.750" end="00:32:48.549" style="s2">Brett&#39;s supposed to start a university</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.549" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">and you know Joe is supposed to get a TV</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.549" end="00:32:52.809" style="s2">show and you know we&#39;ll all go on our</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:54.370" style="s2">merry way but hopefully if we can hold</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.809" end="00:32:57.700" style="s2">this thing Society won&#39;t spin off into</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.370" end="00:32:58.990" style="s2">the oblivion because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.700" end="00:33:01.210" style="s2">sense with a lot of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.990" end="00:33:02.500" style="s2">IDW and I&#39;d say Jordan does this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.210" end="00:33:03.669" style="s2">as well as anyone like there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.559" end="00:33:10.780" style="s2">your recent Rubin report shows I think I</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.870" end="00:33:12.560" style="s2">think it was Warren with Eric Jordan and</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.560" end="00:33:18.200" style="s2">you had a you all reflected on what you</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.200" end="00:33:21.890" style="s2">valid and I think you said something</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:24.230" style="s2">about political PTSD which is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.890" end="00:33:26.330" style="s2">that breath and Erica talked about can</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.230" end="00:33:27.830" style="s2">you explain yeah well so the so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.330" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">reason I asked the question at the end</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.830" end="00:33:32.840" style="s2">of that interview with with it was Eric</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.790" style="s2">Jordan and Ben was you know we have done</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.840" end="00:33:36.200" style="s2">some pretty heavy idea lifting during</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.790" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">the hour hour and a half of that and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.200" end="00:33:40.490" style="s2">thought well what what could I ask them</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:42.410" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:44.120" style="s2">different a little more personal because</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.410" end="00:33:45.800" style="s2">people do want to know who we are and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.120" end="00:33:47.270" style="s2">can truly tell you that this this whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.800" end="00:33:49.070" style="s2">crew what you&#39;re seeing on camera with</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.270" end="00:33:50.150" style="s2">these guys these guys aren&#39;t actors I</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.070" end="00:33:52.130" style="s2">mean there are some people you sit down</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.150" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">with and you know privately they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.130" end="00:33:54.830" style="s2">shy or very quiet whatever then the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">camera goes on and they just light up</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.830" end="00:33:57.410" style="s2">these guys it&#39;s the same thing we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:00.110" style="s2">to dinner it&#39;s the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.410" end="00:34:01.730" style="s2">conversations exact same interactions</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.110" end="00:34:03.470" style="s2">with each other all sorts of stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.730" end="00:34:07.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about it about myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.470" end="00:34:09.700" style="s2">that have I missed something do I have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.070" end="00:34:12.050" style="s2">blind spot here am i overestimating what</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.700" end="00:34:14.179" style="s2">post-modernism is doing for the left is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.050" end="00:34:15.800" style="s2">there more of a threat on the right than</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.179" end="00:34:17.360" style="s2">I&#39;m acknowledging I really was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.800" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">that for myself and I thought well who</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.360" end="00:34:20.990" style="s2">better to talk about that with and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:23.870" style="s2">question that with them than this crew</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.990" end="00:34:26.390" style="s2">so for myself I talk that maybe I have</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.870" end="00:34:28.550" style="s2">some level of political PTSD because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.390" end="00:34:30.620" style="s2">was part of the left I now see how they</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.550" end="00:34:34.790" style="s2">treat me and anyone who holds virtually</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.620" end="00:34:36.590" style="s2">or somewhat similar ideas as me I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.790" end="00:34:38.630" style="s2">say interestingly Brett who you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.590" end="00:34:40.460" style="s2">referenced there who was the first one</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.630" end="00:34:41.870" style="s2">to say to me you know Dave you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.460" end="00:34:44.510" style="s2">maybe you have some version of political</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.870" end="00:34:46.190" style="s2">PTSD I suspect if we were to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.510" end="00:34:49.070" style="s2">with Brett right now he would probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.190" end="00:34:51.740" style="s2">be a lot closer to where I am than where</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.070" end="00:34:53.720" style="s2">he was then because he&#39;s now only being</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.740" end="00:34:55.460" style="s2">treated horribly by the left as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.720" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">of fact I when I do stand-up now I</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.460" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">usually I do about an hour stand-up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:00.500" style="s2">then I bring one of the IDW crew and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve brought your Deborah Cristina I</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.500" end="00:35:04.340" style="s2">brought both of the Weinsteins a couple</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.270" end="00:35:06.260" style="s2">other people and most of my audience now</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.340" end="00:35:07.670" style="s2">leans conservative I usually do a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.260" end="00:35:09.620" style="s2">fun poll I try to figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.670" end="00:35:11.060" style="s2">everyone&#39;s at and now you get Brett</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.620" end="00:35:13.220" style="s2">going up there and he talks about being</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.060" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">a progressive and guess what they</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.220" end="00:35:17.240" style="s2">applaud him and they like him now he</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:20.600" style="s2">knows he can&#39;t go anywhere and get</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.240" end="00:35:22.580" style="s2">applauded by progressives so maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.600" end="00:35:25.980" style="s2">have a little political PTSD but I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.580" end="00:35:27.930" style="s2">say it&#39;s also a bit of just reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.980" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">so I like asking questions like that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.930" end="00:35:33.300" style="s2">know Ben Jordan do you have a blind spot</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">you know and and and are you aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.300" end="00:35:36.420" style="s2">and if it&#39;s that blind I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know about it but that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.420" end="00:35:40.860" style="s2">also shows a little bit of a human part</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.100" end="00:35:42.660" style="s2">of this because we&#39;re people too I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.860" end="00:35:45.060" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re criticized more than</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.660" end="00:35:48.270" style="s2">anyone else because of your biography</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.060" end="00:35:50.610" style="s2">that saying I&#39;m a liberal who&#39;s seen</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.270" end="00:35:52.860" style="s2">that the left has gone too far and some</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.610" end="00:35:55.620" style="s2">of the some of the criticisms are saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.860" end="00:35:58.410" style="s2">that that&#39;s some kind of an act I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.620" end="00:36:02.310" style="s2">or always so some like my question I</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.410" end="00:36:05.010" style="s2">guess is first can you see that that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.310" end="00:36:07.800" style="s2">quite a powerful story like in a way the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.010" end="00:36:09.090" style="s2">the concerns or the cynicism towards it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:12.270" style="s2">is partly because that&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.090" end="00:36:14.310" style="s2">story in itself well I suppose it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.270" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">powerful story because any story about</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.310" end="00:36:18.390" style="s2">evolution your personal evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">what a story is I mean every movie is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.390" end="00:36:21.900" style="s2">about a character evolving you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.280" end="00:36:24.750" style="s2">start somewhere and you end up somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.900" end="00:36:28.170" style="s2">else so I suppose that&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.750" end="00:36:29.730" style="s2">human story but if the implication</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.170" end="00:36:31.980" style="s2">somehow is that I&#39;ve done that I that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.730" end="00:36:33.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve somehow planned this or something</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.980" end="00:36:35.640" style="s2">like that it actually couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.750" end="00:36:37.950" style="s2">further from the truth I mean the true</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.640" end="00:36:39.210" style="s2">truth is and you can watch I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.950" end="00:36:40.440" style="s2">would say anyone that that really</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.210" end="00:36:43.230" style="s2">believes this if you want to spend the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.440" end="00:36:45.060" style="s2">time you can watch my direct messages in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.230" end="00:36:47.850" style="s2">my interviews when I started waking up</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.060" end="00:36:51.120" style="s2">to this stuff watch my shows in fall of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.850" end="00:36:54.150" style="s2">2015 before Trump was elected and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.120" end="00:36:56.370" style="s2">can hear me saying I&#39;m a lefty guys</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.150" end="00:36:58.140" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here we&#39;ve got to stop</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.370" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">labeling everybody we can&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.140" end="00:37:02.250" style="s2">everyone a Nazi because then when the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:03.660" style="s2">real Nazis come you won&#39;t even know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.250" end="00:37:05.550" style="s2">we&#39;re painting ourselves into an</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.660" end="00:37:07.170" style="s2">intellectual corner we&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.550" end="00:37:09.360" style="s2">better at this as a matter of fact when</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.170" end="00:37:12.300" style="s2">I did the Prager you video which was</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.360" end="00:37:14.040" style="s2">titled why I left the left I never said</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.300" end="00:37:15.810" style="s2">the phrase that I left the left that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.040" end="00:37:17.970" style="s2">never uttered by me either in this room</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.810" end="00:37:19.500" style="s2">nor in that video and when the video</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.970" end="00:37:21.540" style="s2">went up that morning I was laying in bed</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.500" end="00:37:23.220" style="s2">and I got a notification and I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.540" end="00:37:26.850" style="s2">pissed because I was like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.220" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">I&#39;m still on the left and it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.850" end="00:37:30.810" style="s2">that the left has counter voices because</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:33.240" style="s2">the whole problem here is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.810" end="00:37:34.680" style="s2">become a movement of groupthink now I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.240" end="00:37:36.330" style="s2">quickly realized within an hour that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.680" end="00:37:39.060" style="s2">video was going so viral that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.330" end="00:37:40.410" style="s2">is gonna be okay but can I honestly say</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.060" end="00:37:42.780" style="s2">I&#39;m part of the left anymore of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.410" end="00:37:44.910" style="s2">not now if some of these guys if if Sam</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.780" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">and Brett and and Eric perhaps or</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.910" end="00:37:48.750" style="s2">whoever else want to say they are I</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:51.360" style="s2">don&#39;t but I don&#39;t begrudge them that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.750" end="00:37:54.210" style="s2">they should identify however they think</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.360" end="00:37:56.940" style="s2">they should but for me personally I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.210" end="00:37:59.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know that anyone in this space has</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.940" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">been more open about their evolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.550" end="00:38:02.730" style="s2">then I have I think that&#39;s partly why</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:05.340" style="s2">people care about what I do because</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.730" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve watched me they&#39;ve watched me</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.340" end="00:38:08.610" style="s2">learn they watch me change they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:09.720" style="s2">watched me actually Institute you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.610" end="00:38:11.340" style="s2">everyone talks about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.720" end="00:38:12.780" style="s2">everyone talks about tolerance and all</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.340" end="00:38:15.660" style="s2">of these things but I think people have</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.780" end="00:38:18.870" style="s2">actually seen me not only experience it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.660" end="00:38:20.340" style="s2">but express it and that&#39;s scary to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.870" end="00:38:21.960" style="s2">of people so the people that criticized</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.340" end="00:38:23.250" style="s2">me well first off you&#39;re welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.960" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">criticize me no one&#39;s above criticism</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.250" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but the truth is they just</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:31.080" style="s2">don&#39;t really want me talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:34.680" style="s2">ideas they don&#39;t want their Achilles</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.080" end="00:38:36.600" style="s2">heel to be exposed and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.680" end="00:38:39.150" style="s2">problem I mean there are a million shows</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.600" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">on cable news and everywhere else where</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.150" end="00:38:44.190" style="s2">you can watch lefties and progressives</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:45.810" style="s2">talk about all sorts of things I created</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.190" end="00:38:47.850" style="s2">a little bit of space here where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.810" end="00:38:49.530" style="s2">criticize where often we criticize the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.850" end="00:38:51.030" style="s2">left although that&#39;s not really the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.530" end="00:38:53.370" style="s2">purpose of the show it&#39;s I&#39;ll talk to</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.190" end="00:39:32.940" style="s2">against those things now you&#39;re really a</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.050" end="00:39:40.260" style="s2">the criticism because I think if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:42.060" end="00:39:45.540" style="s2">find some of the criticism boring it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.740" end="00:39:47.310" style="s2">just these trolls you know all day long</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.540" end="00:39:50.130" style="s2">but but but I would say more than</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.310" end="00:39:51.329" style="s2">anything else legit criticism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.130" end="00:39:53.670" style="s2">worried than happy to discuss and I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.670" end="00:39:58.349" style="s2">mean Jordan Peterson has said before</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.349" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">just sort of play devil&#39;s advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.910" end="00:40:03.720" style="s2">the sake of it I think I agree with him</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:04.829" style="s2">on that that actually if I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.720" end="00:40:06.750" style="s2">put a criticism to you it should be</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.829" end="00:40:11.339" style="s2">something that I actually think deserves</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.750" end="00:40:14.279" style="s2">a response and I do think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.339" end="00:40:16.829" style="s2">criticisms of you are not true that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.279" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">they&#39;re bad badly intent intentioned and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.829" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">I think I think you&#39;re right in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:21.660" style="s2">terms of being an apple state that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:25.740" style="s2">something that people really really</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.660" end="00:40:27.240" style="s2">riles people but even Sam Harris has</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.740" end="00:40:28.289" style="s2">said in the past that he thinks that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.240" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">might have been captured by your</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.289" end="00:40:31.500" style="s2">audience and I feel that as well just in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:34.109" style="s2">the pieces that we&#39;re putting out</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.500" end="00:40:36.119" style="s2">YouTube has a certain bias and I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.109" end="00:40:38.849" style="s2">feel it&#39;s something that Eric had said</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.119" end="00:40:41.720" style="s2">that the members of the IDW are free</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.849" end="00:40:44.220" style="s2">because they are independent of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.720" end="00:40:46.829" style="s2">organizations I don&#39;t actually buy that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.220" end="00:40:48.210" style="s2">because there is there&#39;s a huge pull in</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.829" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">terms of the audience in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.210" end="00:40:54.180" style="s2">they want what do you think of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:55.890" style="s2">criticism by Sam well well I I know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.180" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">was in an article and something or other</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.890" end="00:41:00.599" style="s2">I forget what it was in look I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:02.819" style="s2">at some level everyone that has an</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.599" end="00:41:04.950" style="s2">audience could have some level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.819" end="00:41:06.569" style="s2">audience capture so I&#39;m sure I could say</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.950" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">that about anybody I could could I tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.569" end="00:41:11.640" style="s2">you that Jordan maybe has some level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:13.259" style="s2">audience capture does Ben have some look</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.640" end="00:41:15.509" style="s2">Ben&#39;s audience loves it when he destroys</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.259" end="00:41:17.009" style="s2">a leftist on a college campus so is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.509" end="00:41:18.630" style="s2">something that he might do more of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.009" end="00:41:20.339" style="s2">even if he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.630" end="00:41:23.819" style="s2">high intellectual work he could do</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.339" end="00:41:25.950" style="s2">perhaps if Sam makes some joke about</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.819" end="00:41:28.890" style="s2">religion is that gonna get atheists who</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.950" end="00:41:31.019" style="s2">laugh probably so we could all play that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.890" end="00:41:33.240" style="s2">game so without getting into the real</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.019" end="00:41:35.220" style="s2">nitty-gritty of that I would say look if</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.240" end="00:41:36.990" style="s2">I really if I cared about audience</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.220" end="00:41:38.730" style="s2">capture to the point where I wanted this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.990" end="00:41:41.250" style="s2">just to be about garnering a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.730" end="00:41:42.750" style="s2">audience to make more money and all and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.250" end="00:41:45.089" style="s2">that sort of thing I mean look at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.750" end="00:41:46.500" style="s2">way we treat our YouTube channel I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.089" end="00:41:48.539" style="s2">you should anyone watching this could go</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.500" end="00:41:50.910" style="s2">look and we don&#39;t do clickbait we</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.539" end="00:41:52.859" style="s2">intentionally do things that I know</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.910" end="00:41:54.359" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get us less views which</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.859" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">will ultimately get us less subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.359" end="00:41:58.650" style="s2">but we treat the channel and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:01.410" style="s2">material that we put out the same way I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.650" end="00:42:03.420" style="s2">treat the conversations here so audience</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.410" end="00:42:04.799" style="s2">capture I don&#39;t know really</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.420" end="00:42:07.349" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that means I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.799" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2">how I I truly I don&#39;t know how I could</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.349" end="00:42:13.380" style="s2">be more honest with my audience than I</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.530" end="00:42:15.089" style="s2">am being when I don&#39;t know something I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.380" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">am willing to admit that and I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.089" end="00:42:25.230" style="s2">to explore certain ideas so I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:27.540" style="s2">there&#39;s no way that that can be answered</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.230" end="00:42:31.470" style="s2">that I think really can give a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.540" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">satisfying answer other than I am truly</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.470" end="00:42:35.220" style="s2">doing what I think is right if people</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:38.369" style="s2">want to watch if they want to support</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.220" end="00:42:40.710" style="s2">they can can I tell you that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.369" end="00:42:42.900" style="s2">level of audience capture that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.710" end="00:42:44.790" style="s2">subconsciously can&#39;t even explain well</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.900" end="00:42:46.470" style="s2">the political PTSD you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.790" end="00:42:47.849" style="s2">before they&#39;re kind of more focused on</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.470" end="00:42:50.069" style="s2">the left well of course I&#39;m more focused</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.849" end="00:42:52.380" style="s2">on the left I believe that this that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.069" end="00:42:54.510" style="s2">modern left that the postmodern leftist</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.380" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">which now have taken over academia which</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.510" end="00:42:57.210" style="s2">have taken over the media which have</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:59.160" style="s2">taken over the political establishment</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.210" end="00:43:02.010" style="s2">of the Democrats I believe that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.160" end="00:43:04.049" style="s2">without question the biggest threat to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.010" end="00:43:06.119" style="s2">individual freedom to Liberty and to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.049" end="00:43:07.950" style="s2">human prosperity that exist that is far</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.119" end="00:43:10.349" style="s2">bigger a threat than I think Donald</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.950" end="00:43:13.140" style="s2">Trump is or even could be I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.349" end="00:43:16.650" style="s2">far bigger threat than the alt-right or</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.140" end="00:43:20.520" style="s2">whatever that is I think this idea not</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.650" end="00:43:22.770" style="s2">to say this this group of ideas based in</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.520" end="00:43:24.180" style="s2">a competing set of interests where we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.770" end="00:43:25.740" style="s2">have to put black people here and gay</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.180" end="00:43:28.589" style="s2">people here and Muslim people here and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.740" end="00:43:32.040" style="s2">trans people here and this ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.589" end="00:43:32.490" style="s2">system that will turn neighbor against</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.380" end="00:43:44.700" style="s2">he has privilege I should treat him this</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.180" end="00:43:46.950" style="s2">way ah here&#39;s a intersectional black</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.700" end="00:43:50.309" style="s2">disabled lesbian she should get this</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.950" end="00:43:52.349" style="s2">it&#39;s the most psychotic set of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.309" end="00:43:54.450" style="s2">that could ever be assembled and it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.349" end="00:43:56.369" style="s2">but in it is a threat now it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.450" end="00:43:58.799" style="s2">actually become a threat to the left so</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.369" end="00:44:00.420" style="s2">if having political PTSD is that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.799" end="00:44:03.150" style="s2">criticize the thing that I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.420" end="00:44:05.579" style="s2">most dangerous to Western society and to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.150" end="00:44:08.010" style="s2">human freedom then I gladly have PTSD I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.579" end="00:44:09.900" style="s2">would say we all focus on certain things</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.010" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">also the funny part of this is no one</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.900" end="00:44:13.650" style="s2">focuses on this in the mainstream so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.480" style="s2">irony is I&#39;m being criticized for</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.650" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">calling out something I suppose that</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:20.809" style="s2">and millions of people are seeing yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:22.970" style="s2">very few are willing to talk about so</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.809" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">they watch these shows often privately</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.970" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">because they don&#39;t even want their</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:30.650" style="s2">to these shows so if I&#39;m focusing there</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.339" end="00:44:33.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t see that as a problem I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.650" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">used if you saw a problem would you just</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.530" end="00:44:36.440" style="s2">talk about it for a month and then be</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:37.819" style="s2">like and then the problem still existed</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.440" end="00:44:39.530" style="s2">or was getting worse I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.819" end="00:44:41.480" style="s2">irony right this thing is getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.530" end="00:44:43.339" style="s2">and worse and worse the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.480" end="00:44:45.799" style="s2">democratic socialism are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.339" end="00:44:47.450" style="s2">stronger so why would I stop talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.799" end="00:44:49.339" style="s2">about them I don&#39;t think that&#39;s audience</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.450" end="00:44:51.530" style="s2">capture I think that&#39;s I see a problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.339" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">and for whatever reason I&#39;m not afraid</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.530" end="00:44:56.329" style="s2">to talk about how to stop it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:57.980" style="s2">yeah and I would agree with you like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.329" end="00:44:59.780" style="s2">overall frame is what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.980" end="00:45:01.490" style="s2">the Reid tribal ization of society and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.780" end="00:45:04.579" style="s2">it&#39;s coming from the left it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.490" end="00:45:06.140" style="s2">from this the intersectional worldview</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.579" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">that is not looking at the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.140" end="00:45:08.990" style="s2">between people but it&#39;s looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">differences between people and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.990" end="00:45:11.059" style="s2">those primarily I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.059" end="00:45:18.170" style="s2">I guess my my genuine concern is and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:19.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve also been on that channel we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.170" end="00:45:21.049" style="s2">been a little bit critical of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.970" end="00:45:24.230" style="s2">Peterson as well because I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.049" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">sometimes his relentless focus and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.230" end="00:45:31.279" style="s2">kind of clear reactivity he can have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:33.619" style="s2">around this stuff can actually be be</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.279" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">more polarizing than than it would need</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.619" end="00:45:39.380" style="s2">to be sometimes and that it that it can</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:41.569" style="s2">be and I guess I&#39;m coming from aspect</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.380" end="00:45:43.309" style="s2">evolve one as a journalist and two as</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.569" end="00:45:45.380" style="s2">someone who&#39;s really looking to see what</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.309" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">is the place beyond all of this all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.380" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">this conflict and my Michael the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:53.380" style="s2">criticisms that I see any view that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.210" style="s2">think have some some validity is</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.380" end="00:45:58.220" style="s2">sometimes you draw this you talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.210" end="00:46:00.230" style="s2">new center evolving but you draw that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.220" end="00:46:01.940" style="s2">new center around some people that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.230" end="00:46:03.470" style="s2">I would consider on the right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.940" end="00:46:04.670" style="s2">Stefan Stefan modern you for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.470" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">well I&#39;ve never said that stefan</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.670" end="00:46:07.549" style="s2">molyneux Zinn the new center i really</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:11.539" style="s2">have you ever heard me say that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.549" end="00:46:12.710" style="s2">thought you had no but people were so</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.539" end="00:46:14.690" style="s2">this is one of the things that people do</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.710" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">before exams another example would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.690" end="00:46:18.859" style="s2">the Katie Hopkins interview yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:20.150" style="s2">Katie Hopkins I mean I know Katie</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.859" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">Hopkins pretty well coming from the UK</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.150" end="00:46:24.500" style="s2">and the way that that interview was</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:26.750" style="s2">framed was that she was sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.500" end="00:46:28.789" style="s2">shut down for in a politically correct</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.750" end="00:46:29.900" style="s2">way but the actual article that she</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.789" end="00:46:31.940" style="s2">wrote was calling from</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.900" end="00:46:35.090" style="s2">gunboats to be used against migrants and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.940" end="00:46:37.400" style="s2">compared them to cockroaches I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.090" end="00:46:39.650" style="s2">was did you know that about the article</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.400" end="00:46:41.840" style="s2">before the interview were we talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.650" end="00:46:43.880" style="s2">about a specific article yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.840" end="00:46:46.790" style="s2">specific article in you had an interview</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.880" end="00:46:47.780" style="s2">with her where it was framed you&#39;ve sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.790" end="00:46:49.070" style="s2">of framed it as that she was</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.780" end="00:46:50.990" style="s2">investigated by the police for this</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.070" end="00:46:53.810" style="s2">article and this article was actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.990" end="00:46:55.730" style="s2">taken down by the paper that produced it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.810" end="00:46:58.010" style="s2">she was interviewed by the police but in</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.730" end="00:47:00.650" style="s2">that article she called for gunboats to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.010" end="00:47:03.380" style="s2">take on migrants and compared them to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.650" end="00:47:04.730" style="s2">cockroaches right so so the interview</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.380" end="00:47:06.860" style="s2">was about two years ago I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.730" end="00:47:08.180" style="s2">remember every specific instance of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.860" end="00:47:11.210" style="s2">interview I mean that&#39;s just that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.180" end="00:47:12.980" style="s2">the truth I see I mean this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.210" end="00:47:15.020" style="s2">the strange things it&#39;s like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.980" end="00:47:16.940" style="s2">calls for more tolerance we should talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.020" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">to people we should interview people we</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.940" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">should sit down with people but then the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:23.810" style="s2">second you actually do it then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:25.490" style="s2">the enemy so it&#39;s like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.810" end="00:47:28.130" style="s2">should all be tolerant of people but now</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.490" end="00:47:29.570" style="s2">can Joe Rogan sit down with Alex Jones</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.130" end="00:47:31.190" style="s2">well a lot of people were really pissed</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.570" end="00:47:33.380" style="s2">about that now did anyone get killed</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.190" end="00:47:35.090" style="s2">because Joe Rogan&#39;s but he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.380" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">criticized for not bringing up the Sandy</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.090" end="00:47:38.270" style="s2">Hook thing and then when he sat down</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">with him again he did bring up the Sandy</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.270" end="00:47:41.750" style="s2">Hook thing you know in a fairly strong</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:44.090" style="s2">way okay and that that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.750" end="00:47:45.380" style="s2">question is that and the criticism that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.090" end="00:47:48.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen is that you don&#39;t push back</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.380" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">hard enough against people when they</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.020" end="00:47:54.050" style="s2">maybe deserve it that you&#39;ve given easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:55.460" style="s2">ride to people listen I would say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.050" end="00:47:57.230" style="s2">interviewing people the way I like to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.460" end="00:47:59.300" style="s2">interview them I like to sit across from</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.230" end="00:48:01.490" style="s2">somebody look them in the eye and figure</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.300" end="00:48:03.080" style="s2">out what their ideas are and if you let</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.490" end="00:48:04.700" style="s2">them talk long enough if they have bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.080" end="00:48:06.140" style="s2">ideas or they don&#39;t know their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.700" end="00:48:08.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve said this a million times you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.140" end="00:48:10.040" style="s2">actually watch them wrap the noose</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.060" end="00:48:13.340" style="s2">around their neck and hang themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.040" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">are there specific instances over the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">course of however many hundreds if not</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:20.150" style="s2">thousands of interviews that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:21.800" style="s2">that maybe I asked a question in too</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.150" end="00:48:23.690" style="s2">much of a leading way or didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.800" end="00:48:26.150" style="s2">perfect follow-up or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.690" end="00:48:27.470" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there are I also have no I of</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.150" end="00:48:29.840" style="s2">being here I don&#39;t have a producer</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.470" end="00:48:31.580" style="s2">yelling at me what to do I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.840" end="00:48:34.130" style="s2">on the fly I very rarely look at my</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.580" end="00:48:35.420" style="s2">notes I&#39;m actually sitting there and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.130" end="00:48:37.030" style="s2">trying to pay attention and do the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.420" end="00:48:40.940" style="s2">follow-up properly in the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.030" end="00:48:43.430" style="s2">could I have asked Stefan Molyneux some</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.940" end="00:48:46.039" style="s2">different questions perhaps I actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.430" end="00:48:47.480" style="s2">and I think I probably prepared for that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.039" end="00:48:49.880" style="s2">interview more thoroughly than I had</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.480" end="00:48:51.589" style="s2">ever prepared for an interview because I</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.880" end="00:48:53.089" style="s2">knew what the fallout was gonna be no</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.589" end="00:48:54.380" style="s2">matter what I did if I did the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.089" end="00:48:55.789" style="s2">job I was still gonna get hate and if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.380" end="00:48:58.339" style="s2">did a horrible job I was gonna get hate</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.789" end="00:48:59.630" style="s2">I think the right question was the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.339" end="00:49:02.990" style="s2">that I repeatedly asked him which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.630" end="00:49:06.829" style="s2">which was why do you care about this I</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.990" end="00:49:09.559" style="s2">thought that was the right question now</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.829" end="00:49:11.779" style="s2">people can say I did a bad job or did a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.559" end="00:49:13.789" style="s2">good job or whatever else I have often</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.779" end="00:49:15.730" style="s2">talked about a new center I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.789" end="00:49:18.259" style="s2">that the new center that I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.730" end="00:49:21.380" style="s2">envision would have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.259" end="00:49:23.599" style="s2">white nationalism just as it would have</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.380" end="00:49:24.799" style="s2">nothing to do with radical left ism so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.599" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know that I have talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.799" end="00:49:29.509" style="s2">phrase new Center but I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:31.609" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever said this specific person is</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.509" end="00:49:37.039" style="s2">part of it what do you say Mike so none</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.609" end="00:49:37.999" style="s2">of it just in the new center I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.039" end="00:49:39.859" style="s2">these are these are the type of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.999" end="00:49:41.450" style="s2">questions that I don&#39;t think are that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.859" end="00:49:42.950" style="s2">productive actually but I mean I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.450" end="00:49:44.809" style="s2">answer it I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.950" end="00:49:46.460" style="s2">productive because if we just start</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.809" end="00:49:49.190" style="s2">drawing lines everywhere and I get it I</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.460" end="00:49:50.749" style="s2">get why people want to draw lines and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.190" end="00:49:51.950" style="s2">get why countries have borders I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.749" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">they&#39;re you can&#39;t just always be</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.950" end="00:49:57.230" style="s2">absolutely open to everything do we want</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">murderers in in the new center or</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.230" end="00:50:00.950" style="s2">something like that of course not I</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:03.289" style="s2">would say someone like Serna vich who</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.950" end="00:50:05.480" style="s2">maybe has done some trolli things or not</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.289" end="00:50:07.369" style="s2">maybe has done some trolli things has</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.900" end="00:50:23.869" style="s2">way that perhaps the IDW couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.869" end="00:50:26.839" style="s2">because we talk about things in a really</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.869" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">decent way and a respectful way and not</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.839" end="00:50:30.920" style="s2">everyone always responds to that so</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:33.170" style="s2">somebody like milo i would view as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.920" end="00:50:35.480" style="s2">necessary piece of all of this because</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.170" end="00:50:38.660" style="s2">milo went in there and in his fabulous</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.480" end="00:50:41.269" style="s2">over-the-top ridiculous way also had an</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.660" end="00:50:42.980" style="s2">incredibly sharp mind and he blew up</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.269" end="00:50:45.079" style="s2">things and we were able to put some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.980" end="00:50:48.019" style="s2">those pieces back together so i would</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.079" end="00:50:49.249" style="s2">say some of those people are necessary i</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.019" end="00:50:51.230" style="s2">would also say that Serna vich has</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.249" end="00:50:54.529" style="s2">really evolved and i would say in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.230" end="00:50:55.800" style="s2">last year I think he&#39;s extremely mod I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.529" end="00:50:58.200" style="s2">would say none Madhuri</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.800" end="00:51:01.860" style="s2">himself but I think he&#39;s he&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.200" end="00:51:05.070" style="s2">something I think much more rich or</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.860" end="00:51:06.750" style="s2">something in the last year or so so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.070" end="00:51:08.040" style="s2">know we could do this litmus test with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.750" end="00:51:10.560" style="s2">the gajillion other people but I always</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.040" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">do think it&#39;s funny people will only ask</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.560" end="00:51:14.520" style="s2">me this about people on the right right</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:16.350" style="s2">so you can ask me well is stefan</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.520" end="00:51:17.820" style="s2">molyneux in the IDW is Serna bitch in</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.350" end="00:51:20.760" style="s2">the new center but no one will say</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.820" end="00:51:22.650" style="s2">anyone no there&#39;s no left that&#39;s too far</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.760" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">left to be considered I&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.650" end="00:51:25.080" style="s2">that question once and even if I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:26.010" style="s2">say I asked you that right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.080" end="00:51:27.780" style="s2">guessing you can&#39;t even come up with</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.010" end="00:51:32.490" style="s2">somebody because that&#39;s just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.780" end="00:51:33.900" style="s2">nature of it so yeah if we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.490" end="00:51:36.570" style="s2">free society you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.900" end="00:51:39.120" style="s2">interact with some people that maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.570" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">don&#39;t love and and maybe over time if</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.120" end="00:51:42.630" style="s2">you do it honestly you might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.130" end="00:51:44.580" style="s2">able to wake them up to some good ideas</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.630" end="00:51:48.750" style="s2">I guess what I&#39;m what I&#39;m saying the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.580" end="00:51:52.500" style="s2">criticism is that do you think that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.750" end="00:51:53.910" style="s2">can sometimes slip into a fairly like</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.500" end="00:51:56.760" style="s2">it&#39;s such a powerful though there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.910" end="00:51:58.950" style="s2">much truth in the idea that the left is</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.760" end="00:52:02.370" style="s2">constraining debate the left is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.950" end="00:52:05.910" style="s2">making certain topics off off off the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.370" end="00:52:07.800" style="s2">off the table that that can turn into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.910" end="00:52:09.540" style="s2">bit of a simplistic narrative that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.800" end="00:52:10.770" style="s2">concern is that if everything is seen</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.540" end="00:52:11.850" style="s2">through that narrative all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.770" end="00:52:14.310" style="s2">the reason I mentioned the Katie Hopkins</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.850" end="00:52:15.840" style="s2">piece is that I thought I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.310" end="00:52:17.490" style="s2">you if you&#39;d read the article before</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.840" end="00:52:19.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve had her on but I did I did think</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.490" end="00:52:21.030" style="s2">the way that it was framed made it sound</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.500" end="00:52:24.750" style="s2">like she was some free speech martyr</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.030" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">whereas actually the language she was</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.750" end="00:52:28.530" style="s2">using I feel hugely uncomfortable with I</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:30.900" style="s2">know Jordan Peterson for example talks</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.530" end="00:52:33.450" style="s2">about the danger of framing people in</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.900" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">disgust language like he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.450" end="00:52:37.170" style="s2">kind of Hitler used to do that talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:39.150" style="s2">about people as vermin or as cockroaches</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.170" end="00:52:40.980" style="s2">and she&#39;d done that in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.150" end="00:52:42.840" style="s2">article is one kind of coming back right</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.980" end="00:52:44.610" style="s2">so I would say this so we could I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.840" end="00:52:46.530" style="s2">answer it this way let&#39;s and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.610" end="00:52:48.540" style="s2">overall point I&#39;m making do you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.530" end="00:52:51.720" style="s2">you can sometimes have a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.540" end="00:52:55.230" style="s2">frame things in a way that is that is in</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.720" end="00:53:00.990" style="s2">some sense laundering people with much</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.230" end="00:53:04.070" style="s2">were much worse views or very like Katie</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.990" end="00:53:07.110" style="s2">Hopkins very difficult or very</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.070" end="00:53:07.840" style="s2">reprehensible views I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.110" end="00:53:09.550" style="s2">helped</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.840" end="00:53:11.860" style="s2">launder anyone&#39;s views to make their</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.550" end="00:53:13.390" style="s2">nefarious views let&#39;s say any more</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.860" end="00:53:15.250" style="s2">palatable I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.390" end="00:53:16.870" style="s2">let&#39;s pretend though that the Katie</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.250" end="00:53:18.970" style="s2">enter the Katie Hopkins interview they</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.870" end="00:53:21.310" style="s2">did was literally the worst interview</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.970" end="00:53:23.800" style="s2">ever let&#39;s pretend I just grant you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.310" end="00:53:26.650" style="s2">this was a V I just completely dropped</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.800" end="00:53:29.320" style="s2">the ball I misunderstood something and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.650" end="00:53:31.300" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s a true racist and all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.320" end="00:53:33.460" style="s2">these things I&#39;ve done hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.300" end="00:53:35.200" style="s2">interviews I would say if you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.460" end="00:53:37.420" style="s2">everyone gets one I would say you get</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.200" end="00:53:38.920" style="s2">one or two so you know when people focus</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.420" end="00:53:41.620" style="s2">on the two or three little things that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.920" end="00:53:44.050" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like okay you know it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.620" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">the nature of how everyone views</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.050" end="00:53:47.740" style="s2">conversation these days because again I</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:49.180" style="s2">said everyone talks about tolerance but</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.740" end="00:53:50.740" style="s2">they don&#39;t really mean it they mean it</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.180" end="00:53:54.100" style="s2">they mean to be tolerant for the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.740" end="00:53:56.350" style="s2">that you like and I&#39;ve tried to perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.100" end="00:53:58.150" style="s2">because of the PTSD of the left because</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.350" end="00:53:59.620" style="s2">the left has become so hysterical have I</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.150" end="00:54:02.440" style="s2">been a little friendlier maybe with</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.620" end="00:54:04.510" style="s2">people on the right that that maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.440" end="00:54:05.710" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been years ago perhaps but</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.510" end="00:54:08.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t regret any of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.710" end="00:54:09.370" style="s2">conversations I don&#39;t no one got hurt</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.110" end="00:54:11.380" style="s2">because of any of those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.370" end="00:54:12.700" style="s2">you know what&#39;s funny after the mob the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.380" end="00:54:14.710" style="s2">molyneux one which you know people</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.700" end="00:54:16.780" style="s2">criticize me for all the time I got a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.710" end="00:54:18.970" style="s2">lot of emails from people saying that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.780" end="00:54:20.920" style="s2">you know they had heard about him sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.970" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">of and then when I had him on and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.920" end="00:54:22.810" style="s2">asked him these questions that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:25.270" style="s2">actually just weren&#39;t that impressed</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.810" end="00:54:26.890" style="s2">with them so it&#39;s not like you get you</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.270" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">sit down with someone and automatically</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.890" end="00:54:31.600" style="s2">you strengthen them there&#39;s no automatic</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:34.360" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll be strengthened if their</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.600" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">ideas are good and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.360" end="00:54:37.210" style="s2">ever argue that you shouldn&#39;t sit down</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:39.100" style="s2">with someone I think my main point is</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.210" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">whether people are being challenged</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.100" end="00:54:44.950" style="s2">enough because and that goes back to my</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:47.860" style="s2">point before about has has it shifted</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.950" end="00:54:49.360" style="s2">because because now there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.860" end="00:54:50.650" style="s2">expectations I mean we&#39;re seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.360" end="00:54:52.060" style="s2">for Joe Rogan I think we&#39;re seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.650" end="00:54:53.710" style="s2">with you as well that there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.060" end="00:54:55.450" style="s2">expectations that you will hold people</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.710" end="00:54:57.160" style="s2">to account in a way that when you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.450" end="00:54:59.560" style="s2">upstart kind of alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.160" end="00:55:01.510" style="s2">channel yes we&#39;re not there right so as</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.560" end="00:55:03.100" style="s2">I said earlier look the bigger you get</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.510" end="00:55:04.540" style="s2">the more relevant you get the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.100" end="00:55:06.100" style="s2">haters are gonna come out but the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.540" end="00:55:07.990" style="s2">that legitimate criticism will come out</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.100" end="00:55:08.920" style="s2">too and again I address this all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.990" end="00:55:14.950" style="s2">time what do you think is the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.920" end="00:55:16.900" style="s2">legitimate criticism it&#39;s not really for</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.950" end="00:55:19.090" style="s2">me to say what the legitimate criticism</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:20.560" style="s2">of me if someone wants to say that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.090" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">don&#39;t like the way I interview</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.560" end="00:55:23.500" style="s2">that I don&#39;t ask hard enough questions</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:25.840" style="s2">or something like that well I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.500" end="00:55:28.180" style="s2">that is a legitimate criticism of me</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.840" end="00:55:30.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not the way I like doing my</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.180" end="00:55:31.450" style="s2">business and you know if you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.190" end="00:55:32.890" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing then I would say you</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.450" end="00:55:34.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have to watch doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.860" end="00:55:39.430" style="s2">apparently a lot of other people think</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.330" end="00:55:42.190" style="s2">it&#39;s good too and and apparently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.430" end="00:55:44.800" style="s2">pretty rare these days so within that if</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.190" end="00:55:47.290" style="s2">I don&#39;t do it exactly how someone wants</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.800" end="00:55:49.300" style="s2">well I guess that&#39;s just that&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.290" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">life works but yes we are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.300" end="00:55:55.870" style="s2">scrutinized more and I don&#39;t mind I</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">don&#39;t mind scrutiny so I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.870" end="00:56:00.850" style="s2">a it&#39;s a function of success which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:03.130" style="s2">which is good since the IDW is announced</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.850" end="00:56:06.010" style="s2">in probably maybe it&#39;s just over a year</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.130" end="00:56:07.480" style="s2">ago do you how has it evolved and how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.010" end="00:56:10.360" style="s2">you feel that your position within it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.480" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">has evolved well there is definitely an</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.360" end="00:56:13.990" style="s2">interesting moment for the IDW on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:15.610" style="s2">horizon as we roll into the 2020</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.990" end="00:56:17.860" style="s2">election because you know I think we</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.610" end="00:56:20.020" style="s2">have people now let&#39;s say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.860" end="00:56:24.130" style="s2">certain set which I would say probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.020" end="00:56:26.770" style="s2">is ben shapiro jordan peterson myself</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.130" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">maybe douglas mari that are a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.770" end="00:56:31.510" style="s2">more right-leaning at this point right</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:33.520" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the the other side</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.510" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">which I said would say is the Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.520" end="00:56:36.430" style="s2">brothers and Sam and a couple other</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:38.200" style="s2">people that are maybe a little more</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.430" end="00:56:40.810" style="s2">left-leaning now what&#39;s gonna happen is</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.200" end="00:56:43.870" style="s2">I think as we get as we roll towards the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.810" end="00:56:46.870" style="s2">election of 2020 it&#39;s fairly obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.870" end="00:56:48.940" style="s2">me that the left for all intents and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.870" end="00:56:51.370" style="s2">purposes and I don&#39;t mean every leftist</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.940" end="00:56:52.810" style="s2">obviously but the apparatus of the left</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.370" end="00:56:56.020" style="s2">and the media and the political</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.810" end="00:56:57.760" style="s2">establishment they&#39;ve bought into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.020" end="00:56:59.530" style="s2">socialist Democrat view of the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.760" end="00:57:02.230" style="s2">they&#39;ve bought into this postmodern view</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.530" end="00:57:03.700" style="s2">of the world now could any of us that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.230" end="00:57:06.280" style="s2">are that are loosely affiliated with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.700" end="00:57:10.540" style="s2">IDF with the IDW could any of us</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.280" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">possibly vote for one of those people I</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.540" end="00:57:14.170" style="s2">don&#39;t see how that would be remotely</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">possible every single idea that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.170" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">putting out is the antithesis of</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:19.900" style="s2">everything that we&#39;ve talked about here</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:22.390" style="s2">I mean everything that we&#39;ve discussed</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.900" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">that the IDW has talked about for lascal</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.390" end="00:57:26.680" style="s2">years has been against identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.510" style="s2">has been against these group</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.680" end="00:57:30.250" style="s2">associations and collectivism and all</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.510" end="00:57:32.500" style="s2">that now one side is really veering</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.250" end="00:57:33.870" style="s2">towards that the other side whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.500" end="00:57:35.910" style="s2">think of Trump is in</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.870" end="00:57:37.320" style="s2">estimation is not really veering towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.910" end="00:57:39.150" style="s2">that so I think there&#39;s gonna be an</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.320" end="00:57:41.100" style="s2">interesting moment for the IDW where</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.150" end="00:57:43.110" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be like all right because</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.100" end="00:57:44.940" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;ve been lefties and Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.110" end="00:57:47.910" style="s2">our whole lives or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.940" end="00:57:50.070" style="s2">well now can we possibly have to vote in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.910" end="00:57:51.360" style="s2">a different direction and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.070" end="00:57:52.050" style="s2">gonna be a very hard pill for some</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.360" end="00:57:53.850" style="s2">people as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.050" end="00:57:55.170" style="s2">that being said whether we all end up</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.850" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">voting for different people are the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.170" end="00:57:57.750" style="s2">person or anything else I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.270" style="s2">we&#39;ll continue those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.750" end="00:58:02.130" style="s2">respectfully but I do think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.270" end="00:58:04.650" style="s2">there is an interesting split in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.130" end="00:58:06.450" style="s2">regard I don&#39;t the last little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.650" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">the guys that are saying the left is</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.450" end="00:58:09.660" style="s2">salvageable I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:11.190" style="s2">evidence for it I think there&#39;s a plenty</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.660" end="00:58:14.100" style="s2">there are there&#39;s plenty of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.190" end="00:58:16.620" style="s2">that there&#39;s no nothing salvageable left</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.100" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">so we shall see and this I guess is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.620" end="00:58:22.080" style="s2">sort of the broader context of what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:24.030" style="s2">see from the outside is there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.080" end="00:58:26.850" style="s2">like an America has is almost like</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.030" end="00:58:29.220" style="s2">machine for creating polarization even</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.850" end="00:58:32.340" style="s2">when something like the IDW is conceived</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.220" end="00:58:35.040" style="s2">as a space to hold the center it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.340" end="00:58:36.420" style="s2">fraction eighths and I guess the sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.040" end="00:58:37.620" style="s2">you you just said that you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.420" end="00:58:40.800" style="s2">feeling yourself pulled in one direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.620" end="00:58:43.580" style="s2">during it almost like the logic of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.800" end="00:58:47.850" style="s2">logic of the culture war now is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.580" end="00:58:51.450" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s just always splitting well I</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.850" end="00:58:53.850" style="s2">would say the logical answer if you care</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.450" end="00:58:55.350" style="s2">about the ability to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.850" end="00:58:57.710" style="s2">things we&#39;ve been talking about related</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.350" end="00:59:01.350" style="s2">to science and related to gender and</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.710" end="00:59:02.550" style="s2">related to climate or political</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.350" end="00:59:04.590" style="s2">conversation any of those things</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.550" end="00:59:07.350" style="s2">there is it is obvious to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.590" end="00:59:09.090" style="s2">road right now as it is whether I want</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.350" end="00:59:11.940" style="s2">this to be or not the reality is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.090" end="00:59:14.010" style="s2">the road right now is clearly veering</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.940" end="00:59:15.240" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not going far</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.010" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">right and somehow we&#39;re gonna become</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.240" end="00:59:18.600" style="s2">ethno nationalists and racists that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:20.520" style="s2">everything we&#39;re fighting against but</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.600" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">the road where we&#39;re gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.520" end="00:59:24.420" style="s2">have these conversations is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:26.460" style="s2">going right right now</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.420" end="00:59:28.110" style="s2">now you may really want it to go left</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.460" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">and you may be holding on to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.110" end="00:59:32.910" style="s2">steering wheel as hard as possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:35.970" style="s2">not that it can&#39;t go Center but I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.910" end="00:59:37.740" style="s2">sometimes if right now where we exist we</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.970" end="00:59:39.150" style="s2">can see some conservatives that are open</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.740" end="00:59:40.860" style="s2">to talking about ideas and we can see</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.150" end="00:59:42.630" style="s2">some libertarians who are open to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.860" end="00:59:44.490" style="s2">talking about it is why not talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.630" end="00:59:46.550" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to do it so that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.490" end="00:59:49.070" style="s2">going to shift us I would say a little</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.550" end="00:59:50.900" style="s2">right now when you say right people some</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.070" end="00:59:52.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a association that</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.900" end="00:59:54.410" style="s2">that somehow means authoritarian or</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.430" end="00:59:56.030" style="s2">scary what I would say right means is</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.410" end="00:59:58.340" style="s2">basically you believe in individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.030" end="01:00:00.200" style="s2">freedom and you believe in human liberty</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.340" end="01:00:01.490" style="s2">and limited government those are all</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.200" end="01:00:03.140" style="s2">good things that are completely</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.490" end="01:00:05.540" style="s2">congruent with all the ideas that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.140" end="01:00:06.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about here but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.540" end="01:00:10.190" style="s2">interestingly you know when the article</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.980" end="01:00:11.510" style="s2">about the IDW came out you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.190" end="01:00:12.800" style="s2">when this thing really leveled up</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.510" end="01:00:14.900" style="s2">because finally it was in the New York</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.800" end="01:00:16.220" style="s2">Times so now you get the political</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.900" end="01:00:17.870" style="s2">establishment and the media</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.220" end="01:00:20.570" style="s2">establishment care and it was suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.870" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">like within within 24 hours of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.570" end="01:00:24.710" style="s2">article coming out the amount of hit</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:26.900" style="s2">piece is written on us were we&#39;re insane</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.710" end="01:00:29.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s like ah so this really is how</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.900" end="01:00:30.560" style="s2">you guys operate we&#39;re out there we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.240" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">building audiences we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.560" end="01:00:34.430" style="s2">interesting conversations we&#39;re agreeing</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:36.500" style="s2">we&#39;re disagreeing and it&#39;s just building</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.430" end="01:00:39.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s all actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.500" end="01:00:40.940" style="s2">pleasant and decent then we get in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.620" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">New York Times and next thing you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.940" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">all of the the usual suspects start</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:49.490" style="s2">coming out of the woodwork and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:52.010" style="s2">we&#39;re racists and it&#39;s a group of white</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.490" end="01:00:53.780" style="s2">men and all of this nonsense and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.010" end="01:00:55.490" style="s2">like all you guys really do is just</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.780" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">react to things that are that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.490" end="01:00:59.300" style="s2">different than you you&#39;re proving our</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:01:01.340" style="s2">point yeah I guess that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.300" end="01:01:04.430" style="s2">central point is that the paradox of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.340" end="01:01:07.130" style="s2">IDW is that let&#39;s create a space beyond</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.430" end="01:01:09.530" style="s2">polarization immediately in the American</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.130" end="01:01:11.480" style="s2">context becomes polarizing itself almost</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.530" end="01:01:13.220" style="s2">straight away so I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.480" end="01:01:18.620" style="s2">probably a commentary more on just</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.220" end="01:01:20.600" style="s2">American political establishment or sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.620" end="01:01:23.150" style="s2">of media establishment more than the IDW</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.600" end="01:01:25.010" style="s2">itself I think all we could do and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.150" end="01:01:27.050" style="s2">would suspect if you ask this question</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.010" end="01:01:28.790" style="s2">to to any of the crew that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.050" end="01:01:31.910" style="s2">about here I think most of them would</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.790" end="01:01:33.380" style="s2">say I&#39;m interested in either doing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.910" end="01:01:35.590" style="s2">research that I want to do or having the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.380" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">conversations that I want to have or</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.590" end="01:01:39.860" style="s2">interacting with a certain type of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:42.260" style="s2">person or whatever it is or you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.860" end="01:01:43.700" style="s2">maybe eventually writing laws that will</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.260" end="01:01:49.490" style="s2">lead to more freedom or whatever else</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.700" end="01:01:52.430" style="s2">and and that&#39;s it but I would say in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.490" end="01:01:54.590" style="s2">in the broad sense what is that can that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.430" end="01:01:57.620" style="s2">exist forever I don&#39;t know if it can</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.590" end="01:01:59.210" style="s2">exist forever but I would I just think</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.620" end="01:02:01.220" style="s2">we have to just keep moving</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.210" end="01:02:02.810" style="s2">that&#39;s it if we just keep every week I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.220" end="01:02:05.480" style="s2">try to do a show that I feel is relevant</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.810" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s honest and is the best show</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.480" end="01:02:11.089" style="s2">that I can do and I think that that has</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:12.530" style="s2">worth to people and you know if in five</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.089" end="01:02:13.880" style="s2">years from now there&#39;s 20 other people</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.530" end="01:02:16.430" style="s2">that are doing this better than me I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.880" end="01:02:18.589" style="s2">find something else to do and who who</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.430" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">are the figures on the left that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.589" end="01:02:23.690" style="s2">think are capable of having these kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:25.369" style="s2">of conversations that you would because</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.690" end="01:02:26.869" style="s2">because one of them oh I see well this</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.369" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">well here&#39;s the irony right so I could</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.869" end="01:02:30.589" style="s2">so who are the people on the left that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:32.869" style="s2">can have these conversations well Sam</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.589" end="01:02:34.130" style="s2">Harris is on the left right but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.869" end="01:02:36.170" style="s2">not really what you mean right</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.130" end="01:02:38.750" style="s2">Bret Weinstein is on the left but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.170" end="01:02:39.950" style="s2">not way when is recline Eric why is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.750" end="01:02:42.890" style="s2">on left but that&#39;s not what you mean as</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.950" end="01:02:44.150" style="s2">recline I mean you know I suppose if he</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.890" end="01:02:46.220" style="s2">wants to have a conversation with me</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.150" end="01:02:49.160" style="s2">sure but you know I view him basically</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.220" end="01:02:50.150" style="s2">as a bad actor in this space I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.160" end="01:02:52.339" style="s2">could watch you could listen to his</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.150" end="01:02:54.560" style="s2">podcast with Sam but but even more than</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.339" end="01:02:57.130" style="s2">that when that ridiculous data and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.560" end="01:02:59.570" style="s2">society alternative influencer Network</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.130" end="01:03:01.640" style="s2">study came out which was not a study it</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.570" end="01:03:03.170" style="s2">was just a bunch of names with arrows</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.640" end="01:03:04.910" style="s2">drawing drawn to people where there were</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.170" end="01:03:06.380" style="s2">many mistakes by the way and the whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.910" end="01:03:07.880" style="s2">idea was that it was trying to link all</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.380" end="01:03:09.770" style="s2">of us to the all right and to real</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.880" end="01:03:12.230" style="s2">racist and they were trying to prove</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.770" end="01:03:13.849" style="s2">somehow that by watching ben shapiro or</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.230" end="01:03:14.869" style="s2">Jordan Pederson or Dave Rubin people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.849" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">shifted to the right now they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.869" end="01:03:18.260" style="s2">actually done some follow-up studies Tim</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:19.849" style="s2">Poole has done a video on one where they</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.260" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">actually proved that by watching our</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.849" end="01:03:24.470" style="s2">shows mostly we&#39;ve moderated people the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:26.300" style="s2">other way but Ezra tweeted out that</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.470" end="01:03:28.430" style="s2">article and even tweeted that this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.300" end="01:03:29.570" style="s2">for Dave Rubin that he was tweeting so I</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.430" end="01:03:31.790" style="s2">don&#39;t view him as someone that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.570" end="01:03:34.040" style="s2">particularly good actor in this space</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.790" end="01:03:35.869" style="s2">you mentioned the alternative influencer</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.040" end="01:03:37.640" style="s2">report that&#39;s the Becca Lewis report I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.869" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">think yeah it was really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.640" end="01:03:43.070" style="s2">reading that how they seem to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:45.320" style="s2">you more than just about anyone else in</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.070" end="01:03:47.960" style="s2">that report yeah why do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.320" end="01:03:50.210" style="s2">is well I think as an interviewer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.960" end="01:03:52.070" style="s2">going to sit down with the most people</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.210" end="01:03:53.570" style="s2">now Brett Weinstein for example may sit</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.070" end="01:03:55.460" style="s2">down with some of us but it&#39;s not his</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.570" end="01:03:57.080" style="s2">job to sit down with people so as an</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.460" end="01:03:59.089" style="s2">interviewer I&#39;m gonna sit down but as</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.080" end="01:04:01.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve said many times look Larry King who</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.089" end="01:04:03.200" style="s2">again this is my mentor and I think is</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.070" end="01:04:07.460" style="s2">the best interviewer of all time in his</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.200" end="01:04:10.730" style="s2">heyday so picture 1991 CNN primetime</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.460" end="01:04:11.760" style="s2">Monday Magic Johnson Tuesday the cast of</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.730" end="01:04:14.670" style="s2">friends</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.150" end="01:04:22.020" style="s2">anyone think he endorsed all of these</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.590" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">views or liked all of these people</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.020" end="01:04:25.560" style="s2">no nobody you would have to be out of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:28.050" style="s2">your mind to think that somehow now if</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.560" end="01:04:30.420" style="s2">you sit down with someone in 91 that was</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.050" end="01:04:31.740" style="s2">okay now in 2000 idea if you sit down</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.420" end="01:04:33.150" style="s2">with something you obviously love them</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.740" end="01:04:36.630" style="s2">and endorse all their views it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.150" end="01:04:39.119" style="s2">actually completely bananas I think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.630" end="01:04:42.359" style="s2">perhaps I&#39;m most focused on in that in</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.119" end="01:04:44.280" style="s2">that data and society report partly</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.359" end="01:04:46.500" style="s2">because I&#39;m an interviewer but also I in</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.280" end="01:04:48.090" style="s2">a weird way and this is this is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.500" end="01:04:49.560" style="s2">even think I&#39;ve ever said this before</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.090" end="01:04:51.869" style="s2">and I don&#39;t take any great pleasure in</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.560" end="01:04:54.450" style="s2">this I&#39;m the biggest threat to these</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.869" end="01:04:57.390" style="s2">people I have walked away from the left</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.450" end="01:04:59.310" style="s2">and survived I have no desire anymore to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.390" end="01:05:02.750" style="s2">reform them they can go and do their</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.310" end="01:05:05.250" style="s2">thing what I see is a rich decent</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.750" end="01:05:08.070" style="s2">basically honest and open center right</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.250" end="01:05:11.310" style="s2">that I think could truly be a good</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.070" end="01:05:13.050" style="s2">future for America and I&#39;m willing to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.310" end="01:05:14.580" style="s2">there and do that and I never get hate</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.050" end="01:05:16.440" style="s2">from them they can agree to disagree</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.580" end="01:05:18.420" style="s2">they keep inviting me places where I</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.440" end="01:05:20.670" style="s2">tell them my differences with them and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.420" end="01:05:21.900" style="s2">go to college gigs too conservative</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.670" end="01:05:23.609" style="s2">events and I go if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.900" end="01:05:25.260" style="s2">disagreement come up first and guess</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.609" end="01:05:27.570" style="s2">what we always do it respectfully and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.260" end="01:05:29.430" style="s2">shake hands at the end so in a weird way</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.570" end="01:05:32.580" style="s2">I&#39;m a threat to them because I&#39;ve shown</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.430" end="01:05:35.010" style="s2">my life experience which is not audience</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.580" end="01:05:37.440" style="s2">capture it&#39;s it&#39;s who I am my life</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.010" end="01:05:39.810" style="s2">experience has shown you can escape and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.440" end="01:05:41.580" style="s2">you will be okay and that is the last</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.810" end="01:05:44.580" style="s2">thing they want to show because because</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.580" end="01:05:46.770" style="s2">leftism has become as Peter Bogosian</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.580" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">said on this show it has become a</p>
