<p begin="00:00:53.449" end="00:01:00.830" style="s2">can do but there&#39;s wondering if there</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.820" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">were some questions in the space or in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.830" end="00:01:08.900" style="s2">your imagination a lot of or irritations</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:12.049" style="s2">it&#39;s always it&#39;s always irritations</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.900" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">answering irritations is always a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.049" end="00:01:19.369" style="s2">way to go somewhere that we haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:22.390" style="s2">or just queries or for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.369" end="00:01:26.480" style="s2">haven&#39;t been here before if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.390" end="00:01:28.790" style="s2">jump in and give us some idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.480" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">you might be interested in I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.790" end="00:01:32.900" style="s2">start with just kind of getting a sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:36.680" style="s2">of who we are today which is different</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.900" end="00:01:39.680" style="s2">than who we were last week I&#39;m different</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.680" end="00:01:43.190" style="s2">from who we were a minute ago so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:48.110" style="s2">just let that feed this space for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.190" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">next five or ten minutes okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.110" end="00:01:54.409" style="s2">good one yes so then so someone just</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:56.720" style="s2">asked to think about talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.409" end="00:01:59.870" style="s2">about the levels of the animation we</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.720" end="00:02:01.880" style="s2">talked about that last week so I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.870" end="00:02:03.590" style="s2">appreciate when when people ask a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.880" end="00:02:05.930" style="s2">question like that because I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.590" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">necessarily revisit it to go into more</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.930" end="00:02:10.310" style="s2">detail unless there was energy for it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">that&#39;s something we can certainly talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.310" end="00:02:24.139" style="s2">about okay curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">conversation okay so well I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.139" end="00:02:29.240" style="s2">recently bumped to the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:34.370" style="s2">space so I don&#39;t know I should frame</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.240" end="00:02:39.740" style="s2">that way basically we have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.370" end="00:02:44.110" style="s2">to have each session be work like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.740" end="00:02:47.300" style="s2">one-off so that people new people can</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.110" end="00:02:49.670" style="s2">participate get the whole get a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.300" end="00:02:51.740" style="s2">package but there is a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.670" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">there&#39;s you know we&#39;re building on</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.740" end="00:03:01.340" style="s2">themes we&#39;re building a certain capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.920" end="00:03:06.290" style="s2">so if you&#39;re a new person please ask me</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.340" end="00:03:08.050" style="s2">to recapitulate or go over any terms or</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.290" end="00:03:11.900" style="s2">something that you hear in the space</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.050" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">that that you&#39;re not interested the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.900" end="00:03:20.810" style="s2">conversation is very broad we&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">looking at things like trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.810" end="00:03:26.240" style="s2">the bones the bare bones of things so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:30.490" style="s2">the bare bones of experience what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.240" end="00:03:30.490" style="s2">under the hood the bare bones of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:38.360" style="s2">metacognitive way to look at our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:43.240" style="s2">mind the bare bones of complex terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.360" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">like power trust etc so we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.240" end="00:03:54.710" style="s2">have a powerful direct conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.150" end="00:03:57.620" style="s2">around topics or themes that have become</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.710" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">very complex if I&#39;d in the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.620" end="00:04:05.960" style="s2">space and then how can we get to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:08.570" style="s2">kind of crisp simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.960" end="00:04:10.280" style="s2">understanding things like we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.570" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">this a lot with some of the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.280" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">techniques so that then we can start</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:18.980" style="s2">from a kind of a clean sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:21.350" style="s2">something and then you can build up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.980" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">complexify from there so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.350" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">kind of what I think we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.610" end="00:04:35.690" style="s2">take a lot of the out of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.680" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">conversation and yeah trying to get down</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.690" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">to brass tacks so let&#39;s look at some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">questions how much fertilizer</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.419" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">mapping tracking and hacking okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.349" end="00:04:58.810" style="s2">do that I have to write them down</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.910" end="00:05:02.410" style="s2">because I can&#39;t watch tracking and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.810" end="00:05:04.750" style="s2">hacking those are really good in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.410" end="00:05:10.289" style="s2">sense make your space conversation going</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.750" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">so let&#39;s make a web ecology now so</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.289" end="00:05:18.490" style="s2">that&#39;s so like us to go meta on our own</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">emerging process but we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.490" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">that the ecology here okay so let me do</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.419" style="s2">this let me talk about this sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">ecology first because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.419" end="00:05:37.539" style="s2">answers like what&#39;s the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:39.789" style="s2">here and then we&#39;ll look at revisit the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.539" end="00:05:43.720" style="s2">notion of systems thinking what gets Dee</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.789" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">animated and then we&#39;ll say that instead</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.720" end="00:05:49.169" style="s2">of system thinking what we can can we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:51.880" style="s2">and David Chandler has a book called</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.169" end="00:05:54.190" style="s2">until politics in he says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.880" end="00:05:58.300" style="s2">different ways to do systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.190" end="00:06:02.380" style="s2">and we can look at mapping tracking and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.300" end="00:06:06.699" style="s2">hacking and so that kind of that will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.380" end="00:06:15.009" style="s2">our narrative arc today the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.699" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">space I think you know it&#39;s just talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.009" end="00:06:23.940" style="s2">to Peter about this and and from my own</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">experience I think there&#39;s Stella</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.940" end="00:06:31.210" style="s2">we were talking about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">between tribes mimetic tribes and what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.210" end="00:06:40.469" style="s2">call totems in my work I say build</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">totems not tribes so tribal is all about</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.469" end="00:06:48.130" style="s2">collective memes let&#39;s say meme escapes</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:50.409" style="s2">in the early tribals cultures they</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.130" end="00:06:52.330" style="s2">weren&#39;t just humans into subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.409" end="00:06:54.670" style="s2">collectives they were actually tribal</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.330" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">clans and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.670" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">cleanse the totem included not only</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:04.420" style="s2">humans some humans and not others but</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:06.760" style="s2">also the landscape and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.420" end="00:07:10.690" style="s2">plants and animals that were part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.760" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">their diet and the sacred parts of their</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.690" end="00:07:15.250" style="s2">spirituality and the tools and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:18.610" style="s2">technologies they they work so you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.250" end="00:07:21.940" style="s2">have the forest clan or the river clan</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.610" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">were fishermen and so this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.940" end="00:07:30.010" style="s2">broadening it from just tribal and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:32.950" style="s2">mimetics nomadic warfare to what is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.010" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">stoah as a totem that stores a totem is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.950" end="00:07:38.230" style="s2">a platform it&#39;s a place right it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:43.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what Peter says it&#39;s a place to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.230" end="00:07:46.570" style="s2">have conversations and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.560" end="00:07:49.960" style="s2">part of the landscape here is the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.570" end="00:07:52.090" style="s2">Peter has designed it so we have maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.960" end="00:07:54.790" style="s2">who&#39;s a clown and she does these really</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.090" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">cool psycho technologies and Raven we</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.790" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">have all of these different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:03.580" style="s2">aspects to the landscape that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:05.710" style="s2">hold the diversity rather than some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.580" end="00:08:08.520" style="s2">these other sense-making spaces</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.710" end="00:08:11.560" style="s2">you see they start with this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.520" end="00:08:16.660" style="s2">let&#39;s have conversations and they tend</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.560" end="00:08:18.730" style="s2">to converge into a mean really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.660" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">the IDW did that really quickly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.730" end="00:08:23.950" style="s2">all they did was like five people</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:30.370" style="s2">interviewed each other right so so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.950" end="00:08:35.790" style="s2">think that know there&#39;s there&#39;s could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.370" end="00:08:39.220" style="s2">reasons why people intend to converge</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.790" end="00:08:42.430" style="s2">into a conversation so people like for</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.220" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">example Jordan Hall and John John drove</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">a key I talking a lot about the religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:50.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion and they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:58.260" style="s2">of like their new series of Sevilla miz</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.440" end="00:09:00.970" style="s2">kind of moving toward a vision but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.260" end="00:09:07.060" style="s2">think so there&#39;s I think the sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.970" end="00:09:08.380" style="s2">making space is being populated by by</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.060" end="00:09:10.450" style="s2">shows</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.380" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">that are trying to fight the inertia of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.450" end="00:09:22.780" style="s2">becoming becoming a certain kind of meme</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:25.570" style="s2">I see over time for example rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.780" end="00:09:28.420" style="s2">I mean that they do a very professional</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.570" end="00:09:30.670" style="s2">production but you&#39;re starting to smell</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.420" end="00:09:32.530" style="s2">a narrative art it&#39;s almost like they</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.670" end="00:09:36.460" style="s2">see a narrative art that they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.530" end="00:09:40.990" style="s2">going toward and they produce their</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.460" end="00:09:42.790" style="s2">videos very well it&#39;s it&#39;s kernel ism I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.990" end="00:09:46.150" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like investigative journalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.790" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">so there is a narrative arc so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.150" end="00:09:53.230" style="s2">sense in which yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:56.830" style="s2">there&#39;s emergence and you have a new a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.230" end="00:10:03.490" style="s2">new kind of sense making platform and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.830" end="00:10:08.080" style="s2">then so far it seems like they pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.490" end="00:10:11.050" style="s2">much converge on a meme meme Plex which</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.080" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">is not a bad thing it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.050" end="00:10:18.400" style="s2">an it&#39;s different than for example if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">or maybe or Raven did our own thing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.400" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">would probably also have this more sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:32.290" style="s2">of convergence so how can we get out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:34.890" style="s2">our own way yeah and you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.290" end="00:10:37.020" style="s2">other thing is once you have these</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.890" end="00:10:40.210" style="s2">convergences then you start to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.020" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">discontinuous conversations people start</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.210" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">to stereotype in a sense that the way I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.400" style="s2">just did that this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:50.350" style="s2">conversation you have over here and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.400" end="00:10:51.880" style="s2">is the kind of conversation you are over</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.350" end="00:10:53.380" style="s2">here and this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.880" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">conversation you have over there and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.380" end="00:10:58.770" style="s2">then you get the dynamics of social</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.510" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">sanctioning what you can or cannot say</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.770" end="00:11:03.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting time to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:05.230" style="s2">space because all those dynamics are</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.280" end="00:11:09.480" style="s2">happening I think you all know right you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.230" end="00:11:12.190" style="s2">all can tell that there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.480" end="00:11:17.310" style="s2">in the lived experience of people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.190" end="00:11:17.310" style="s2">are who are setting this stuff up</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.040" end="00:11:38.610" style="s2">was that helpful is there a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:46.470" style="s2">question to that preamble I also want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.610" end="00:11:53.829" style="s2">mom thinking mentioned that lately I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.470" end="00:11:56.860" style="s2">also been trying to expand what what</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.829" end="00:11:59.079" style="s2">shows i watch you know I talked last</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.860" end="00:12:02.680" style="s2">time I watch mark Blythe he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.079" end="00:12:06.100" style="s2">economist I&#39;ve been watching a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.680" end="00:12:10.209" style="s2">bloggers heads TV I had a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.100" end="00:12:12.820" style="s2">and then recently we started to revisit</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.209" end="00:12:16.570" style="s2">it these are really interesting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.820" end="00:12:18.190" style="s2">a lot more there&#39;s a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.570" end="00:12:20.019" style="s2">different kinds of stuff that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.190" end="00:12:22.990" style="s2">happening in other sense making spaces</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.019" end="00:12:28.110" style="s2">they don&#39;t call it sense making so just</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.990" end="00:12:32.470" style="s2">trying to stay broadly informed around</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.110" end="00:12:39.550" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas about what&#39;s going on is</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.470" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">I think very helpful yeah okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.550" end="00:12:54.910" style="s2">talk about Peter did you want to respond</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:56.380" style="s2">to that oh okay yeah Tanya said I feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.910" end="00:13:00.930" style="s2">curious what Peters potential response</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.380" end="00:13:00.930" style="s2">to what you just said and I wrote IDs X</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.220" end="00:13:16.600" style="s2">okay call yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:25.300" style="s2">totems totems are the early totemic</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.600" end="00:13:29.079" style="s2">cultures clans small bands they they the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.300" end="00:13:30.220" style="s2">totem there are Animists societies and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.079" end="00:13:32.140" style="s2">so with this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.220" end="00:13:35.820" style="s2">tie into what&#39;s D animated they were</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.140" end="00:13:40.330" style="s2">Animists and we think about Animists as</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.820" end="00:13:43.540" style="s2">giving personhood to for example some</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.330" end="00:13:45.580" style="s2">some plants and animals and trees and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.540" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">rivers and forests but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.580" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">interesting about the animists clans is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:55.330" style="s2">that only some people were considered</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.200" end="00:13:57.340" style="s2">human and only some plants were</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.330" end="00:14:02.050" style="s2">considered sacred and some animals and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.340" end="00:14:04.900" style="s2">not others and it all has to do with who</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.050" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2">could eat and who gets to be eaten right</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.900" end="00:14:11.200" style="s2">so the four if you are a forest person</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.980" end="00:14:14.740" style="s2">you didn&#39;t really see the river people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.200" end="00:14:17.650" style="s2">as humans we didn&#39;t categorize that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.740" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">way we categorize life-forms now is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.650" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">kind of evolutionary kind of species</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:29.200" style="s2">dominance hierarchy right so insects are</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:32.590" style="s2">de Baca plants insects birds I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.200" end="00:14:34.540" style="s2">know why birds are there or reptiles</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.590" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">birds you don&#39;t we order we ordered</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.540" end="00:14:39.940" style="s2">these these these families and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:43.210" style="s2">humans at the top and early man did not</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.940" end="00:14:47.800" style="s2">order that way this is actually they</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.210" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">ordered based on what was vital to their</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.800" end="00:14:53.290" style="s2">their their habitat and their culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:55.480" style="s2">right so some plants could be in other</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.290" end="00:14:57.160" style="s2">plants were sacred and so you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:15:00.520" style="s2">you would just maybe use some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.160" end="00:15:03.370" style="s2">leaves and continually to replant them</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.520" end="00:15:08.140" style="s2">some humans could be eaten and others</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.370" end="00:15:10.690" style="s2">could not be some landscapes were sacred</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.140" end="00:15:15.700" style="s2">some others were not so the collection</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.690" end="00:15:19.690" style="s2">of humans animals plants and landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.700" end="00:15:21.640" style="s2">that were sacred war was the totem and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.690" end="00:15:24.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where you have totem poles right</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.640" end="00:15:28.060" style="s2">you have the bird was sacred and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.640" end="00:15:31.090" style="s2">these parts some indigenous Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.060" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">tribes and other tribes landscapes could</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.090" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">be sacred to features in the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:39.670" style="s2">so that was the unit of coherence not</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:43.090" style="s2">the people as the unit of coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.670" end="00:15:44.380" style="s2">in an environment right the unit of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.090" end="00:15:49.090" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.380" end="00:15:50.920" style="s2">had these other entities in it what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.090" end="00:15:53.740" style="s2">would call other categories because of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.920" end="00:15:58.690" style="s2">the way they categorized it and so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.740" end="00:16:01.300" style="s2">me this notion of tribal mimetics which</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.690" end="00:16:05.140" style="s2">got very popular about you know eight or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.300" end="00:16:09.450" style="s2">ten years ago seemed silly to me so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.140" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">was like the truth at tribal type</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.450" end="00:16:13.540" style="s2">behaviors happened when the totems</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.010" end="00:16:16.420" style="s2">themselves were destroyed when the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.540" end="00:16:18.580" style="s2">landscape was destroyed and these inter</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.420" end="00:16:25.510" style="s2">being with nature and other aspects and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.580" end="00:16:28.270" style="s2">so so I like to go back to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.510" end="00:16:31.240" style="s2">totem so what not only who are your</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.270" end="00:16:33.190" style="s2">people but what is what is their sacred</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.240" end="00:16:35.800" style="s2">place and it could be this digital</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.190" end="00:16:39.580" style="s2">platform it&#39;s a sacred place to Peter</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.800" end="00:16:42.280" style="s2">and what are the what are the aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.580" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">the world that you rely on these are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.280" end="00:16:50.200" style="s2">part of supporting this and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:57.730" style="s2">is when you extend it to the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.200" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">not you also stop you also provide more</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.730" end="00:17:03.220" style="s2">space as I think this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:06.370" style="s2">reasons why their stores like this for</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.220" end="00:17:08.260" style="s2">diverse opinion so like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.370" end="00:17:11.290" style="s2">community house people started having</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.260" end="00:17:13.990" style="s2">like community houses and co-working</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.290" end="00:17:16.750" style="s2">spaces right so the actual physical</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.990" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">location is part of the totem and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.750" end="00:17:20.230" style="s2">this allows many different type of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:23.860" style="s2">people to come and go</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.230" end="00:17:28.540" style="s2">versus bounding the thing by a mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.860" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">space and so acknowledging the habitat</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.540" end="00:17:35.050" style="s2">or the habitus or the built environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:39.130" style="s2">in which you hold these explorations and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.050" end="00:17:42.760" style="s2">discovery is part of the move from tribe</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.130" end="00:17:46.540" style="s2">to totem did I answer that and that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.760" end="00:17:48.190" style="s2">that yeah so I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.540" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">little shift and I think it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.190" end="00:17:57.700" style="s2">cool way to remind ourselves are these</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:18:00.970" style="s2">things yeah so one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:03.809" style="s2">interesting titus in 2d animation is</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:08.200" style="s2">that when you see we started</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.809" end="00:18:10.710" style="s2">categorizing we stopped categorizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.200" end="00:18:14.799" style="s2">that way and we started categorizing as</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:19.630" style="s2">primarily humans animals and then we get</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.799" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">to plants which in our modern world we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.630" end="00:18:24.159" style="s2">start 2d anime even though they move and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.940" end="00:18:26.710" style="s2">they grow and they communicate but</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.159" end="00:18:28.929" style="s2">certainly objects in landscapes we&#39;ve D</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.710" end="00:18:32.529" style="s2">animated which means we don&#39;t see them</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.929" end="00:18:36.760" style="s2">as agents action intentional agents in</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.529" end="00:18:39.429" style="s2">the world we see them as we are agents</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.760" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">and we can operate on them but they</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.429" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">don&#39;t operate on us okay so we the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:52.360" style="s2">our mental model works is we D animate</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">part of the system and this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.360" end="00:19:01.480" style="s2">interesting I started to really think</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:05.110" style="s2">about this I had two experiences one was</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.480" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">I was watching planet Earth that was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.110" end="00:19:10.360" style="s2">DVD series so what quite a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:12.370" style="s2">when we used to buy DVDs and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.360" end="00:19:15.639" style="s2">it&#39;s Morgan Freeman is you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.370" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">narrating it and it&#39;s the episode where</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.639" end="00:19:22.750" style="s2">the water is coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:24.669" style="s2">Serengeti and he&#39;s talking about all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.750" end="00:19:25.659" style="s2">herds of the animals that are moving</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.669" end="00:19:28.029" style="s2">toward the water</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.659" end="00:19:31.570" style="s2">you know the elephants and the giraffes</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.029" end="00:19:34.750" style="s2">and the antelopes and something switched</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.570" end="00:19:36.789" style="s2">for me and I saw the water not the peat</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.750" end="00:19:39.130" style="s2">not the animals moving toward the water</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.789" end="00:19:43.090" style="s2">but the water moving the animals had</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.130" end="00:19:45.909" style="s2">such power right such vitality that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.090" end="00:19:51.399" style="s2">moved huge numbers millions of animals</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.909" end="00:19:53.889" style="s2">every year and then one time I was going</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.399" end="00:19:55.419" style="s2">where I used to have my horses it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.889" end="00:19:57.909" style="s2">one of those days and it&#39;s coming down</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.419" end="00:20:00.549" style="s2">the hill where you know the Sun makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.909" end="00:20:02.350" style="s2">these like bridges to heaven kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.549" end="00:20:05.230" style="s2">looked it was very very spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.350" end="00:20:07.750" style="s2">morning early misty morning and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.230" end="00:20:11.470" style="s2">Garces were eating grass and for some</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.750" end="00:20:13.690" style="s2">reason it wasn&#39;t intellectual I know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.470" end="00:20:17.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t see them eating grass I saw the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.690" end="00:20:20.830" style="s2">grass growing horses like the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.500" end="00:20:22.659" style="s2">the causal the causal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.830" end="00:20:26.200" style="s2">flipped for me and I was like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.659" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">my grass grows horses like like really</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.200" end="00:20:31.990" style="s2">you know the the the power of grass to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">grow horses and now I talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.990" end="00:20:38.679" style="s2">the power of coffee coffee moves a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:40.710" style="s2">billion people every morning and you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.679" end="00:20:43.299" style="s2">say well that&#39;s just playing with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.710" end="00:20:45.970" style="s2">language but it&#39;s not if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.299" end="00:20:48.700" style="s2">something that animates us there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.970" end="00:20:52.629" style="s2">something about the nature of coffee</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.700" end="00:20:55.269" style="s2">that is not trivial and tea and opium I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.629" end="00:20:57.879" style="s2">mean tea the tea wars in the opium wars</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.269" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">right so you start to enter this world</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.879" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">where neo animism where you start to see</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">your relationship there&#39;s always on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">agency Romney participation and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:17.980" style="s2">start to become aware of that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:20.590" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re a participant in this in</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:25.059" style="s2">this inter being all these aliveness in</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.590" end="00:21:27.820" style="s2">this this action all the time and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.059" end="00:21:31.659" style="s2">you start to have reverence in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.820" end="00:21:33.580" style="s2">because if the coffee is moving you you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.659" end="00:21:35.860" style="s2">know you could say you can sit does that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.580" end="00:21:39.460" style="s2">make me a slave to the copy well in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.860" end="00:21:41.950" style="s2">way but also it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s a gift</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.460" end="00:21:44.649" style="s2">it&#39;s a giving all the time there&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.950" end="00:21:47.379" style="s2">allow it to be animated you allow that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.649" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">experience to enter in the language of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.379" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s an actor with you so color is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:22:02.620" style="s2">same thing it&#39;s not trivial so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.820" style="s2">kind of omnidirectional participation so</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.620" end="00:22:06.039" style="s2">why does this matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.820" end="00:22:11.620" style="s2">outside of that kind of a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.039" end="00:22:13.559" style="s2">experience is that first of all when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.620" end="00:22:16.179" style="s2">first started talking about ecological</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.559" end="00:22:19.570" style="s2">management we make this mistake we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.179" end="00:22:22.299" style="s2">going to manage the ecosystem right you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.570" end="00:22:22.900" style="s2">see we D animate the ecosystem as if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.299" end="00:22:26.020" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.900" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">operate on it where it can&#39;t operate on</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.020" end="00:22:31.420" style="s2">us and of course this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:36.309" style="s2">destroyed a lot of the key ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.420" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">during the environmental revolution we</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.309" end="00:22:42.790" style="s2">make this mistake many many times in</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:47.380" style="s2">terms of thinking like in management we</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.790" end="00:22:50.800" style="s2">have management systems theory with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.380" end="00:22:54.730" style="s2">manager if he if he chooses the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.800" end="00:22:56.890" style="s2">model of the human system it can act the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.730" end="00:23:00.790" style="s2">manager can act on the human system as</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.890" end="00:23:04.270" style="s2">if it was an object right and this turns</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.790" end="00:23:06.670" style="s2">out to be really ridiculous because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.270" end="00:23:08.710" style="s2">get people are not objects and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.670" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">get deviant behavior and adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.710" end="00:23:13.090" style="s2">pushback you get all the little ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">that people are saying you you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.090" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">they&#39;re saying yes to the consultant but</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.980" style="s2">there but because you&#39;ve set it up so</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:23.980" style="s2">you&#39;re not including their there their</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.980" end="00:23:27.150" style="s2">subjectivity or their agency you get a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.980" end="00:23:30.850" style="s2">lot of adaptive adaptive pushback so</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.150" end="00:23:34.540" style="s2">it&#39;s true for coronavirus also you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.850" end="00:23:37.240" style="s2">like how can I engage with the agency of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.540" end="00:23:40.120" style="s2">the virus in a way almost like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.240" end="00:23:43.059" style="s2">mutualism going on like i understand it</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.120" end="00:23:50.230" style="s2">and then how can we live together versus</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.059" end="00:23:52.030" style="s2">oh let&#39;s act on the on the virus you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.230" end="00:23:55.570" style="s2">could see it everywhere because for</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:58.840" style="s2">example the virus the corona virus these</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.570" end="00:24:00.790" style="s2">all these viruses come from concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.840" end="00:24:09.160" style="s2">animal production right that&#39;s why they</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.790" end="00:24:12.760" style="s2">call swine flu avian flu and so again we</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.160" end="00:24:14.650" style="s2">at we we work with animals as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.760" end="00:24:17.230" style="s2">objects and they just meat production</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.650" end="00:24:21.370" style="s2">and as if that the life in them is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.230" end="00:24:26.770" style="s2">going to have an effect on us right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.370" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">all these these ways of these are all</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.770" end="00:24:32.590" style="s2">these are mental problems with our</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:35.050" style="s2">mental models and we constantly be</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.590" end="00:24:37.240" style="s2">animate we D animate our bodies you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.050" end="00:24:40.879" style="s2">just say</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.240" end="00:24:43.460" style="s2">if I take this pill then my body will</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.879" end="00:24:45.409" style="s2">then I&#39;ll I&#39;ll get better or something</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.460" end="00:24:47.509" style="s2">you know but the body is going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.409" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">response to that pill and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.509" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">complex response it has an active phase</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:25:01.490" style="s2">of active part in that yeah and just to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:03.049" style="s2">notice what you&#39;re in you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.490" end="00:25:05.860" style="s2">you participating with and what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.049" end="00:25:08.659" style="s2">participating with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.860" end="00:25:10.399" style="s2">creates it enlivens I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.659" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">actually overwhelming there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.399" end="00:25:15.940" style="s2">it&#39;s just like too much going on right</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.940" end="00:25:23.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s so so that&#39;s one way to de</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.779" end="00:25:26.210" style="s2">animate that we can act on the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.240" end="00:25:29.509" style="s2">but the system as if it&#39;s an object</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.210" end="00:25:31.730" style="s2">that&#39;s manipulable that we are at we</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.509" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">have a privileged position from which we</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.730" end="00:25:38.779" style="s2">can act on something so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:40.429" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s that&#39;s called the</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.230" end="00:25:52.610" style="s2">McLuhan popularized it it&#39;s called dual</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.659" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">causation so the popular phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.610" end="00:26:00.700" style="s2">popular phrase we create our systems and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:03.470" style="s2">then the systems work on us you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.700" end="00:26:05.720" style="s2">this called dual causation because when</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.470" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2">you think of yourself as creating the</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.090" end="00:26:17.090" style="s2">by the system you don&#39;t have agency so</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.629" end="00:26:23.019" style="s2">there&#39;s that that move that&#39;s Dee</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.090" end="00:26:26.899" style="s2">animated a lot of these paradoxes</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.780" end="00:27:04.610" style="s2">information about the system so this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:08.330" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.610" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">this is very similar to sense making</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.330" end="00:27:12.140" style="s2">Dave Snowden sense-making I have to act</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.060" style="s2">in the system and then I get more</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.140" end="00:27:17.090" style="s2">information about the system that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.060" end="00:27:22.070" style="s2">acting in there is no outside and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.090" end="00:27:23.900" style="s2">there is no outside so but the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.070" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">still a little D animated can see I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.900" end="00:27:30.830" style="s2">getting information about it as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:33.920" style="s2">a as if it&#39;s a landscape that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.830" end="00:27:37.250" style="s2">studying right but at least this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.920" end="00:27:39.530" style="s2">more sophisticated alright so those</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.250" end="00:27:41.480" style="s2">three are on the space though third one</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.530" end="00:27:43.670" style="s2">is more sophisticated because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.480" end="00:27:45.830" style="s2">understand this problem but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">a new one that I call critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.830" end="00:27:52.910" style="s2">reflexivity this is where you realize</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:56.440" style="s2">that the mental model of inside and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.910" end="00:28:01.990" style="s2">outside the system itself is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.440" end="00:28:06.290" style="s2">right so then you move toward more of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.990" end="00:28:08.600" style="s2">this omni animism this omni</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.290" end="00:28:11.810" style="s2">participation that&#39;s there&#39;s no inside</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.600" end="00:28:16.340" style="s2">and outside you know there there the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.810" end="00:28:22.600" style="s2">question of that is or the construction</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.340" end="00:28:22.600" style="s2">the mental model of that is dropped so</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.990" end="00:28:27.080" style="s2">when you&#39;re getting to get into enacted</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.610" end="00:28:30.590" style="s2">theory and stuff like that from this</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.080" end="00:28:33.890" style="s2">position so that&#39;s kind of like my my</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.590" end="00:28:38.600" style="s2">download on the animation is there any</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.890" end="00:28:41.000" style="s2">questions did that that make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.600" end="00:28:42.680" style="s2">you and the idea is what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.000" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">are the psycho technologies we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.680" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">make sense in this in the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:50.360" style="s2">would argue that the fourth okay the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:51.980" style="s2">third all right it&#39;s doing we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.360" end="00:28:55.720" style="s2">through that but the fourth one is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.980" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">really important but it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.720" end="00:29:01.100" style="s2">embody or adapt the fourth one if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:03.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have some lived experience of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.100" end="00:29:05.310" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.000" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">I&#39;m the animation or else it&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.310" end="00:29:08.340" style="s2">conceptual he can&#39;t work in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:12.360" style="s2">conceptual territory so this is why</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.340" end="00:29:14.430" style="s2">sometimes these psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.360" end="00:29:19.050" style="s2">we&#39;re inside outside drops gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.430" end="00:29:22.230" style="s2">really good hit of that kind of reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.050" end="00:29:27.570" style="s2">that you can draw right it can&#39;t be just</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.230" end="00:29:31.380" style="s2">conceptual yeah so that&#39;s where my work</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.570" end="00:29:36.060" style="s2">is I mean I spent all my time edges</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.380" end="00:29:38.390" style="s2">where nobody else is but yeah so those</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.060" end="00:29:42.210" style="s2">are those that&#39;s a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.390" end="00:29:44.730" style="s2">different ways to do systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.210" end="00:29:46.800" style="s2">right so you see people like snowed in</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.730" end="00:29:49.860" style="s2">and your baits in there on the third</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.800" end="00:29:52.440" style="s2">level there&#39;s no outside nor baits and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.860" end="00:29:56.100" style="s2">you know everything&#39;s in between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.440" end="00:29:59.580" style="s2">spaces this is already a very emergent</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.100" end="00:30:02.070" style="s2">new way of looking at things but I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.580" end="00:30:06.680" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s just there&#39;s a step</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.070" end="00:30:09.680" style="s2">beyond that hopefully we&#39;re getting to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.680" end="00:30:09.680" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.870" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">it&#39;s why I have a radical critique of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:22.020" style="s2">Keegan&#39;s systems thinking level it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.350" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">comes from the vantage point of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.020" end="00:30:27.660" style="s2">privileged observer it&#39;s not where I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:29.610" style="s2">think we should be going and the younger</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.660" end="00:30:31.350" style="s2">people don&#39;t need you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.610" end="00:30:33.420" style="s2">things the problems we have with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.350" end="00:30:36.330" style="s2">think in terms of developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.420" end="00:30:39.170" style="s2">developmental stage models for education</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.330" end="00:30:41.700" style="s2">we have this sense that people need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.170" end="00:30:44.370" style="s2">get the wrong kind of system thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.700" end="00:30:47.460" style="s2">first before we can teach them the more</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.370" end="00:30:51.270" style="s2">advanced type of systems thinking this</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.460" end="00:30:54.030" style="s2">is not true for a couple of reasons one</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.270" end="00:30:57.660" style="s2">is there&#39;s something about children are</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.030" end="00:30:59.460" style="s2">thrown into the world where the advanced</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.660" end="00:31:01.410" style="s2">type of systems thinking already makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.460" end="00:31:04.560" style="s2">more sense to their lived experience and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.410" end="00:31:07.380" style="s2">secondly the real problem we have in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.560" end="00:31:09.480" style="s2">thinking as older people are thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.380" end="00:31:11.970" style="s2">these new ways is that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.480" end="00:31:14.400" style="s2">conditioned to think in the other ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.970" end="00:31:16.269" style="s2">and so we have to double dip we have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.400" end="00:31:19.080" style="s2">deconstruct their own habits</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.269" end="00:31:21.879" style="s2">in order to move into the new habits so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.080" end="00:31:24.099" style="s2">I was having this conversation just</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.879" end="00:31:25.599" style="s2">yesterday we&#39;re building a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.099" end="00:31:28.570" style="s2">curriculum for the Montessori high</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.599" end="00:31:30.639" style="s2">school in Washington DC and they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.570" end="00:31:36.339" style="s2">to use the term systems thinking I&#39;m one</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.639" end="00:31:38.919" style="s2">of my little rants and I made some</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.339" end="00:31:41.379" style="s2">points but in general they said you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.919" end="00:31:44.429" style="s2">they agree there&#39;s got to be at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.379" end="00:31:47.019" style="s2">some development of systems into weaving</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.429" end="00:31:49.539" style="s2">holistically in order to take the next</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.019" end="00:31:52.299" style="s2">step but I think we&#39;re all in the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.539" end="00:31:55.809" style="s2">page but so this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.299" end="00:31:58.149" style="s2">happening in a practical way very large</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.809" end="00:32:01.959" style="s2">funded project for the Montessori School</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.149" end="00:32:06.190" style="s2">in in Washington DC so we can go for</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.959" end="00:32:08.709" style="s2">like the meta-analysis and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.190" end="00:32:10.809" style="s2">these things I&#39;m moving into the more</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.709" end="00:32:14.349" style="s2">popular consciousness really really fast</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.809" end="00:32:17.070" style="s2">so when I think of touching back on</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.349" end="00:32:20.769" style="s2">tagging back the sense making space</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.070" end="00:32:22.389" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of people who if</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.769" end="00:32:26.679" style="s2">you listen to them you can tell which</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.389" end="00:32:29.320" style="s2">one of these which one of these vantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.679" end="00:32:31.869" style="s2">points they&#39;re there they&#39;re standing in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.320" end="00:32:33.579" style="s2">when they&#39;re doing complex thinking are</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.869" end="00:32:35.859" style="s2">they standing in the vantage point of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.579" end="00:32:42.009" style="s2">the privileged observer not so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.859" end="00:32:50.859" style="s2">anymore but maybe maybe a little or are</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.009" end="00:32:51.849" style="s2">they they using something else so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.859" end="00:33:00.099" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.849" end="00:33:02.200" style="s2">so that was already a lot so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.099" end="00:33:03.909" style="s2">that makes some sense is it anybody have</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.200" end="00:33:07.899" style="s2">a question and then I can tie it into</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.909" end="00:33:10.989" style="s2">mapping tracking and hacking yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.899" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">thank you I&#39;ve been thinking about the D</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.989" end="00:33:15.459" style="s2">animation animation</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:18.609" style="s2">I guess I&#39;m flowing in all week and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.459" end="00:33:21.129" style="s2">thinking about it in terms of the way we</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.609" end="00:33:24.239" style="s2">have conversations and what&#39;s allowed</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.129" end="00:33:28.509" style="s2">and what&#39;s not allowed in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.239" end="00:33:29.659" style="s2">often times when I am in conversations</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.509" end="00:33:33.619" style="s2">and I can realize</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.659" end="00:33:35.690" style="s2">I get imagery and when that when I say</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.619" end="00:33:37.220" style="s2">oh I have this image of like roots</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.690" end="00:33:38.539" style="s2">interlocking and they&#39;re rubbing on each</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.220" end="00:33:40.820" style="s2">other in a way that splinters or</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.539" end="00:33:42.139" style="s2">something was the last one that happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.820" end="00:33:45.139" style="s2">in conversation it can be really</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.139" end="00:33:46.970" style="s2">generative and it often loops back</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.139" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">around in the conversation in really</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.970" end="00:33:54.049" style="s2">interesting ways and I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">it in yeah and just like what comes up</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.049" end="00:33:59.749" style="s2">how and who is welcome to speak is</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:01.489" style="s2">another aspect of it because oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.749" end="00:34:04.070" style="s2">the people who are functioning and these</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.489" end="00:34:07.549" style="s2">other levels are not they don&#39;t finish</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.070" end="00:34:11.260" style="s2">the logical systematic you know part</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.549" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">thing that&#39;s so prevalent right now so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.260" end="00:34:18.770" style="s2">throw that in yeah so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:21.020" style="s2">that was evident in my collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.770" end="00:34:24.169" style="s2">insight practice experiments you know a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.020" end="00:34:26.119" style="s2">long time ago in the 40s they had this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.169" end="00:34:28.190" style="s2">these two guys they were working for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.119" end="00:34:31.700" style="s2">product company appliances like</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.190" end="00:34:33.669" style="s2">thermoses and stuff like that and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.700" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">created this thing called Center</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.669" end="00:34:39.649" style="s2">synaptics I think and it&#39;s not worth</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.460" end="00:34:41.240" style="s2">reading the book it&#39;s so forties ish but</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.649" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">what they would do is they would have</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.240" end="00:34:47.990" style="s2">the designers go on a date like into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.819" style="s2">woods in the cabin and they&#39;d lock them</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.990" end="00:34:51.500" style="s2">in retreat for a few days you know this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.819" end="00:34:55.429" style="s2">was back when people wore ties and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.500" end="00:34:57.319" style="s2">everything to to to work you know so</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.429" end="00:34:59.569" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about the 40s early 50s and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.319" end="00:35:01.579" style="s2">they would go out to these cabins and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.569" end="00:35:07.130" style="s2">they would brainstorm product</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.579" end="00:35:10.309" style="s2">innovations and so the and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.130" end="00:35:12.799" style="s2">all like off off campus that got to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.309" end="00:35:17.569" style="s2">thought as like crazy kind of cultish</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.799" end="00:35:20.119" style="s2">artist is that product designers but as</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.569" end="00:35:21.859" style="s2">it grew you know they couldn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.119" end="00:35:23.450" style="s2">actually pull this off together so they</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.859" end="00:35:24.799" style="s2">had this certainly had some secretaries</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.450" end="00:35:30.140" style="s2">come so that they could bring the food</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.799" end="00:35:32.450" style="s2">and that&#39;s why they invited them but in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.140" end="00:35:36.049" style="s2">between the secretaries would saunter</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.450" end="00:35:39.470" style="s2">into like the retreat and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.049" end="00:35:43.130" style="s2">real sexist reality when he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.470" end="00:35:48.380" style="s2">book but and they would be listening to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.130" end="00:35:50.750" style="s2">the men talking about you know washers</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.380" end="00:35:52.670" style="s2">and stuff inside the thermos they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.750" end="00:35:54.980" style="s2">trying to invent a new thermos and all</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.670" end="00:35:56.360" style="s2">this stuff and a woman and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.980" end="00:35:58.190" style="s2">secretaries was because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.360" end="00:35:59.600" style="s2">transcript book you see the transcripts</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.190" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">and one of the secretaries was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.600" end="00:36:03.320" style="s2">listening you know she wasn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:06.170" style="s2">really participate but then she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.320" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">tells this crazy story like it&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.170" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">washing machine and when it goes like</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:12.130" style="s2">this I always feel like he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:15.830" style="s2">stretch I mean it was really this really</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.130" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">fantastic imaginative kind of embodied</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.830" end="00:36:20.750" style="s2">imagery she was happening that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:24.620" style="s2">like that guys were like oh my god you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.750" end="00:36:26.150" style="s2">know but then someone would wait that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.620" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">reminds me of something and so they</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.150" end="00:36:32.030" style="s2">started to realize that having these</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:34.660" style="s2">imagistic non-concept what I call them</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.030" end="00:36:38.180" style="s2">as I call it</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.660" end="00:36:40.730" style="s2">sophisticated naive participants right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.180" end="00:36:42.410" style="s2">so because you don&#39;t know the field and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.730" end="00:36:44.540" style="s2">you&#39;re not using your mind and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.410" end="00:36:47.770" style="s2">drawing on these like images or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.540" end="00:36:52.220" style="s2">bodily felt sense they become very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.770" end="00:36:55.580" style="s2">generative in these spaces for for</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.220" end="00:37:00.380" style="s2">collective insight and so you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.580" end="00:37:01.970" style="s2">collective insight practice workshop</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.380" end="00:37:05.570" style="s2">that we did it last month or the month</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.970" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">before the second the second skill we</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.570" end="00:37:10.430" style="s2">learned is working with provocative</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:13.640" style="s2">objects like letting the image come into</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.430" end="00:37:16.490" style="s2">your you know why why is this image of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.640" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2">roots why is why did I look at the root</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.490" end="00:37:21.770" style="s2">you know what what is what is just that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.910" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">these are not trivial these are not</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.770" end="00:37:29.300" style="s2">trivial ways to cognize complex problems</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:33.260" style="s2">they&#39;re actually quite sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.300" end="00:37:35.960" style="s2">necessary and in collective space the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.260" end="00:37:37.790" style="s2">luxury is that you don&#39;t have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.960" end="00:37:41.060" style="s2">all yourself if you happen to be a model</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.790" end="00:37:43.790" style="s2">builder and you&#39;re mapping you can count</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.060" end="00:37:45.800" style="s2">on someone like yourself to provide that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.790" end="00:37:49.340" style="s2">other that other energy that other</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.800" end="00:37:51.710" style="s2">movement in in in the space and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.340" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">should be encouraged that should be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.710" end="00:37:56.839" style="s2">encouraged also what&#39;s discouraged are</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.720" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">negative energies like irritation</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.839" end="00:38:02.229" style="s2">very strong irritations also provide</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:09.650" style="s2">very important part in collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.229" end="00:38:11.390" style="s2">practice and it and when those energies</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.650" end="00:38:13.640" style="s2">arise a lot of times it&#39;s not what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.390" end="00:38:15.589" style="s2">person saying you don&#39;t engage with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.640" end="00:38:18.259" style="s2">lot of times with the words it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.589" end="00:38:20.469" style="s2">what it&#39;s like you try to feel into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.259" end="00:38:31.609" style="s2">energy why is this energy in our space</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.469" end="00:38:33.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not trivial right yeah it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.609" end="00:38:39.009" style="s2">do you know it&#39;s hard to do over this</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.700" end="00:38:39.009" style="s2">technology what&#39;s very conversational</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.969" end="00:38:51.829" style="s2">okay so mapping tracking and hacking</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.969" end="00:38:54.650" style="s2">these are three terms that come from</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.829" end="00:38:56.989" style="s2">David Chandler&#39;s book called until</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.650" end="00:38:59.509" style="s2">politics and the anthropic scene it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.989" end="00:39:01.489" style="s2">horrible title because you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.509" end="00:39:04.789" style="s2">necessarily pick it up it&#39;s much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.489" end="00:39:11.390" style="s2">cool cool book little he actually calls</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.789" end="00:39:13.640" style="s2">it mapping sensing and hacking but when</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.390" end="00:39:16.130" style="s2">I tell you what he means by the second</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.640" end="00:39:20.089" style="s2">term I think the word tracking is much</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.130" end="00:39:24.529" style="s2">better because sensing and sense making</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.089" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">as is so much related to embodied</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.529" end="00:39:37.069" style="s2">sensing so Chandler says that in the in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:42.109" style="s2">this complexity our environment is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.069" end="00:39:44.420" style="s2">complex that certain tools that we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.109" end="00:39:46.460" style="s2">to understand things have been broken</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.420" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">down the most important one I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.460" end="00:39:48.170" style="s2">if he starts this way I&#39;m telling the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.650" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.170" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">I got a frame it somehow so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.650" end="00:39:59.479" style="s2">they&#39;re the most important tool in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:40:03.650" style="s2">modern world is if-then causality</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.479" end="00:40:07.029" style="s2">propositional statements okay so before</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.650" end="00:40:09.220" style="s2">about 5,000 years ago mythic</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.029" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">consciousness they did not have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.220" end="00:40:19.510" style="s2">to make if-then statements they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:23.260" style="s2">have that mental modeling so around</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.510" end="00:40:25.030" style="s2">Plato and Platonists discovered if-then</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.260" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">thinking they called it the upward path</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.030" end="00:40:30.250" style="s2">because if then this and if than that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:33.250" style="s2">and it creates these huge systems well</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.250" end="00:40:35.740" style="s2">then if that than this this gives us the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.250" end="00:40:38.290" style="s2">ability at this point in history to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.740" end="00:40:40.690" style="s2">create hyper objects huge complex</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.290" end="00:40:44.619" style="s2">systems where the causality is so</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.690" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">complex we can&#39;t track it we can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.619" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">it so this is not a disputed idea in</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:59.770" style="s2">advanced intelligence or academic</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:03.609" style="s2">communities even the retired general and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.770" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">me Christie knows this and that is we</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.609" end="00:41:09.690" style="s2">are facing challenges now where we</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:12.550" style="s2">cannot address with if Ben propositions</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.690" end="00:41:14.500" style="s2">if we lack can&#39;t address some of if-then</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.550" end="00:41:17.380" style="s2">propositions then we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.500" end="00:41:20.260" style="s2">hypothesis we can&#39;t test them hence no</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.380" end="00:41:24.760" style="s2">science science as we know it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.260" end="00:41:27.910" style="s2">obsolete in these situations so we call</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.760" end="00:41:31.780" style="s2">this complexity science but the word</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.910" end="00:41:34.750" style="s2">science is like oxymoronic because of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.780" end="00:41:38.859" style="s2">what I just said right so I like to call</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.750" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">it complexity thinking from a grammar in</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.859" end="00:41:47.830" style="s2">Kazakh complex thought so I had this</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:56.410" style="s2">conversation once with us where you for</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.830" end="00:41:58.990" style="s2">all in in San Francisco and I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.410" end="00:42:01.720" style="s2">I was giving this presentation about</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.990" end="00:42:04.089" style="s2">there was a time before if-then thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.720" end="00:42:06.730" style="s2">and then there was a time with if-then</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.089" end="00:42:09.580" style="s2">thinking now there&#39;s a time where if</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.730" end="00:42:14.380" style="s2">then thinking is obsolete and he came</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.580" end="00:42:21.509" style="s2">and asked a question and he said in his</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.380" end="00:42:23.459" style="s2">way what if there is no if a no then</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.509" end="00:42:27.929" style="s2">so that&#39;s very deep we&#39;ll put that aside</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.459" end="00:42:31.049" style="s2">but that&#39;s how the story ends okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.929" end="00:42:32.909" style="s2">there&#39;s no if-then thinking inside so</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.049" end="00:42:34.949" style="s2">then how do we proceed like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.909" end="00:42:38.309" style="s2">ask questions how do we inquire how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.949" end="00:42:40.889" style="s2">we face problems or how do we design our</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.309" end="00:42:45.259" style="s2">dreams right how do we do that if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.889" end="00:42:45.259" style="s2">have to move beyond if-then thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.380" end="00:42:52.109" style="s2">Chandler says he sees three types of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.269" end="00:42:55.199" style="s2">experiments happening in in our world</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.109" end="00:42:57.479" style="s2">today driven by the Anthropocene the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.199" end="00:42:58.949" style="s2">scene we try we try we try we try</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.479" end="00:43:01.799" style="s2">science doesn&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.949" end="00:43:06.359" style="s2">so he calls the three mapping sensing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.799" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">and hacking so mapping he says is okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.359" end="00:43:13.259" style="s2">so someone who&#39;s a mapper is David</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:15.929" style="s2">Daniels Rotenberg mapping is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.259" end="00:43:19.999" style="s2">figure out all the causal linkages and</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.999" end="00:43:30.449" style="s2">so so he&#39;s a really good example of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.409" end="00:43:32.369" style="s2">and you see Shaun burgers with us all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.449" end="00:43:34.169" style="s2">the time he goes on face but he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.369" end="00:43:35.729" style="s2">who knows about this he wants to map</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.169" end="00:43:38.849" style="s2">more stuff onto that and who knows about</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.729" end="00:43:40.889" style="s2">this and he&#39;s constantly trying to map</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.849" end="00:43:42.689" style="s2">these things and Chandler says well</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.889" end="00:43:44.999" style="s2">that&#39;s cool but the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.689" end="00:43:47.969" style="s2">there&#39;s infinite causal depth</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.999" end="00:43:51.449" style="s2">you&#39;ll never it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.969" end="00:43:55.759" style="s2">project you can finish okay so but</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.449" end="00:43:55.759" style="s2">that&#39;s happening if I calls that mapping</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.880" end="00:44:01.769" style="s2">and then the second thing he calls</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.439" end="00:44:08.029" style="s2">sensing but I think we should call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.769" end="00:44:12.109" style="s2">tracking this is the use of AI to detect</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.029" end="00:44:14.339" style="s2">patterns that correlate with</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.109" end="00:44:16.499" style="s2">probabilities that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.339" end="00:44:19.919" style="s2">sexy it has to do with the surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.499" end="00:44:23.429" style="s2">state and tracking so for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.919" end="00:44:28.799" style="s2">there&#39;s in this in this modality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.429" end="00:44:33.509" style="s2">no causal explanation interpreted okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.799" end="00:44:35.220" style="s2">so let&#39;s say they a I notices your deep</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.509" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">pattern recognition like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.220" end="00:44:40.530" style="s2">things like Google are working on let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:46.619" style="s2">say I notices that when women are</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.530" end="00:44:51.750" style="s2">wearing fuchsia in Britain there is an</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.619" end="00:44:54.180" style="s2">uprising in the Sudan okay now no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.750" end="00:44:56.760" style="s2">saying there&#39;s a causal relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.180" end="00:44:59.580" style="s2">that but it might be this is horribly</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.760" end="00:45:04.200" style="s2">simplifying it but it might be that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.580" end="00:45:07.080" style="s2">ship that is buys the colour future</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.200" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s popular in Britain is also</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.080" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">smuggling the drugs or something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:11.700" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:14.190" style="s2">but the ideas we don&#39;t care with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.700" end="00:45:17.130" style="s2">causal connection it&#39;s just that these</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.190" end="00:45:19.980" style="s2">things seem to be correlated at some</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.130" end="00:45:23.609" style="s2">times and not at others an AI can track</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.980" end="00:45:26.430" style="s2">these what so so this is how they you</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.609" end="00:45:29.880" style="s2">know all that work on where&#39;s terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.430" end="00:45:32.730" style="s2">cells you know is is this terrorism cell</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.880" end="00:45:37.050" style="s2">gonna ignite something this is a eye</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.730" end="00:45:39.750" style="s2">tracking patterns patterns of you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.050" end="00:45:40.740" style="s2">they&#39;re not really listening very not</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.750" end="00:45:44.760" style="s2">really listening to conversations</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.740" end="00:45:47.099" style="s2">they&#39;re watching patterns of connections</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.099" end="00:45:52.349" style="s2">patterns so he calls it sensing I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.170" end="00:45:53.730" style="s2">you agree it&#39;s better called shocking so</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.349" end="00:45:56.700" style="s2">they&#39;re not really looking for causality</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.730" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for in significant</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.700" end="00:46:03.750" style="s2">correlations alright and that&#39;s an AI</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.190" end="00:46:05.790" style="s2">driven thing all these moves by the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.750" end="00:46:09.510" style="s2">that you see in the internet of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.790" end="00:46:13.170" style="s2">space lend themselves to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.510" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">of this modality of human human</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.170" end="00:46:22.920" style="s2">reasoning because you know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:29.550" style="s2">that they have multiple consequences so</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.920" end="00:46:32.130" style="s2">having a self-driving vehicle can save</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.550" end="00:46:35.700" style="s2">on greenhouse greenhouse emissions</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.130" end="00:46:38.849" style="s2">it can also centralize the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.700" end="00:46:41.849" style="s2">and make a few people richer but it also</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.849" end="00:46:46.619" style="s2">creates more surveillance because each</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.849" end="00:46:48.630" style="s2">one of those trucks is is a node in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.619" end="00:46:49.080" style="s2">surveillance network right so all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.630" end="00:46:52.080" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.080" end="00:46:55.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a very large movement of the human</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.080" end="00:46:58.620" style="s2">species this is the predominant energy</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.050" end="00:47:02.520" style="s2">right now is this tracking tracking</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.620" end="00:47:09.780" style="s2">modality so the third one is called</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.520" end="00:47:11.940" style="s2">hacking and hacking is try is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.780" end="00:47:15.740" style="s2">been doing here trying to use embodied</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.940" end="00:47:18.620" style="s2">sensing to hack through some of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.740" end="00:47:22.500" style="s2">limiting constraints or limiting</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.620" end="00:47:27.380" style="s2">perceptions or mental models I consider</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.500" end="00:47:30.390" style="s2">Jordan Hall source code hacking my work</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.380" end="00:47:33.120" style="s2">deep cuts deep called my source code</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.390" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">these are hacking modalities like how</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.120" end="00:47:39.450" style="s2">can we just hack the entire human</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:42.600" style="s2">project and like get down to simple</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.450" end="00:47:48.120" style="s2">powerful protocols right so we know</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.600" end="00:47:49.950" style="s2">about use our body to take action</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.120" end="00:47:54.270" style="s2">reduces the complexity in this space</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.950" end="00:47:58.890" style="s2">hack our mental models so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.270" end="00:48:01.170" style="s2">third modality that he identifies which</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.890" end="00:48:02.940" style="s2">i think is the smallest that has the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.170" end="00:48:06.090" style="s2">least amount of activity around it</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.940" end="00:48:08.900" style="s2">actually maybe not for us this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.090" end="00:48:12.140" style="s2">of what most of us are involved in but</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.900" end="00:48:15.030" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a lot of traction so</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.140" end="00:48:16.890" style="s2">people who&#39;s looking at what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.030" end="00:48:19.560" style="s2">community different types of government</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.890" end="00:48:22.290" style="s2">different types of economies what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.560" end="00:48:24.120" style="s2">money all this meta inquiry around what</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.290" end="00:48:27.990" style="s2">is money well what is governance is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.120" end="00:48:32.010" style="s2">trying to get underneath it so you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.990" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">hack it and disrupt it and move to like</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.010" end="00:48:39.390" style="s2">orthogonal direction so these are three</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:42.870" style="s2">modes that are he argues and I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.390" end="00:48:46.200" style="s2">agree are changing the human mind right</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.870" end="00:48:48.570" style="s2">there the complexity of a mythic world</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.200" end="00:48:52.050" style="s2">changed the human mind and what emerged</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.570" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">was if-then causality and now we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.050" end="00:48:57.650" style="s2">point where that doesn&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:49:01.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really important critique</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.650" end="00:49:02.670" style="s2">for example both the notion of D</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.590" end="00:49:04.380" style="s2">animation</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.670" end="00:49:07.290" style="s2">if they&#39;re causalities that powerful</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.380" end="00:49:10.080" style="s2">critique about the carbon solutions the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.290" end="00:49:13.800" style="s2">climate if we take if we pick carbon out</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:34.950" style="s2">adequate to that conversation at all</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.580" end="00:49:37.290" style="s2">this is why for example I get criticized</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.950" end="00:49:40.170" style="s2">for not taking a stronger stand on</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.290" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">climate Tsongas stand on policies that</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.660" end="00:50:25.560" style="s2">contribution is to point beyond that so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:27.420" style="s2">that explains that and you can apply</p>

<p begin="00:52:16.490" end="00:52:31.170" style="s2">keeps my blood flowing gets me up in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.790" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">morning thanks for the question yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.170" end="00:52:39.810" style="s2">do we proceed sensing and acting seems</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:42.390" style="s2">hard to understand well all these</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.810" end="00:52:49.170" style="s2">methodologies are helping in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.390" end="00:52:51.090" style="s2">direction so so we started off many</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.170" end="00:52:53.730" style="s2">sessions ago talking about the incessant</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.090" end="00:52:57.690" style="s2">talking in your own head right the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.730" end="00:52:59.790" style="s2">incessant conversation Yann head well if</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.690" end="00:53:03.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t eliminate that it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.790" end="00:53:04.980" style="s2">you to sense and perceive and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.240" end="00:53:07.230" style="s2">really hard for you to see ah</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.980" end="00:53:08.369" style="s2">there&#39;s possibility opening up</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.230" end="00:53:12.150" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.369" end="00:53:14.850" style="s2">I just got to move into it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.150" end="00:53:16.980" style="s2">there&#39;s and that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying why</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.850" end="00:53:19.830" style="s2">there&#39;s hope because there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.980" end="00:53:21.330" style="s2">why all these modalities are in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.830" end="00:53:21.900" style="s2">human system and gaining a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.330" end="00:53:23.730" style="s2">traction</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.900" end="00:53:27.869" style="s2">they&#39;re all kind of a leading toward</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.730" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">this this or beyond even what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.869" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.829" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s many steps in getting there</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.779" end="00:53:38.760" style="s2">there&#39;s many all the things you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem that like if I was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.760" end="00:53:44.700" style="s2">life culture I&#39;m like oh what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:46.470" style="s2">plan and I&#39;ll be like what why are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.700" end="00:53:48.150" style="s2">doing all that you know like doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.470" end="00:53:50.279" style="s2">sound like a plan well actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.150" end="00:53:52.500" style="s2">actually a great place to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.279" end="00:53:55.829" style="s2">kind of environment but there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.500" end="00:53:57.270" style="s2">you&#39;re just yeah and look at the Stowe</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.829" end="00:54:00.150" style="s2">is I think that&#39;s what the Stowe is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.270" end="00:54:02.670" style="s2">trying to offer you know why is that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.150" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">know you might be meditating and it with</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.670" end="00:54:06.140" style="s2">a bunch of Buddhists and you&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:08.730" style="s2">don&#39;t really believe that but why you</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.140" end="00:54:10.619" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of people I know they</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.730" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">love the idea of going to the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.619" end="00:54:14.490" style="s2">academy and they see there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:17.250" style="s2">there that&#39;s essential in this space and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.490" end="00:54:19.740" style="s2">then I got to be a monk or Buddhist but</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.250" end="00:54:21.390" style="s2">you see the things were looking at it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.740" end="00:54:27.450" style="s2">kind of like when you&#39;re starving for</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.390" end="00:54:30.059" style="s2">something or like you have a scent for</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.450" end="00:54:32.549" style="s2">this is this is this is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.059" end="00:54:35.730" style="s2">hungry for it so you just move in these</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.549" end="00:54:37.440" style="s2">directions even if like conceptually you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.730" end="00:54:39.510" style="s2">have a critique of it already like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.440" end="00:54:41.910" style="s2">not gonna make you you know doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.510" end="00:54:43.950" style="s2">any sense rationally but you can&#39;t turn</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.910" end="00:54:46.109" style="s2">away or it still has your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.950" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">those are good things to follow like why</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.109" end="00:54:52.410" style="s2">are you here listening to me thing these</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">crazy things never coming to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.410" end="00:54:58.319" style="s2">conclusion well this is all part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:55:00.740" style="s2">what&#39;s operating in human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.319" end="00:55:00.740" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.749" end="00:55:18.690" style="s2">so next week I would like to this have</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.999" end="00:55:21.799" style="s2">been awesome</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.690" end="00:55:27.449" style="s2">and I really appreciate the break and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.799" end="00:55:31.559" style="s2">getting caught up on questions next week</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.449" end="00:55:33.839" style="s2">I would like to talk about what I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.559" end="00:55:36.089" style="s2">is the spirituality we need I like to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.839" end="00:55:38.369" style="s2">enter this conversation around the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.089" end="00:55:41.630" style="s2">religion that isn&#39;t a religion and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.369" end="00:55:48.599" style="s2">like that and maybe try to get some</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.630" end="00:55:50.729" style="s2">parameters around trying to hack right</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.599" end="00:55:55.829" style="s2">so the way I do is hacking trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.729" end="00:55:58.890" style="s2">down to some brass tacks of what I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.829" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">is the spirituality we need what are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.890" end="00:56:03.719" style="s2">what are the parameters of an effective</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:06.660" style="s2">spirituality and of course a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.719" end="00:56:11.369" style="s2">we said we want we would like that or I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.660" end="00:56:14.609" style="s2">would like that in in this in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.369" end="00:56:17.819" style="s2">spirituality too but maybe we can derive</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.609" end="00:56:18.630" style="s2">some some commitments that make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.819" end="00:56:22.609" style="s2">all of us</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.630" end="00:56:25.049" style="s2">or at least give us a snapshot we say no</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.609" end="00:56:26.759" style="s2">we can see the fault lines like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.049" end="00:56:28.170" style="s2">going to outline some commitments and</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.759" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll see oh that&#39;s why we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.170" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">match because my company is here and</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:35.729" style="s2">yours is over there a little and then we</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:41.279" style="s2">can kind of dissect some of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.729" end="00:56:47.369" style="s2">conversation and helpful ways that would</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.279" end="00:56:50.039" style="s2">be a half hacking modality one thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.369" end="00:56:53.339" style="s2">interested beneath the maybe in a future</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.039" end="00:56:55.559" style="s2">session is getting your thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.339" end="00:56:58.279" style="s2">wisdom Jim that is forming here at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.559" end="00:57:01.319" style="s2">stoah that could help us with you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.279" end="00:57:02.609" style="s2">practicing this stuff because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.319" end="00:57:06.989" style="s2">organically emerge really like and</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.609" end="00:57:08.729" style="s2">reoccurring events and I originally did</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.989" end="00:57:09.869" style="s2">the wisdom Jim that rebel wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.729" end="00:57:11.640" style="s2">their community thing because I was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.869" end="00:57:13.709" style="s2">community manager at one point then the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.640" end="00:57:15.959" style="s2">stoical came alive and I pivoted to this</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.709" end="00:57:17.160" style="s2">and all my attention was on that and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.959" end="00:57:18.690" style="s2">think something really special could</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.160" end="00:57:19.670" style="s2">happen there and like with all these</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.690" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">different modalities</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.670" end="00:57:25.549" style="s2">could come and have a regular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">space there so and really careers how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.549" end="00:57:34.670" style="s2">sort of cultivate that and get your</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:36.650" style="s2">opinion on it yeah I would say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.670" end="00:57:38.630" style="s2">spot on right now but I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.650" end="00:57:44.030" style="s2">having to add but I guess you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.630" end="00:57:47.990" style="s2">like we could talk about that I don&#39;t I</p>
