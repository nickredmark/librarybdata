hello everybody this is my version of
the digital campfire I'd like to share
with you some songs I wrote in the past
year or so
this one's called Cain and Abel and all
the songs that I'll be sharing with you
in this digital campfire are based on
the book of Genesis and I don't mean
them to be religious particularly I'm
mostly interested in the depth and of
these stories and how well they work
with the folk blues genre so here I go
Cain and Abel
