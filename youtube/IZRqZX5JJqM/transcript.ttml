<p begin="00:01:01.290" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">continue to look at Magee and Barber and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:09.030" style="s2">we saw their convergence argument that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:12.329" style="s2">at the core of wisdom is the systematic</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.329" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">what&#39;s real and this is very much like</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">is to the sage and then two other</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:24.780" style="s2">important aspects of it that wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.759" style="s2">much more with how you know then what</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.780" end="00:01:29.909" style="s2">you know which means how you come to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.759" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">know it and also how you interpret the</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">therefore in a related fashion deeply</p>

<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:41.389" style="s2">that&#39;s why wisdom can be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.509" end="00:01:45.539" style="s2">in important forms of pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.389" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">self-contradiction we then noted the</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.369" end="00:01:56.569" style="s2">and the emphasis on wisdom on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.369" end="00:02:00.810" style="s2">process rather than the products of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.569" end="00:02:05.249" style="s2">knowing and that both of those took us</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.810" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">into the work of Stanovich and because</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.249" end="00:02:10.709" style="s2">he famously argues that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:14.880" style="s2">hallmarks of rationality is valuing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:16.950" style="s2">process rather than sorry not rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.880" end="00:02:21.500" style="s2">than rather rating of the process in</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">and that took us also into the notion</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.110" end="00:02:32.850" style="s2">the discussion of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">Stanovich is a good bridge because hip</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.850" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">for him the notions of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:42.960" style="s2">ameliorating foolishness overlap very</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:45.030" style="s2">strongly and we got into this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.960" end="00:02:46.710" style="s2">and which I&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.030" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">comprehensively arguing throughout this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.710" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">course that rationality has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">the reliable and systematic overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">of self-deception and the potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:03:00.810" style="s2">affording of flourishing by some process</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">of optimization of achieving our goals</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.810" end="00:03:06.420" style="s2">with the caveat that as we try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">optimize we often change the change the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.420" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">goals that we are pursuing one reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">being that we come to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">appreciate the value of of the process</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">as opposed to just the end result of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:28.860" style="s2">process so in order to pursue that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:31.890" style="s2">to deepen our notion of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.860" end="00:03:34.709" style="s2">thereby deepen our notion of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.890" end="00:03:36.620" style="s2">of course wisdom has been associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.709" end="00:03:41.209" style="s2">with rationality from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.620" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">Socrates and Plato and Aristotle right</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.209" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">we took a look at the rationality debate</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.390" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">we saw I gave you three examples of many</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">possible examples experimental results</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:56.550" style="s2">that seem to show reliably this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">thing very reliably no replication</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.550" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">crisis on this material so very Eliab</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:04.920" style="s2">lis two things that people acquiesce</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:06.450" style="s2">they acknowledge and accept the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.920" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">authority of certain standards</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.450" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">principles of how they should reason and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:13.700" style="s2">yet they reliably fail to meet those</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:18.330" style="s2">standards</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.700" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">and so one way to when possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.330" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">interpretation of that not the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:25.640" style="s2">interpretation when possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">interpretation is that most people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.640" end="00:04:32.669" style="s2">irrational in nature as I pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">because rationality is existential man</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.669" end="00:04:39.610" style="s2">not just sort of abstract theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">concluding that people are irrational</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.610" end="00:04:45.010" style="s2">has important implications for their</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:47.560" style="s2">moral status their political status</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.010" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">their legal status even their</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.560" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">developmental status okay so this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.010" end="00:04:56.590" style="s2">what I keep meaning what I am saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:05:04.480" style="s2">rationality is deeply existential it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.590" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">not just theoretical okay we took a look</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.480" end="00:05:10.600" style="s2">at one the beginning of what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">the rationality debate and good science</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.600" end="00:05:17.410" style="s2">always has good debate in it the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:20.650" style="s2">rationality debate and the argument it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.410" end="00:05:23.200" style="s2">was made by Cohen that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.650" end="00:05:27.310" style="s2">can&#39;t be comprehensively irrational</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.200" end="00:05:30.670" style="s2">because we have to ask this very</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.310" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">pertinent question where do standards</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.670" end="00:05:35.290" style="s2">come from and the argument is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">standards have to come from us and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.290" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">do we come up with that normative theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:44.710" style="s2">we come up with that normative theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:46.470" style="s2">that acknowledges right the way we come</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.710" end="00:05:49.480" style="s2">up with our normative theory is its</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.470" end="00:05:51.700" style="s2">consonant with that we&#39;re the source of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.480" end="00:05:54.730" style="s2">our standards and this is the end this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.700" end="00:05:56.950" style="s2">is the idea that at the level of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.730" end="00:06:00.790" style="s2">competence my competence contains all</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.950" end="00:06:03.100" style="s2">the standards and that what I do in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.790" end="00:06:05.800" style="s2">order to get my normative theory is I</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.100" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">idealize awake all my performance errors</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.800" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">and this takes time it takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.260" end="00:06:14.410" style="s2">reflection right until I get at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:17.260" style="s2">underlying competence and then what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.410" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">doing when I&#39;m proposing a normative</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.260" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">theory is I&#39;m basically taking and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.690" end="00:06:25.090" style="s2">giving people this now explicate it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:27.790" style="s2">excavated account of the competence that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.090" end="00:06:30.310" style="s2">they possess and then demanding from</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.790" end="00:06:32.230" style="s2">them that they do their best to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.310" end="00:06:35.020" style="s2">the performance errors and meet that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.230" end="00:06:37.150" style="s2">confidence so we at the level of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.020" end="00:06:39.310" style="s2">competence we are fundamentally rational</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.150" end="00:06:42.790" style="s2">and all of the mistakes that people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.310" end="00:06:44.830" style="s2">making in these experiments according to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.790" end="00:06:48.780" style="s2">Cohen are just performance errors</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.830" end="00:06:48.780" style="s2">they&#39;re just performance errors</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.819" end="00:06:58.220" style="s2">okay and just like you do not think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.770" end="00:07:00.289" style="s2">lost English because of all of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.220" end="00:07:02.870" style="s2">performance errors you basically dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.289" end="00:07:04.819" style="s2">them and read through them and attribute</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.870" end="00:07:07.190" style="s2">to me the underlying competence the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.819" end="00:07:09.560" style="s2">Cohen is arguing we should read through</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.190" end="00:07:12.289" style="s2">and dismiss these experimental results</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.560" end="00:07:14.090" style="s2">and because the argument shows that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.289" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">people must have the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.090" end="00:07:19.669" style="s2">competence okay so how does stand of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:21.639" style="s2">reply to this well in many places but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.669" end="00:07:25.180" style="s2">think the best is Stanovich and west</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.639" end="00:07:27.319" style="s2">2000 and behavioral and brain sciences</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:29.539" style="s2">because the argument that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.319" end="00:07:33.259" style="s2">really for me a gold standard of how you</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.539" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">do really good cognitive science the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.259" end="00:07:37.400" style="s2">they integrate philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">psychological argumentation together for</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.400" end="00:07:47.930" style="s2">example is really really really</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:51.620" style="s2">impressive so stand of itchin West say</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.930" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">well if Cohen is right then all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.620" end="00:07:57.979" style="s2">errors that people are making our</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">performance errors and Cohen is invoking</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.979" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">the competence performance distinction</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.810" end="00:08:13.610" style="s2">know to Chomsky and and ultimately to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.569" end="00:08:15.380" style="s2">Piaget now let&#39;s remember Piaget because</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.610" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this well how do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.380" end="00:08:21.949" style="s2">know how do you distinguish the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:23.990" style="s2">right speech deficit from the drunkards</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.949" end="00:08:25.870" style="s2">right the drunker it is giving</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.990" end="00:08:29.419" style="s2">performance error but we think the child</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.870" end="00:08:32.180" style="s2">actually her competence for example is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.419" end="00:08:33.860" style="s2">not sufficiently developed why do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.180" end="00:08:35.240" style="s2">think that why do we think when the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.860" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">children are making all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.240" end="00:08:39.529" style="s2">conservation errors right that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.880" end="00:08:41.060" style="s2">reflects something about their</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.529" end="00:08:43.430" style="s2">competence at that point</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.060" end="00:08:48.290" style="s2">well that&#39;s because competence errors</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.430" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">that reflect a defect or a deficit in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.290" end="00:08:53.990" style="s2">competence are systematic errors that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:56.779" style="s2">precisely how Piaget did his work right</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.990" end="00:08:59.630" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely how you would determine</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.779" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">that if I got brain damaged and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.630" end="00:09:06.070" style="s2">leaving out like my sentences or broke</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:08.740" style="s2">that it is not performance error because</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.070" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">my errors would be systematic across</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.740" end="00:09:13.090" style="s2">different context different times of day</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">different tasks I&#39;d be making these</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.090" end="00:09:19.870" style="s2">mistakes performance errors are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:22.930" style="s2">systematic right so if I if my speech is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.870" end="00:09:24.280" style="s2">broken because I&#39;m rushing right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:26.020" style="s2">not going to be broken when I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.280" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">rushing if my speech is broken when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.020" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">tired it&#39;s not going to be broken when</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:36.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not tired so this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:38.200" style="s2">circumstantially driven right and as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.040" end="00:09:40.150" style="s2">circumstances change the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.200" end="00:09:40.540" style="s2">error will change and go all over the</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.540" end="00:09:50.170" style="s2">so these errors are not systematic in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.730" end="00:09:52.510" style="s2">nature okay well that means we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.170" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">reliable way of telling whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.510" end="00:09:57.340" style="s2">the errors that the people are making in</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:59.950" style="s2">the experiments are performance errors</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.340" end="00:10:03.480" style="s2">or not how do you see if errors are</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.950" end="00:10:06.520" style="s2">systemic well this is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.480" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">errors are systematic if when I make</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.520" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">this error it&#39;s highly predictive that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">I&#39;ll make this error it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:14.110" style="s2">predictive that I make this error it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">highly predictive that I&#39;ll make this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.110" end="00:10:17.800" style="s2">error so if a child is showing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.000" style="s2">conservation in this task that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.800" end="00:10:21.430" style="s2">predictive that they&#39;ll fail to show</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.000" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">conservation right in this task in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.430" end="00:10:27.010" style="s2">task in this task right so the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">which we&#39;ve talked about this before the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.010" end="00:10:30.400" style="s2">degree to which there&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:32.530" style="s2">manifold remember when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.400" end="00:10:34.270" style="s2">general intelligence the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.530" end="00:10:35.830" style="s2">your performance in one task is</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.270" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">predictive of how you&#39;ll do on other</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.830" end="00:10:41.860" style="s2">tasks if you have a manifold in your</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:44.290" style="s2">performance if there&#39;s if the errors are</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.860" end="00:10:46.330" style="s2">systematic across many different tasks</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.290" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re performing then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.330" end="00:10:53.230" style="s2">evidence that the errors are systemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">rather than not systematic okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.230" end="00:10:56.830" style="s2">that&#39;s easy enough so then what we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">do is we can and we&#39;ve got all this data</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.830" end="00:11:02.950" style="s2">we can look at people doing these</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:04.840" style="s2">different experiments we and many</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.950" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2">experiments that doing multiple versions</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.840" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">the same participant is doing one task</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:13.420" style="s2">rinna so what we can do is the following</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.980" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2">we can see if if I for example if I make</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.420" end="00:11:16.920" style="s2">a failure in critical detachment does</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:18.449" style="s2">that mean that all</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.920" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">I&#39;ll also tend to show belief for</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.449" end="00:11:21.899" style="s2">severance does that also mean that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:23.759" style="s2">tend to leap to the wrong conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.899" end="00:11:26.279" style="s2">when I was doing the task art you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.759" end="00:11:28.290" style="s2">the the lily pads covering the pond and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.279" end="00:11:33.869" style="s2">the answer and this is what there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:38.519" style="s2">overwhelming evidence for is yes the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.869" end="00:11:47.399" style="s2">errors you make are systematic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.519" end="00:11:52.709" style="s2">systematic and see so now Santa bitching</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.399" end="00:11:54.929" style="s2">let&#39;s say ah Cohen&#39;s argument predicts</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.709" end="00:11:56.910" style="s2">that the errors are performance errors</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.929" end="00:11:59.339" style="s2">that&#39;s what he claims that means that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.910" end="00:12:02.339" style="s2">the errors should be not systematic but</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.339" end="00:12:04.769" style="s2">what we find is overwhelming convincing</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.339" end="00:12:06.119" style="s2">evidence that the errors that people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.769" end="00:12:08.579" style="s2">making and all these tasks are</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.119" end="00:12:11.689" style="s2">systematically related together so these</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.579" end="00:12:15.299" style="s2">are errors at the level of competence</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.689" end="00:12:17.759" style="s2">and now you go right and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.299" end="00:12:20.699" style="s2">mean about good debate makes something</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.759" end="00:12:22.980" style="s2">problematic right because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.699" end="00:12:24.449" style="s2">something right about Cohen&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.980" end="00:12:26.819" style="s2">in standard which acknowledges it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.449" end="00:12:29.879" style="s2">there&#39;s something right in that we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.819" end="00:12:33.899" style="s2">to be the source right of our standards</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.879" end="00:12:38.269" style="s2">and yet caught Cohen&#39;s conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.899" end="00:12:41.910" style="s2">all the errors are performance errors is</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.269" end="00:12:46.350" style="s2">wrong it&#39;s it&#39;s undeniably wrong how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.910" end="00:12:46.980" style="s2">we put these together well you put these</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.350" end="00:12:48.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:51.119" style="s2">and you can see Stanovich and waste</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.839" end="00:12:52.589" style="s2">doing this to varying degrees you put</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.119" end="00:12:54.269" style="s2">this together by stepping back and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.589" end="00:12:55.799" style="s2">looking at an assumption that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.269" end="00:13:01.980" style="s2">Cohen&#39;s argument it&#39;s an assumption</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.799" end="00:13:04.139" style="s2">about the competence Cohen is assuming</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.980" end="00:13:09.749" style="s2">that that competence for rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.139" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">a single competence he&#39;s assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.749" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">that competence is static</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.070" end="00:13:22.029" style="s2">right he&#39;s also assuming that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.899" end="00:13:22.029" style="s2">competence is completely individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.180" end="00:13:31.010" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll come back to this one much</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.390" end="00:13:34.010" style="s2">later I&#39;m going to address these two</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.010" end="00:13:36.770" style="s2">because Stanovich really doesn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.010" end="00:13:39.399" style="s2">about this so remember that but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.770" end="00:13:39.399" style="s2">come back to it later</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.520" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">think about the Platonic idea what if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.740" end="00:13:52.610" style="s2">have two competences that both are</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:55.540" style="s2">working towards getting me to reliably</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.610" end="00:14:00.010" style="s2">achieve my goals correct my own behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.540" end="00:14:03.490" style="s2">but these competencies could actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.010" end="00:14:03.490" style="s2">conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.640" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">that would mean I would be the source of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.589" end="00:14:10.640" style="s2">all the standards here all the standards</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.020" style="s2">here here are all the standards here I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.640" end="00:14:18.140" style="s2">am all I&#39;m the source for all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.020" end="00:14:20.060" style="s2">standards but at the level of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.140" end="00:14:22.820" style="s2">competence I can be generating error</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.060" end="00:14:27.190" style="s2">because these two competencies can</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.820" end="00:14:27.190" style="s2">actually be in conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.790" end="00:14:32.150" style="s2">so one of this the one the way you start</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.620" end="00:14:34.910" style="s2">to resolve this debate and this has</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.150" end="00:14:35.990" style="s2">become a central idea in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.910" end="00:14:38.650" style="s2">cognitive psychology and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.990" end="00:14:41.890" style="s2">science is that we don&#39;t have a single</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.650" end="00:14:46.250" style="s2">competency we have to have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.890" end="00:14:50.470" style="s2">competencies and what that means is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.250" end="00:14:55.940" style="s2">this is why for example assuming and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.470" end="00:14:58.510" style="s2">critically uncritically assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.940" end="00:15:01.610" style="s2">you could reduce rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.510" end="00:15:04.570" style="s2">identify it with the single competence</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.610" end="00:15:08.180" style="s2">of syllogistic reasoning is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.570" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">fundamentally wrong it&#39;s not paying</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.180" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">attention to the science</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.780" end="00:15:21.880" style="s2">here&#39;s another issue Cohen is assuming</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.060" end="00:15:25.450" style="s2">that your competence is full-blown it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.880" end="00:15:27.070" style="s2">finished it&#39;s static it&#39;s done but and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.450" end="00:15:30.370" style="s2">sort of slipped this in notice the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.070" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">examples I used of small children their</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.370" end="00:15:35.020" style="s2">competence for example in English or</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:36.010" style="s2">whatever language they&#39;re speaking I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.020" end="00:15:37.810" style="s2">just happen to be speaking English</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.010" end="00:15:40.870" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m using it the little girl</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.210" end="00:17:54.670" style="s2">a little bit later okay second person in</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.450" end="00:23:10.330" style="s2">logical merely using probability theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:13.420" style="s2">right does that mean I can be arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.330" end="00:23:15.250" style="s2">and ignore logic no it&#39;s the much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.420" end="00:23:17.530" style="s2">difficult and notice how this starts to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.250" end="00:23:19.630" style="s2">overlap with wisdom it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.530" end="00:23:22.360" style="s2">difficult issue of knowing when where</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.630" end="00:23:27.870" style="s2">and to what degree I should use logic</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.360" end="00:23:27.870" style="s2">and probability in a formal manner etc</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.470" end="00:23:34.410" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.410" style="s2">how does stand a virtue and West reply</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.570" end="00:23:44.600" style="s2">again I think it&#39;s brilliant they say</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:51.860" style="s2">all of this is right but it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.600" end="00:23:54.680" style="s2">rationality all of this right all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.860" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">this stuff they tend to talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.680" end="00:24:00.230" style="s2">terms they use the phrase computational</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:03.350" style="s2">limitations they always describe it sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.230" end="00:24:05.000" style="s2">of negatively instead of positively</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.350" end="00:24:07.040" style="s2">instead of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.000" end="00:24:08.210" style="s2">although the two are inter defined they</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.040" end="00:24:10.040" style="s2">always talk about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.210" end="00:24:11.510" style="s2">computational limitations but they say</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.040" end="00:24:13.070" style="s2">all this stuff that chair niak is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.510" end="00:24:15.080" style="s2">talking about in terms of computational</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.070" end="00:24:17.900" style="s2">limitations is actually not about</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.080" end="00:24:23.570" style="s2">rationality it&#39;s actually about</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.900" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">intelligence now this is gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.570" end="00:24:29.270" style="s2">brilliant move and what its gonna also</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:30.710" style="s2">show us is there&#39;s a D and I said</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.270" end="00:24:32.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a while ago if there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.710" end="00:24:34.910" style="s2">difference between being intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.660" end="00:24:36.830" style="s2">being rational in fact Stanovich is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.910" end="00:24:39.770" style="s2">gonna argue that what makes you foolish</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:42.470" style="s2">is you&#39;re highly intelligent and highly</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.770" end="00:24:45.110" style="s2">irrational and that is going to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.470" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">sense right of what we&#39;ve already argued</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.110" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">that the very processes that make me</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:52.090" style="s2">adaptively intelligent are the very</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:55.090" style="s2">processes that also subject me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.090" end="00:24:55.090" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.270" end="00:25:02.300" style="s2">how does he do this well he basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.540" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">argues and you saw an analogous argue</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.300" end="00:25:05.150" style="s2">how did they do this and how does</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:11.210" style="s2">television do it elsewhere right</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.150" end="00:25:12.740" style="s2">basically argue ah right when we test</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.210" end="00:25:16.130" style="s2">for people&#39;s ability to zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.740" end="00:25:18.110" style="s2">relevant information right how what how</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.130" end="00:25:21.280" style="s2">can we test to see how well people deal</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.110" end="00:25:21.280" style="s2">with computational limitations</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:28.490" style="s2">so what Stanovich basically argues is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.460" end="00:25:30.530" style="s2">and again myself and Leo farrago of Leo</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.490" end="00:25:32.780" style="s2">Ferrara argued this in a convergent</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.530" end="00:25:34.550" style="s2">fashion other people right basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.780" end="00:25:37.040" style="s2">what we&#39;re testing when we&#39;re testing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.550" end="00:25:38.060" style="s2">people&#39;s intelligence is we&#39;re testing</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.040" end="00:25:40.460" style="s2">their capacity to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.060" end="00:25:41.810" style="s2">computational limitations and this lines</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.460" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">up again also you&#39;ve heard me mention</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.810" end="00:25:45.830" style="s2">this the measures of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:47.300" style="s2">correlate with measures of working</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.830" end="00:25:48.770" style="s2">memory and blah blah blah are giving you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.300" end="00:25:50.270" style="s2">all that argument stand of itch is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.770" end="00:25:51.770" style="s2">giving you an additional argument here</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.270" end="00:25:55.590" style="s2">he&#39;s saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.770" end="00:25:57.330" style="s2">so we understand intelligence as the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.590" end="00:25:58.950" style="s2">capacity to deal with computational</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.330" end="00:26:00.750" style="s2">limitations that&#39;s negative way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.950" end="00:26:02.670" style="s2">putting it I would say it&#39;s the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.750" end="00:26:04.830" style="s2">to do relevance realization but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.670" end="00:26:07.290" style="s2">keep going and then we have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.830" end="00:26:09.510" style="s2">therefore measuring people&#39;s capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.290" end="00:26:12.060" style="s2">deal with computational limitations so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.510" end="00:26:15.660" style="s2">chair niak is saying people fail in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.060" end="00:26:17.820" style="s2">experiment because of computational</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.660" end="00:26:19.890" style="s2">limitations there in the finitary</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.820" end="00:26:22.220" style="s2">predicament and we have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.890" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">measuring how well people can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.220" end="00:26:25.680" style="s2">computational limitations</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:29.250" style="s2">that&#39;s intelligence we have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.680" end="00:26:31.770" style="s2">measuring G reliable robust way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.250" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">measuring G so now notice what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.770" end="00:26:38.790" style="s2">again so brilliant right we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.840" end="00:26:40.860" style="s2">reliable ways of measuring G remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.790" end="00:26:44.340" style="s2">what he what stand of itch and Weston</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.860" end="00:26:47.790" style="s2">was showed with answer to Cohen that all</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.340" end="00:26:49.770" style="s2">of the reasoning tasks also form a pause</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.790" end="00:26:51.960" style="s2">strong and manifold they don&#39;t label</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.770" end="00:26:56.490" style="s2">anything but I&#39;m gonna call it R there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.960" end="00:27:00.570" style="s2">right sort of gr all right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.490" end="00:27:03.210" style="s2">general factor of reasoning because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.570" end="00:27:05.640" style="s2">reasoning tasks form a strong positive</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.210" end="00:27:09.930" style="s2">manifold okay so what we can do is we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.640" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">can measure the G of our right and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.930" end="00:27:18.570" style="s2">we can do something very very very basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:21.450" style="s2">if what&#39;s happening in the experiment is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.570" end="00:27:24.380" style="s2">a measure of rationality and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.450" end="00:27:26.610" style="s2">is equivalent to dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.380" end="00:27:30.270" style="s2">combinatorial explosion computational</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.610" end="00:27:33.330" style="s2">limitations then these two should</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.270" end="00:27:38.460" style="s2">approach parody intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.330" end="00:27:40.380" style="s2">rationality should be identical right so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.460" end="00:27:46.250" style="s2">notice what what&#39;s going on here if</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.380" end="00:27:48.620" style="s2">cherni AK is right then rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.250" end="00:27:52.050" style="s2">intelligence would be identical and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.620" end="00:27:54.300" style="s2">there would be a strong relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.050" end="00:27:58.760" style="s2">between how intelligent you are and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.300" end="00:28:03.450" style="s2">well you do on these experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.760" end="00:28:07.090" style="s2">this is again where good science</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.450" end="00:28:12.190" style="s2">reliable robust well replicated lots of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.090" end="00:28:14.530" style="s2">convert decades the relationship here is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:16.809" style="s2">at best 0.3 so you know that correlation</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.530" end="00:28:18.940" style="s2">goes from zero to one where zeros no</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.809" end="00:28:24.730" style="s2">correlation and one is very strong</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.940" end="00:28:28.330" style="s2">correlation 0.3 intelligence what this</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.730" end="00:28:31.480" style="s2">clearly shows is that intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.330" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">necessary but nowhere near sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.480" end="00:28:40.330" style="s2">for being rational so here&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:43.210" style="s2">that are insufficient for making you</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.330" end="00:28:49.780" style="s2">rational just being very intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.210" end="00:28:54.940" style="s2">just being able to use logic the science</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.780" end="00:28:58.600" style="s2">is actually clear on this so notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.940" end="00:29:00.309" style="s2">notice how a lot of the ways our culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.600" end="00:29:03.130" style="s2">has tried to understand rationality are</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.309" end="00:29:05.770" style="s2">now coming into question we right</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.130" end="00:29:07.390" style="s2">oh well rationality is equivalent think</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:09.970" style="s2">of descartes now you see my Descartes is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.390" end="00:29:12.309" style="s2">wrong of course right of logic allottee</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.970" end="00:29:14.590" style="s2">well that turns out to be false</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.309" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2">oh well rationality is the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.590" end="00:29:20.309" style="s2">being really smart really intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:26.919" style="s2">right nope that turns out to be false Oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.309" end="00:29:28.630" style="s2">what is that then what is that then so</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.919" end="00:29:31.830" style="s2">now we&#39;re starting to do good science</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.630" end="00:29:34.150" style="s2">right we&#39;re starting to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.830" end="00:29:36.250" style="s2">common sense which sudden you have some</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.150" end="00:29:43.169" style="s2">humility we&#39;re starting to it&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.250" end="00:29:46.539" style="s2">real problem well what is it what is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.169" end="00:29:47.890" style="s2">and it gives us a guy a way of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.539" end="00:29:49.419" style="s2">talking about what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.890" end="00:29:52.630" style="s2">about through the very processes that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.419" end="00:29:54.700" style="s2">make you intelligent can actually cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.630" end="00:29:56.860" style="s2">you to be irrational there is no</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.700" end="00:30:00.340" style="s2">contradiction in saying you&#39;re highly</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.860" end="00:30:02.490" style="s2">intelligent and highly irrational not at</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.340" end="00:30:02.490" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.700" end="00:30:08.890" style="s2">so now we have to ask ourselves well</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.550" end="00:30:10.870" style="s2">what&#39;s the missing piece so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.890" end="00:30:13.030" style="s2">remember that we&#39;ve got an important</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.870" end="00:30:15.340" style="s2">question that we need to ask an answer</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.030" end="00:30:18.100" style="s2">what&#39;s the missing piece for rationality</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:20.140" style="s2">what&#39;s missing something else is going</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.100" end="00:30:22.330" style="s2">on and that missing piece is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.140" end="00:30:26.520" style="s2">tell us quite a bit I think about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.330" end="00:30:26.520" style="s2">overlap between wisdom and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.580" end="00:30:34.660" style="s2">now there&#39;s a third argument and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.490" end="00:30:36.550" style="s2">important argument because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.660" end="00:30:38.800" style="s2">going to connect to the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.550" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">understanding which is again a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.800" end="00:30:45.850" style="s2">feature of wisdom now stand a fiction</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:49.020" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about this argument but they</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.020" end="00:30:53.770" style="s2">came up with the argument explicitly I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.270" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">think it&#39;s just because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.770" end="00:30:56.710" style="s2">there&#39;s any fraud I think they just</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.130" style="s2">didn&#39;t read it because the person was</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.710" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">the person I&#39;m going to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.130" end="00:31:05.010" style="s2">Medlen and the article is from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:09.010" style="s2">Scandinavian Journal of Psychology in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.010" end="00:31:13.150" style="s2">1970 so you know it&#39;s impossible to read</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.010" end="00:31:16.330" style="s2">everyone everywhere at all times again</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.150" end="00:31:17.940" style="s2">we are in the finitary predicament buts</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.330" end="00:31:20.590" style="s2">Medlin pointed out something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.940" end="00:31:22.330" style="s2">Stanovich and west do take seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.590" end="00:31:24.460" style="s2">because medellin makes an explicit and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.330" end="00:31:29.830" style="s2">clear argument for it we should pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.460" end="00:31:31.780" style="s2">attention to what he says he says well</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.830" end="00:31:34.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a difficulty with easy so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.780" end="00:31:37.180" style="s2">is the third response we&#39;ve had Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.270" end="00:31:39.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve had chair niak and now a response</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.180" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">that I will attribute to smellin</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.150" end="00:31:46.350" style="s2">Stanovich and West don&#39;t but they should</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:46.350" style="s2">but again no no crime on their part</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.620" end="00:31:51.790" style="s2">okay so Aslan says well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.750" end="00:31:53.940" style="s2">difficulty with interpreting the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.790" end="00:31:56.770" style="s2">experiments again that&#39;s the issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.940" end="00:31:59.800" style="s2">always the issue of interpretation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.770" end="00:32:02.140" style="s2">you can&#39;t do an experiment to decide the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.800" end="00:32:03.850" style="s2">interpretation because then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.140" end="00:32:06.160" style="s2">do right then you have to interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.850" end="00:32:09.100" style="s2">experiment you can&#39;t experiment your way</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.160" end="00:32:13.330" style="s2">out of interpretation interpretation is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.100" end="00:32:15.310" style="s2">always going to be needed in science and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.330" end="00:32:16.679" style="s2">that means theoretical debate is always</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.310" end="00:32:20.579" style="s2">going to be needed</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.679" end="00:32:24.969" style="s2">okay so back to the theoretical debate</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.579" end="00:32:27.969" style="s2">sense it says now interpreting these</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.969" end="00:32:33.149" style="s2">experiments relies on a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.969" end="00:32:33.149" style="s2">between a fallacy and a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.659" end="00:32:40.629" style="s2">because there&#39;s two ways in which I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.219" end="00:32:49.569" style="s2">give the wrong answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.629" end="00:32:58.419" style="s2">one is I write I interpret the problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.569" end="00:33:04.649" style="s2">correctly I understand it but then I</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.419" end="00:33:13.149" style="s2">reason incorrectly and that&#39;s why I get</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.649" end="00:33:18.009" style="s2">the wrong answer so the fault in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.149" end="00:33:19.629" style="s2">fallacy fallacious reasoning is this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.009" end="00:33:23.319" style="s2">where the error comes in the poor</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.629" end="00:33:24.609" style="s2">reasoning a reason incorrectly but</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.319" end="00:33:27.129" style="s2">there&#39;s another way in which I can give</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.609" end="00:33:27.940" style="s2">the wrong answer to get to the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.129" end="00:33:30.759" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.940" end="00:33:36.549" style="s2">with the wrong answer well what is it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.759" end="00:33:40.119" style="s2">actually reason correctly in a normative</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.549" end="00:33:42.389" style="s2">fashion but I&#39;ve understood the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.119" end="00:33:42.389" style="s2">incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.950" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">all right and that&#39;s a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.560" end="00:33:57.150" style="s2">somebody misunderstands us the error</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:59.400" style="s2">comes in because they&#39;ve interpreted the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.150" end="00:34:02.490" style="s2">problem they&#39;ve understood the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.400" end="00:34:05.220" style="s2">incorrectly but once once you give them</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.490" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">that right incorrect interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.220" end="00:34:10.140" style="s2">there there&#39;s nothing wrong with their</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">reasoning there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.140" end="00:34:18.780" style="s2">their reasoning okay okay great</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:21.270" style="s2">so there&#39;s two places we can get there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.780" end="00:34:22.590" style="s2">two equally good explanations for why we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.270" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2">produce the wrong answers</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:28.380" style="s2">one is we reason incorrectly and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:31.110" style="s2">a fallacy because we&#39;ve got correct</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.380" end="00:34:32.429" style="s2">interpretation the other one is we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.110" end="00:34:34.650" style="s2">reasoning correctly there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.429" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">wrong with our reasoning but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.650" end="00:34:39.929" style="s2">understood the problem incorrectly and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:42.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a misunderstanding right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.929" end="00:34:44.580" style="s2">that&#39;s okay so this distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.060" end="00:34:46.380" style="s2">really crucial because right this</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.580" end="00:34:48.210" style="s2">distinction is really crucial keeping</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.380" end="00:34:51.900" style="s2">these apart is really crucial because</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.210" end="00:34:54.150" style="s2">the if we want to conclude that people</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.900" end="00:34:59.960" style="s2">are irrational we have to be attributing</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.150" end="00:35:01.890" style="s2">to them fallacious cognition not pure</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.960" end="00:35:05.460" style="s2">sorry not sorry</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.890" end="00:35:06.840" style="s2">oh wow where did Pierre come wait we</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.460" end="00:35:09.690" style="s2">have to attribute to them fallacious</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.840" end="00:35:14.910" style="s2">cognition not some kind of distortion in</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.690" end="00:35:19.470" style="s2">the communication that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.910" end="00:35:25.980" style="s2">misunderstood us one of the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.470" end="00:35:28.110" style="s2">which people typically often avoid self</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.980" end="00:35:30.840" style="s2">criticism avoiding the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.110" end="00:35:33.330" style="s2">they might have reasoned correctly is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.840" end="00:35:37.650" style="s2">always claim that they have merely being</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.330" end="00:35:39.120" style="s2">misunderstood they misunderstood look</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.650" end="00:35:41.670" style="s2">for that in somebody look for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.120" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">who never says ah right my argument is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.670" end="00:35:45.620" style="s2">wrong I did it wrong look for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">who always says no no I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.620" end="00:35:53.190" style="s2">misunderstood yeah because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:54.780" style="s2">basically trading on this in an</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.190" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">equivocal fashion they&#39;re bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.780" end="00:36:00.390" style="s2">you in a way okay so no sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:02.610" style="s2">should say I&#39;ve been misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.390" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">totally sometimes but sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.610" end="00:36:07.210" style="s2">should say</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:12.600" style="s2">I reasoned wrong okay let&#39;s get back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.210" end="00:36:15.070" style="s2">this okay so far so good right</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.600" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">but then medicine said but this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.070" end="00:36:19.710" style="s2">difficult because these things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:22.390" style="s2">independent the way we need them to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.710" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">what what I mean the attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.390" end="00:36:26.140" style="s2">fallacy or the attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:27.990" style="s2">misunderstanding are not independent the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.140" end="00:36:30.910" style="s2">way we need them to be in order to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.990" end="00:36:33.640" style="s2">cleanly interpret the experimental</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.910" end="00:36:36.070" style="s2">results as showing that people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.640" end="00:36:39.130" style="s2">largely in gating engaging in fallacious</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.070" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">reasoning well why so smitherland does</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.130" end="00:36:42.490" style="s2">something and of course I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.990" end="00:36:43.120" style="s2">preliminary but we&#39;ll have to come back</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.490" end="00:36:46.390" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.120" end="00:36:51.340" style="s2">right which is give a preliminary</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.390" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">account of understanding and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.340" end="00:36:54.250" style="s2">basically says well what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:57.130" style="s2">understand something and he says well to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.250" end="00:37:01.210" style="s2">understand X we asked people to give us</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.130" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">something that&#39;s identical to acts well</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.210" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">let&#39;s use arrows here</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.450" end="00:37:17.100" style="s2">to acts we asked us to give us something</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.150" end="00:37:22.410" style="s2">that contradicts acts right we asked us</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.100" end="00:37:23.700" style="s2">to give things that X implies and these</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.410" end="00:37:25.590" style="s2">are all of course related because</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.700" end="00:37:27.030" style="s2">identity as a kind of implication</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.590" end="00:37:29.369" style="s2">contradiction as a failure of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.030" end="00:37:32.900" style="s2">implication and then we also asked them</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.369" end="00:37:35.010" style="s2">to give us things that are relevant to X</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.900" end="00:37:40.260" style="s2">now there it is again</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.010" end="00:37:41.850" style="s2">uh-huh I would also add by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.260" end="00:37:43.950" style="s2">because when you look at further</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.850" end="00:37:46.440" style="s2">research and understanding people talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.950" end="00:37:48.570" style="s2">about it not only what what is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.440" end="00:37:49.770" style="s2">to X but also what is X relevant to and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.570" end="00:37:58.770" style="s2">I don&#39;t thinks Medellin would it would</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.770" end="00:38:04.080" style="s2">object to that but here&#39;s the here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.770" end="00:38:04.590" style="s2">relevance again of course ok so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.080" end="00:38:09.030" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.590" end="00:38:10.980" style="s2">ah now put this one aside and SMED Flynn</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.030" end="00:38:15.060" style="s2">just sort of puts it aside in his</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.980" end="00:38:18.090" style="s2">argument and of course that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.060" end="00:38:21.180" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to sort of let sit by he</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.090" end="00:38:29.070" style="s2">puts aside this he says well ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.180" end="00:38:30.810" style="s2">that look at these three the way we</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.070" end="00:38:34.740" style="s2">determine if somebody has understood us</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.810" end="00:38:37.710" style="s2">is we determine we determine if they</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.740" end="00:38:39.630" style="s2">have drawn the identities we would draw</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.710" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">draw the contradictions we have drawn</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.630" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">drawn the implications we&#39;ve drawn right</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:48.680" style="s2">so somebody understands us if they</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:48.680" style="s2">reason the way that we do</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.220" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">so what&#39;s medicine says this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.840" end="00:38:58.680" style="s2">scientists are assuming the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:39:00.119" style="s2">are assuming that the participants in</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.680" end="00:39:04.080" style="s2">the experiment have understood the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.119" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">problem sorry right have understood the</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.459" end="00:40:15.690" style="s2">argument here right you can you could</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.319" end="00:40:17.940" style="s2">you can conclude that they&#39;re making the</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.940" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">have to say for some reason right at</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.819" end="00:40:23.640" style="s2">this really difficult problem of</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.259" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">they go to solve the problem their</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.019" end="00:40:35.999" style="s2">reasoning poorly or you can say right</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:37.289" style="s2">their reasoning correctly but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.999" end="00:40:40.229" style="s2">misunderstood the poem but that also</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.289" end="00:40:43.249" style="s2">means that their reasoning poorly or</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">okay so two things to note here two</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.349" end="00:41:03.569" style="s2">important things to note first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:08.660" style="s2">got to come back to this because there</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:26.790" style="s2">this right right but they do come up</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.920" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">with a very important point and this go</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.790" end="00:41:30.750" style="s2">and this is convergent with their</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.810" end="00:41:56.819" style="s2">construal means basically we need a</p>

<p begin="00:41:56.819" end="00:42:04.619" style="s2">problem and this has to be an</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.110" end="00:42:18.750" style="s2">right if I try to use inference as my</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.750" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">good inference is my standard for doing</p>

<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:29.220" style="s2">to be evaluate I have to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.350" end="00:42:42.930" style="s2">of this but that&#39;s okay because that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.080" end="00:42:44.940" style="s2">means but Stanovich doesn&#39;t take this as</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.930" end="00:42:47.730" style="s2">deeply as they should but that means</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.940" end="00:42:50.010" style="s2">that there&#39;s a non inferential aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.730" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">rationality that is central there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.010" end="00:42:54.420" style="s2">aspect of rationality that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:56.820" style="s2">with understanding with control that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.420" end="00:43:01.940" style="s2">non inferential in nature and that of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.820" end="00:43:06.060" style="s2">course points back to this because</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.940" end="00:43:08.760" style="s2">relevance is pre and parental the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.060" end="00:43:10.830" style="s2">you formulate your problems remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.760" end="00:43:12.510" style="s2">that has to do with relevance</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.830" end="00:43:21.240" style="s2">realization and that is something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.510" end="00:43:22.920" style="s2">is pre inferential in nature so we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.240" end="00:43:25.740" style="s2">actually put this together very cleanly</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.920" end="00:43:27.870" style="s2">I would argue we can say now see what</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.740" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">Stanovich and West&#39;s say is okay we need</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.870" end="00:43:31.560" style="s2">this normative EVDO and control it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:33.900" style="s2">to be independent of our inferential</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.560" end="00:43:36.120" style="s2">normativity and then they go ah we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.900" end="00:43:37.770" style="s2">know what this is what could it be what</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.120" end="00:43:42.620" style="s2">that normativity of construal would look</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.770" end="00:43:42.620" style="s2">like it&#39;s oh right and it&#39;s like granted</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.390" end="00:43:48.260" style="s2">but here&#39;s a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.250" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">right I think it&#39;s a proposal that sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.670" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">of it&#39;s it&#39;s clearly a right presented</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:03.080" style="s2">to us from a lot of the arguments we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:07.010" style="s2">already considered right we do have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.080" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">normativity on control we have standards</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.010" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">of what a good problem formulation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.740" end="00:44:21.050" style="s2">versus a bad problem formulation where</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.190" end="00:44:21.800" style="s2">do we study that normativity in</p>

<p begin="00:44:21.800" end="00:44:26.570" style="s2">well we study it in insight</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.150" end="00:44:28.730" style="s2">problem-solving we know right</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.570" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">what a bad problem formulation is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.730" end="00:44:32.420" style="s2">problem formulation is one that puts you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:35.240" style="s2">into a combinatorially explosive search</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.420" end="00:44:36.530" style="s2">space a bad problem formulation is one</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.240" end="00:44:39.140" style="s2">that does not turn your ill-defined</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.140" end="00:44:43.849" style="s2">bad problem formulation is one in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.630" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">you are not paying careful attention to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.849" end="00:44:57.140" style="s2">how salience is misleading you so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:45:03.710" style="s2">that&#39;s telling us something really</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.140" end="00:45:07.970" style="s2">interesting right that there is in it in</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.710" end="00:45:11.960" style="s2">addition to inference being crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.970" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">being rational insight is crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.960" end="00:45:16.580" style="s2">being rational too because if what we</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.920" style="s2">mean by insight is somebody who is good</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.580" end="00:45:21.580" style="s2">at formulating problems avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.920" end="00:45:25.580" style="s2">combinatorial explosion of waiting</p>

<p begin="00:45:30.180" end="00:45:39.809" style="s2">right then being insightful is going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.400" end="00:45:42.359" style="s2">be central to being rational it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.809" end="00:45:44.869" style="s2">going to be something that comes up out</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.359" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2">of the irrational aspects of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.869" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">it comes it comes in from the Noren and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:53.039" style="s2">Forenza but why should we be identifying</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:56.599" style="s2">nobody is here</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.039" end="00:46:02.730" style="s2">identifying rationality with just a pure</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.599" end="00:46:06.089" style="s2">logical normativity on inference so what</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.730" end="00:46:09.869" style="s2">I propose to you is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.089" end="00:46:12.869" style="s2">understand the role of both insight and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.869" end="00:46:15.569" style="s2">inference in rationality and that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.869" end="00:46:18.180" style="s2">more problematic but we need that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.569" end="00:46:20.700" style="s2">because we need to integrate rationality</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.180" end="00:46:22.799" style="s2">and understanding together in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.700" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">integrated account and notice how now</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.799" end="00:46:30.029" style="s2">more and more rationality and wisdom are</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">starting to overlap for us in a serious</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.029" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">way because if I now get rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:42.510" style="s2">understanding inference and insight in</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:44.220" style="s2">meshed together then of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.510" end="00:46:46.109" style="s2">starting to talk more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.220" end="00:46:47.910" style="s2">having to happen in a systematic and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.109" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">reliable way I&#39;m starting to talk more</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.910" end="00:46:53.819" style="s2">and more about the ways when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:55.529" style="s2">about how people are wise if we give up</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.819" end="00:47:00.510" style="s2">thinking of rationality as being like</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.529" end="00:47:02.760" style="s2">mr. Spock or mr. data and we give up you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.510" end="00:47:10.470" style="s2">know the the idea that being rational is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.760" end="00:47:15.059" style="s2">just being really smart then we start to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.470" end="00:47:17.970" style="s2">get into the problematic notion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.059" end="00:47:20.279" style="s2">rationality and we need the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.970" end="00:47:22.589" style="s2">multiple competencies we need the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.279" end="00:47:24.510" style="s2">distinction between being logical and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.589" end="00:47:26.760" style="s2">being rational being intelligent being</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.510" end="00:47:28.140" style="s2">rational and we have to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.760" end="00:47:30.390" style="s2">there&#39;s an important component of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.140" end="00:47:32.520" style="s2">rationality that is non inferential in</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.390" end="00:47:36.359" style="s2">nature it has to do with a normativity</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.520" end="00:47:38.309" style="s2">of on construal the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.359" end="00:47:40.559" style="s2">insight not a normativity of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.309" end="00:47:41.690" style="s2">argumentation and the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.559" end="00:47:45.000" style="s2">inference</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.690" end="00:47:47.480" style="s2">right and that&#39;s important that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.000" end="00:47:47.480" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:06.900" style="s2">so the issue of control is acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.320" end="00:48:10.110" style="s2">but not in any way resolved by Stanovich</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.900" end="00:48:14.430" style="s2">so it&#39;s not going to play although it</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.110" end="00:48:15.900" style="s2">should given the his own arguments it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.430" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">not going to play a significant role in</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.900" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">his theory of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.930" end="00:48:24.870" style="s2">what is that theory what does it look</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.070" end="00:48:29.420" style="s2">like what is the missing piece according</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.870" end="00:48:29.420" style="s2">to Stanovich so we said right that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.540" end="00:48:37.380" style="s2">intelligence is not predictive or an</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.410" end="00:48:41.960" style="s2">only weakly predictive of right</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:41.960" style="s2">rationality these are not equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.430" end="00:48:50.490" style="s2">and along the way we got yet another</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:55.529" style="s2">argument for intelligence being</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.490" end="00:48:58.500" style="s2">relevance realization okay that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.529" end="00:49:00.599" style="s2">good what is the missing piece then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.500" end="00:49:02.460" style="s2">relationship here is only 0.3 what</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.599" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">accounts for most of the variance then</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.460" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">as a scientist would say so Stanovich</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:15.809" style="s2">argues very clearly for what he calls a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:18.359" style="s2">cognitive style well this term is</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.809" end="00:49:19.859" style="s2">equipped is a bit equivocal it&#39;s used in</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.359" end="00:49:24.299" style="s2">slightly different ways in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.859" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">for different things and he also invokes</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.299" end="00:49:29.400" style="s2">the notion of bad mind where</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:31.410" style="s2">inappropriate psycho tech so that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.400" end="00:49:33.900" style="s2">in there so there&#39;s there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.410" end="00:49:39.210" style="s2">cognitive styles in psycho tact that can</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.900" end="00:49:41.279" style="s2">both be part of the missing variants so</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.210" end="00:49:46.529" style="s2">what part here is the psycho tech you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.279" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">using right you can have poor what he</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.529" end="00:49:50.549" style="s2">calls mind where which is like software</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:54.569" style="s2">he&#39;s picking up on the psycho tech idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.549" end="00:49:57.390" style="s2">here all right and then the other and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.569" end="00:49:59.130" style="s2">this is what often gets given more</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.390" end="00:50:03.569" style="s2">priority because it accounts for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.130" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">is an appropriate cognitive style the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.569" end="00:50:10.349" style="s2">difference between these are not as as</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:14.849" style="s2">it&#39;s clear I think at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.349" end="00:50:16.710" style="s2">seems to think they are so we&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.849" end="00:50:18.420" style="s2">come back to that when we come back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.710" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">relationship between psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.420" end="00:50:25.170" style="s2">and wisdom so what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.680" end="00:50:28.890" style="s2">cognitive style so a cognitive style is</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.170" end="00:50:31.230" style="s2">an act is something you can learn at</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.890" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">least as Stanovich is using it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.230" end="00:50:36.660" style="s2">to learn a set of sensitivities and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:38.520" style="s2">skills notice the procedure allottee and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.660" end="00:50:42.049" style="s2">the perspectival in here but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.520" end="00:50:45.420" style="s2">implicit it&#39;s in the background right</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.049" end="00:50:48.150" style="s2">but what is the cognitive style that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.420" end="00:50:49.770" style="s2">most predictive of doing well on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.150" end="00:50:51.930" style="s2">reasoning test he gets this from</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.770" end="00:50:55.670" style="s2">Jonathan Barron this is the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.930" end="00:50:55.670" style="s2">active open mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.070" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">and when you see this you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.240" end="00:51:07.030" style="s2">see a lot of stoicism here and this</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:10.660" style="s2">overlaps a lot with the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.030" end="00:51:13.750" style="s2">behavioral therapy that right that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.660" end="00:51:16.300" style="s2">derived from stoicism and again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.750" end="00:51:17.800" style="s2">convergent that&#39;s not by design or</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.300" end="00:51:20.050" style="s2">deliberate and that tells you something</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.800" end="00:51:23.860" style="s2">something crucial is being senior what</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.050" end="00:51:27.460" style="s2">is active open mindedness so active open</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.860" end="00:51:30.850" style="s2">mindedness is to train yourself to look</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.460" end="00:51:38.290" style="s2">for these patterns of self-deception to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.850" end="00:51:40.870" style="s2">look for biases okay so here&#39;s a bias</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.290" end="00:51:42.340" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard me mention you&#39;ve heard me</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.870" end="00:51:48.330" style="s2">mention some of these the confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.340" end="00:51:48.330" style="s2">bias or right the essentialism bias</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.470" end="00:51:54.820" style="s2">right or the representational ism or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.750" end="00:51:57.100" style="s2">availability misusing the availability</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.820" end="00:51:59.110" style="s2">heuristic notice that a bias is just a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.100" end="00:52:01.630" style="s2">heuristic misused we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.110" end="00:52:04.170" style="s2">this so this is I tend to only look for</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.630" end="00:52:07.300" style="s2">information that confirms my beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.170" end="00:52:10.600" style="s2">right this is I tend to treat any</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.300" end="00:52:13.750" style="s2">category as pointing to an essence</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.600" end="00:52:15.190" style="s2">shared by all the members and maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.750" end="00:52:16.810" style="s2">should give up an essential ism of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.190" end="00:52:19.000" style="s2">sacredness or at least in the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.810" end="00:52:22.030" style="s2">its content I&#39;ve already suggested that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.000" end="00:52:24.340" style="s2">to you the availability heuristic is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.030" end="00:52:26.770" style="s2">availability biases I judge some things</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.340" end="00:52:29.050" style="s2">probability by how easily I can remember</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.770" end="00:52:30.670" style="s2">it or imagine it happening we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.050" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2">about all of these there&#39;s many of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.670" end="00:52:33.610" style="s2">so what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:41.170" style="s2">first of all I have to do the science I</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.610" end="00:52:42.760" style="s2">learn about all of these alright so this</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.170" end="00:52:44.530" style="s2">comes from Barron I want to point out</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.760" end="00:52:46.900" style="s2">something that Stan a bitch doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.530" end="00:52:49.360" style="s2">as clearly as Barron does so what I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.900" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">is I learn about these and I sensitize</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.360" end="00:52:54.070" style="s2">myself I sensitize myself and this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:56.800" style="s2">like a virtue because I have to care</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.070" end="00:53:00.370" style="s2">about the process not just the result i</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.800" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">sensitize myself to looking for these</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.370" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">biases in my day-to-day cognition</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.200" end="00:53:13.470" style="s2">and then I actively counteract them I</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.360" end="00:53:16.080" style="s2">actively say no no I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.470" end="00:53:20.070" style="s2">confirmation bias I need to look for</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.080" end="00:53:21.600" style="s2">potential information that will dis</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.070" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">confirm it and here&#39;s where you can now</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.600" end="00:53:24.840" style="s2">begin to also give up the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:26.550" style="s2">individualistic assumption of competence</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.840" end="00:53:29.550" style="s2">part of the way in which I can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.550" end="00:53:31.860" style="s2">rationally competent is I can ask you to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.550" end="00:53:33.690" style="s2">help me overcome my confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.860" end="00:53:35.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s very hard for me to look</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.690" end="00:53:38.030" style="s2">for information that this confirms my</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.880" end="00:53:40.290" style="s2">beliefs it&#39;s much easier for you and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.030" end="00:53:42.750" style="s2">then if I practice with you and not your</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:44.730" style="s2">eye scan start to internalize you and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.750" end="00:53:48.510" style="s2">can start to get better at looking for</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.730" end="00:53:51.360" style="s2">my own instances where I fall prey to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.510" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">the confirmation bias so I now actively</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.360" end="00:53:56.460" style="s2">counteract those that&#39;s sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:54:01.350" style="s2">Stanovich leaves it barren points out</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.460" end="00:54:03.270" style="s2">right but you don&#39;t overdo this because</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.350" end="00:54:07.710" style="s2">if you overdo this you will start to</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.270" end="00:54:10.170" style="s2">choke on the tsunami of combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.710" end="00:54:12.060" style="s2">explosion that it will overwhelm you so</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.170" end="00:54:16.860" style="s2">again you have to do this and you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.060" end="00:54:19.110" style="s2">to do this to the right degree and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.860" end="00:54:21.120" style="s2">becomes much more nebulous and again</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.110" end="00:54:27.150" style="s2">again we&#39;re starting to shade over into</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.120" end="00:54:30.440" style="s2">wisdom right so what you should then ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.150" end="00:54:35.370" style="s2">is what predicts if being intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.440" end="00:54:37.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t predict right if intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.370" end="00:54:39.180" style="s2">predicted rationality then and being</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.470" end="00:54:41.160" style="s2">intelligent would predict how well</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.180" end="00:54:43.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve cultivated active open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.160" end="00:54:45.630" style="s2">but of course it doesn&#39;t so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.500" end="00:54:47.250" style="s2">about people that predicts how well they</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.630" end="00:54:49.590" style="s2">will cultivate active open mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.250" end="00:54:54.060" style="s2">and this is the degree to which people</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.590" end="00:54:58.200" style="s2">have a need for cognition this is people</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.060" end="00:55:00.510" style="s2">who problematize things they create</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.200" end="00:55:03.770" style="s2">problems they look for problems they go</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.510" end="00:55:07.950" style="s2">out and on their own try to learn I</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.770" end="00:55:09.900" style="s2">would add to that there&#39;s two aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.950" end="00:55:12.080" style="s2">need for cognition there is a curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.900" end="00:55:15.000" style="s2">in which I need to have more information</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.080" end="00:55:17.070" style="s2">so that I can manipulate things</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.000" end="00:55:19.140" style="s2">effectively and that&#39;s important people</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.070" end="00:55:22.260" style="s2">that are in that sense more curious and</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.140" end="00:55:24.510" style="s2">want to solve problems not just gather</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.260" end="00:55:26.010" style="s2">facts but solve problems because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.510" end="00:55:29.490" style="s2">what needs for cognition points to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.010" end="00:55:33.480" style="s2">that&#39;s important but also think about</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.490" end="00:55:37.320" style="s2">how important wonder is right how much</p>
