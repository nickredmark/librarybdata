<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">as somebody myself who at one point in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">my life thought that I was going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">full-time professional journalist in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">traditional sense when I was younger my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">only school I ever wanted to go to was</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">Northwestern Medill School of Journalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">I wrote for my high school newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">produced independent sort of zine back</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">in the day and the 90s I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">intrigued and interested to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">journalists and see how they came to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">their profession so that&#39;s my first</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">question for you is how did you get into</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">journalism has this been a lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">calling for you is this something you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">were always interested in or what</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:07.619" style="s2">happened sure the journalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">specifically was not a sort of lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.619" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">aspiration I always wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">writer of some kind since I was very</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">little I want to write</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">stories I was more interested in fiction</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">and yeah I haven&#39;t entirely given up on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">the the dream of sort of moving in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">direction someday but it was in college</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">and then I was all I was always</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:31.080" style="s2">interested in sort of politics and news</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">and history and things like that when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.080" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">when I got to college I became involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">at the University of Michigan I became</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">involved with the student newspaper the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:42.570" style="s2">Michigan daily I actually joined the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:45.630" style="s2">opinion section and I just got more and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.570" end="00:02:48.360" style="s2">more kind of invested and involved and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.630" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">what the newspaper was doing and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:52.710" style="s2">more interested in that sort of work</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">that became sort of like my dominant</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.710" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">extracurricular activity in college so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:02:58.350" style="s2">from there it was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:01.950" style="s2">straightforward you know applying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.350" end="00:03:03.210" style="s2">kinds of journalism internships and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.950" end="00:03:05.520" style="s2">really the first one I&#39;ll and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.210" end="00:03:07.770" style="s2">actually was a dreesen magazine which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.520" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">then got a job at some years later after</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.770" end="00:03:12.740" style="s2">doing some things in between but so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">relatively straightforward path</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.740" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">definitely for people who are interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">in journalism working for a student</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">paper and then getting an internship</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:25.320" style="s2">with a publication you like is the is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:27.290" style="s2">the path that I would recommend is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.320" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">actually more important I think then</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.290" end="00:03:31.410" style="s2">going to a journalism school or</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">explicitly studying journalism in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.410" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">college and that&#39;s not just advice that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:37.250" style="s2">I would give you that&#39;s advice a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:40.290" style="s2">professional journalists would give you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.250" end="00:03:42.330" style="s2">do you think that the traditional routes</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.290" end="00:03:44.610" style="s2">of becoming a journalist and the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.330" end="00:03:45.990" style="s2">traditional destinations for people</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">interested in journalism do you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.990" end="00:03:49.410" style="s2">those are the same as they&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">recent years or do you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">path to journalism as a profession has</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.810" end="00:03:57.330" style="s2">changed at all well I mean certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:03:58.470" style="s2">the path so to some degree the path has</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.330" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">changed tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.470" end="00:04:01.950" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t changed so much for people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">want to go into like a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.950" end="00:04:05.940" style="s2">mainstream journalism profession but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:07.530" style="s2">mean there&#39;s you know gatekeeping has</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.940" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">been eroded there&#39;s all sorts of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.530" end="00:04:11.070" style="s2">just kind of do your own thing and have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">your work taken seriously on social</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.070" end="00:04:16.680" style="s2">media without you kind of going up</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:18.200" style="s2">through normal channels but but the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">kind of actually the journalism school</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.200" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">route has always even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">existed has always kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">something that again but even mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">journalists were a little skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s like this sounds like contrarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:32.670" style="s2">advice that that&#39;s the wrong path but</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:34.230" style="s2">that&#39;s actually something that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.670" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">people in journalism have thought for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.230" end="00:04:38.190" style="s2">long time that it&#39;s better to study you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.770" style="s2">know philosophy political science</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.190" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">history economics like a real sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.770" end="00:04:45.770" style="s2">liberal arts discipline and then just</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:47.730" style="s2">because journalism isn&#39;t really a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.770" end="00:04:49.200" style="s2">obviously they have journalism schools</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.730" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">and some very good ones but journalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.200" end="00:04:53.670" style="s2">is more a craft than it is an academic</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">discipline if you practice it you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.670" end="00:04:57.720" style="s2">better at it so it&#39;s it&#39;s more you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:01.170" style="s2">to be apprenticed in it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.720" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">taught it so to some degree that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.170" end="00:05:04.350" style="s2">always kind of the the better route for</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.420" style="s2">becoming a journalist and that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.350" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">the important route if you kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.420" end="00:05:09.780" style="s2">know if you want to go into a career in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">a mainstream publication or newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:13.590" style="s2">well I certainly would agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">notion that it&#39;s a good idea for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.590" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">journalist to have a grounding in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">other academic field that gives them a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:23.430" style="s2">level of expertise or at least high</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">level functioning utility of the terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.430" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">and the ideas and the understandings</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:28.830" style="s2">that they that they may actually end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">covering I think too many times out</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.830" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">there we see journalists assigned to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:35.400" style="s2">certain beats that have absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">experience in that field and then that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.400" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">leads to some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:40.650" style="s2">interpretations and and qualified</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:42.810" style="s2">reporting I think and from my</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.650" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">perspective but I do appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.810" end="00:05:46.830" style="s2">perspective what did you study in</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:50.130" style="s2">undergrad as an aside I studied English</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.830" end="00:05:53.850" style="s2">literature and I got a minor and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.130" end="00:05:55.260" style="s2">European history and I took a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.850" end="00:05:58.050" style="s2">creative writing I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.260" end="00:06:00.840" style="s2">valuable a lot of my English literature</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.050" end="00:06:03.660" style="s2">classes really were because the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:06.330" style="s2">writing they teach you in those classes</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.660" end="00:06:08.610" style="s2">the sort of academic writing I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.330" end="00:06:10.500" style="s2">it&#39;s unsuited to I mean it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.610" end="00:06:12.360" style="s2">unsuited to all the writing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.500" end="00:06:14.010" style="s2">everyone does whether they work in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.360" end="00:06:16.890" style="s2">explicit writing career or not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.010" end="00:06:19.110" style="s2">it&#39;s unsuited to writing good emails or</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.890" end="00:06:20.820" style="s2">press releases or or and then certainly</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.110" end="00:06:23.760" style="s2">doing journalism I mean nobody kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.820" end="00:06:25.669" style="s2">writes at the like eight page you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.760" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">beating a thesis to death</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.669" end="00:06:31.020" style="s2">incomprehensible academic jargon that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:32.640" style="s2">has really taught in a lot of not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.020" end="00:06:34.860" style="s2">English but just kind of academia in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.640" end="00:06:36.270" style="s2">general but my I would say that my I</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.860" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">took a lot of creative writing classes</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.270" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">again because I have this interest in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">writing fiction and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:44.759" style="s2">those classes I thought were were</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:46.889" style="s2">tremendously helpful at improving my</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.759" end="00:06:48.439" style="s2">again improving the improving the craft</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.889" end="00:06:50.669" style="s2">of writing the craft of storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.439" end="00:06:53.310" style="s2">well you&#39;ve really done a great job with</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.669" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">that I&#39;ve read your book panic attack</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.310" end="00:06:57.000" style="s2">recently and you did a great job we</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:58.439" style="s2">should be commended for that I found the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.000" end="00:07:00.539" style="s2">narratives to be engaging and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.439" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">stories to be interesting provocative</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.539" end="00:07:04.280" style="s2">and then you were able to really deliver</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">a whole lot of substantive information</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.280" end="00:07:08.039" style="s2">in that framework which I which I really</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:10.469" style="s2">appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.039" end="00:07:12.120" style="s2">back just one more question about reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.469" end="00:07:14.280" style="s2">how did you end up coming to reason in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.120" end="00:07:15.990" style="s2">particular were you drawn there because</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.280" end="00:07:18.150" style="s2">of the mission it is a nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.990" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">organization some people might call it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.150" end="00:07:22.770" style="s2">sort of activist journalism what do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.629" style="s2">think about that how did you come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.770" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">reason how does it fit with your</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.629" end="00:07:28.889" style="s2">worldview did your worldview lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:31.529" style="s2">reason as a reason shape your worldview</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.889" end="00:07:33.719" style="s2">what do you think about that so yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.529" end="00:07:36.779" style="s2">my worldview definitely led me to reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.719" end="00:07:39.509" style="s2">I I&#39;m a libertarian reasons a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.779" end="00:07:40.949" style="s2">libertarian publication I became</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.509" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">libertarian or became aware of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.949" end="00:07:46.099" style="s2">libertarian ideas sort of in between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:48.090" style="s2">transition from high school to college</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.099" end="00:07:51.650" style="s2">so it was when I was starting out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.090" end="00:07:54.569" style="s2">college that I was sort of first</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:07:57.449" style="s2">becoming aware of libertarian philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.569" end="00:08:00.779" style="s2">and and who those thinkers are looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.449" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">at limited government philosophy and I I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.779" end="00:08:05.490" style="s2">think I I started becoming aware that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:07.080" style="s2">there was a sort of network of think</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.490" end="00:08:09.779" style="s2">tanks and organizations that are broadly</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.080" end="00:08:12.389" style="s2">promoting libertarian goals and one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.779" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">them the one that was most known in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.389" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">journalism sense was Reason magazine so</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:22.889" style="s2">I very quickly on aspired to get to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">an internship there and the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.889" end="00:08:27.659" style="s2">there&#39;s a professional libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:31.289" style="s2">Network that was able to connect me with</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.659" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">reason to do that internship and to kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.289" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">of be on my way so yeah pretty standard</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:38.339" style="s2">in some ways but I certainly was</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:42.690" style="s2">interested in reason for for its ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.339" end="00:08:44.670" style="s2">and do you think that reason stands is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.690" end="00:08:47.250" style="s2">there any is there any way to criticism</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.670" end="00:08:48.790" style="s2">that it is act activist journalism given</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.250" end="00:08:51.460" style="s2">that there is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.790" end="00:08:53.410" style="s2">that worldview behind you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.460" end="00:08:55.540" style="s2">donors and and the the people the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.410" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">editors and sort of the mission do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.540" end="00:09:00.190" style="s2">ever feel constrained by that or do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.260" style="s2">feel like you can do straight clean</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.190" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">journalism there without having to keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.260" end="00:09:06.130" style="s2">in mind sort of the mission in general</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:08.400" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t feel constrained at all I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.130" end="00:09:10.780" style="s2">mean I look I share the mission so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.400" end="00:09:14.140" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty wholeheartedly so there</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.780" end="00:09:16.710" style="s2">would be no conflict there activist is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.140" end="00:09:20.770" style="s2">probably not the word I would use</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.710" end="00:09:23.740" style="s2">because to me activism implies maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.770" end="00:09:26.110" style="s2">just not just advocacy but that you&#39;re I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.740" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">don&#39;t know doing doing some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.110" end="00:09:30.550" style="s2">political action like you&#39;re organizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:31.900" style="s2">or you&#39;re handing out flyers or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.550" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">trying to elect a candidate or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.900" end="00:09:36.430" style="s2">doing some something like that we&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:39.940" style="s2">we&#39;re uh we have opinions we&#39;re we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.430" end="00:09:42.400" style="s2">magazine and we&#39;re open about what our</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.940" end="00:09:44.980" style="s2">opinions are no one would mistake us I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.400" end="00:09:46.570" style="s2">don&#39;t think for for a newspaper that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.980" end="00:09:48.850" style="s2">just kind of doing straight news</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.570" end="00:09:51.010" style="s2">reporting on a subject of course you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.850" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">know we also I mean I talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.010" end="00:09:54.910" style="s2">how I think this so the quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:56.410" style="s2">objective journalists are just you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.910" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">just giving you the facts just giving</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.410" end="00:09:59.320" style="s2">you the news well of course they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:01.450" style="s2">their own ideas and their own agendas</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.320" end="00:10:03.910" style="s2">and their own biases to some many of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.450" end="00:10:05.650" style="s2">them have you know very well-thought-out</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.910" end="00:10:07.450" style="s2">worldviews it would be it&#39;s insane</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.650" end="00:10:10.750" style="s2">actually to expect people not to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.450" end="00:10:12.910" style="s2">form a larger ideological conviction if</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.750" end="00:10:14.290" style="s2">they&#39;re writing about public policy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.910" end="00:10:17.280" style="s2">ideas and the news and what people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.290" end="00:10:20.110" style="s2">saying and doing so to kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.280" end="00:10:22.690" style="s2">twosome in some ways I find the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.110" end="00:10:24.850" style="s2">pretense of objectivity that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.690" end="00:10:28.900" style="s2">practiced by you know straight news</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.850" end="00:10:32.110" style="s2">reporters to be kind of silly so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.900" end="00:10:34.870" style="s2">you know we&#39;re a magazine where our we</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.110" end="00:10:36.730" style="s2">have views about how what we think is</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.870" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">sound public policy that inform our</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.730" end="00:10:41.080" style="s2">writing that is the background of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:43.150" style="s2">journalism but we&#39;re still very much</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.080" end="00:10:44.830" style="s2">practicing good hard journalism where</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.150" end="00:10:48.790" style="s2">were where we&#39;re interviewing people</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.830" end="00:10:51.390" style="s2">were were you know filing public records</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.790" end="00:10:54.100" style="s2">requests for information I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.390" end="00:10:56.230" style="s2">probably in a way that the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.100" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">ideology works to the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.230" end="00:11:00.300" style="s2">Journal of journalism that an explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:03.050" style="s2">that a libertarian ideology does is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.300" end="00:11:06.690" style="s2">Taran&#39;s are naturally skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.050" end="00:11:08.850" style="s2">naturally suspicious of authority</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.690" end="00:11:10.440" style="s2">particularly government authority so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.850" end="00:11:13.380" style="s2">don&#39;t you know we don&#39;t just credulous</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.440" end="00:11:16.620" style="s2">Li believe everything we&#39;re told by by</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.380" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">law enforcement by politicians etc and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.620" end="00:11:22.500" style="s2">that is a beneficial approach that more</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">that and then meant that one that many</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.500" end="00:11:27.570" style="s2">mainstream reporters who are successful</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:30.060" style="s2">do adopt and have adopted that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.570" end="00:11:31.830" style="s2">that&#39;s very much a good thing yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.060" end="00:11:33.690" style="s2">agree and in my conversation I had with</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.830" end="00:11:37.230" style="s2">your colleague Elizabeth Nolan Brown a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.690" end="00:11:39.210" style="s2">while back she was she said that if</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.230" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">there is a clear viewpoint but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.210" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">pen sorry there is a viewpoint but it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:44.340" style="s2">clear and it&#39;s explicit and it&#39;s stated</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.780" style="s2">which does bring a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.340" end="00:11:47.070" style="s2">transparency than some of these other</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.780" end="00:11:48.650" style="s2">folks who are operating with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.070" end="00:11:51.870" style="s2">viewpoint that they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.650" end="00:11:55.140" style="s2">disclose all the time and I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.870" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">certainly being sympathetic to and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.140" end="00:11:59.520" style="s2">appreciating many libertarian arguments</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.420" end="00:12:01.740" style="s2">so I find I find your guys work to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.520" end="00:12:03.930" style="s2">very interesting and certainly we have a</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.930" end="00:12:07.710" style="s2">of focus and we&#39;re gonna talk actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.120" end="00:12:11.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a theme I want to touch on later</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.710" end="00:12:14.970" style="s2">which is overlapping or common and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.520" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">unifying goals of disparate groups and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.970" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">think maybe you would understand why</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:20.490" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get there at some point</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:23.160" style="s2">given that you did write the book all</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.490" end="00:12:25.110" style="s2">about you know activists in the age of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.160" end="00:12:26.580" style="s2">Trump and why and how people come</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:27.960" style="s2">together to work together towards a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.580" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">cause even if they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.960" end="00:12:33.510" style="s2">have all of their interests aligned and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:35.580" style="s2">speaking of the book it&#39;s called panic</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.510" end="00:12:37.560" style="s2">attack young radicals in the age of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.580" end="00:12:40.020" style="s2">Trump I read it it is excellent I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.560" end="00:12:42.270" style="s2">recommend it to everyone it is available</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.020" end="00:12:44.550" style="s2">on Amazon right now and Robbie I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.270" end="00:12:47.220" style="s2">to ask you how did you how did this book</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.550" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">come to be what what was the impetus for</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.220" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">it how long did you work on it what did</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.410" end="00:12:53.160" style="s2">you do to make it happen it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:54.660" style="s2">fantastic piece and it&#39;s obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.160" end="00:12:55.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton of work that went into it</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.660" end="00:12:57.330" style="s2">so tell me a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.770" end="00:13:01.470" style="s2">genesis of panic attack</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.330" end="00:13:04.820" style="s2">sure so I I became I would say I became</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.470" end="00:13:07.530" style="s2">interested in higher education issues</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.820" end="00:13:10.580" style="s2">when I was in college working for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.530" end="00:13:12.030" style="s2">for the paper I found the the papers</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.580" end="00:13:13.649" style="s2">investigations into what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.030" end="00:13:16.439" style="s2">administration was doing very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.649" end="00:13:18.629" style="s2">interesting I thought nationally there</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.439" end="00:13:21.149" style="s2">was a lot of attention paid to education</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.629" end="00:13:24.089" style="s2">issues in general but often targeted at</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.149" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">K through 12 where a lot of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.089" end="00:13:27.389" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know school choice</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.230" end="00:13:29.009" style="s2">there&#39;s one category of things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.389" end="00:13:30.449" style="s2">curriculum there&#39;s you know some and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.009" end="00:13:32.629" style="s2">social conservatives are unhappy with</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.449" end="00:13:35.759" style="s2">you know what goes on in our schools etc</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.629" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">education is a big issue I thought again</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.759" end="00:13:40.470" style="s2">this is back in 2000 the sort of 2008</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:42.329" style="s2">2009 2010 when I was still an</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.470" end="00:13:46.470" style="s2">undergraduate I thought higher education</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.329" end="00:13:49.410" style="s2">was very interesting not not as as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.470" end="00:13:50.490" style="s2">covered so I I kind of early on and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.410" end="00:13:52.110" style="s2">that&#39;s an important thing to do as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.490" end="00:13:53.910" style="s2">journalist you&#39;ve got a kind of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.110" end="00:13:55.110" style="s2">pick an area of specialization or an</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.910" end="00:13:57.689" style="s2">area where you think you can add</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.110" end="00:13:59.670" style="s2">something to the conversation so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.689" end="00:14:00.990" style="s2">decided that should be what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.670" end="00:14:02.429" style="s2">on college campuses and for a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.990" end="00:14:05.069" style="s2">while I thought that was mostly going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.429" end="00:14:07.170" style="s2">be actually the financial side of higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.069" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">education student loans that kind of</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:13.499" style="s2">but as my career developed I became very</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.129" end="00:14:17.129" style="s2">interested in the kinds of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.499" end="00:14:19.050" style="s2">issues on college campuses the the free</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.420" end="00:14:32.730" style="s2">conservative students and and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.559" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">of formal structures that were</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.730" end="00:14:37.499" style="s2">facilitating that it turned out that the</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.100" end="00:14:44.519" style="s2">a lot of national interest in</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.899" end="00:14:56.339" style="s2">started to think about what well what</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.509" end="00:14:58.769" style="s2">are the broader cultural changes that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.339" end="00:14:59.939" style="s2">are informing this you know I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.769" end="00:15:02.699" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing some very interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.939" end="00:15:04.470" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing that a you know college</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.699" end="00:15:07.559" style="s2">campuses broadly speaking have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.470" end="00:15:09.449" style="s2">people on the left on them and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.559" end="00:15:12.679" style="s2">seeing what appears to be a mounting</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.449" end="00:15:15.769" style="s2">sort of hostility to what I would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.679" end="00:15:18.839" style="s2">formerly thought of to be pretty solid</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.769" end="00:15:21.179" style="s2">leftist principles that I actually</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.179" end="00:15:26.610" style="s2">free speech and due process I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.490" end="00:15:28.740" style="s2">these things come under attack from</p>

<p begin="00:15:43.079" end="00:15:46.709" style="s2">was very interesting and the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.750" end="00:15:49.560" style="s2">reading my articles thought they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.709" end="00:15:51.480" style="s2">interesting an agent came to me a a</p>

<p begin="00:15:53.100" end="00:15:56.850" style="s2">for a book here will you put together an</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.850" end="00:16:02.070" style="s2">that whole process took it took a long</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.910" end="00:16:03.660" style="s2">amount of time and then writing the book</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.070" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">took a good amount of time I visited a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.660" end="00:16:10.680" style="s2">number of college campuses to to do as I</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:13.380" style="s2">like to do reporting I really like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.680" end="00:16:15.959" style="s2">talk to people to to describe their</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.959" end="00:16:24.510" style="s2">generally characterize people without</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:28.529" style="s2">themselves so I did a lot of a good</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.529" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">kind of put together a book that looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:38.550" style="s2">at how how the activist culture has</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:41.550" style="s2">evolved in recent years or even in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.070" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">old left and I spent a lot of time on</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.410" end="00:16:50.250" style="s2">the left but I do look a little bit at</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:52.290" style="s2">the right as well there have been very</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.250" end="00:16:56.640" style="s2">interesting changes taking place among</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.290" end="00:16:59.070" style="s2">kind of young conservative activism not</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.640" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">in I say in the age of Trump is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.070" end="00:17:02.850" style="s2">subtitle of the book it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">necessarily all because of Trump but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.850" end="00:17:07.559" style="s2">is happening during the Trump phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:11.309" style="s2">so I looked at how the write was</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.559" end="00:17:13.949" style="s2">changing as well so that&#39;s so that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.309" end="00:17:15.780" style="s2">then it came out came out last year so</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.949" end="00:17:17.309" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.780" end="00:17:20.280" style="s2">these things are I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.309" end="00:17:22.740" style="s2">I stress that you know some some people</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.280" end="00:17:24.990" style="s2">make too much out of out of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.740" end="00:17:26.730" style="s2">on on campuses you know not every small</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.759" style="s2">whether it&#39;s in government whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.049" end="00:18:25.409" style="s2">in the legal profession or whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.759" end="00:18:27.509" style="s2">whether it&#39;s working for important and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.409" end="00:18:29.370" style="s2">influential companies companies that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.509" end="00:18:30.990" style="s2">setting the rules of how we speak to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.370" end="00:18:34.110" style="s2">each other online like Facebook Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.990" end="00:18:37.350" style="s2">etc so so that&#39;s that&#39;s my pitch for why</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.110" end="00:18:39.029" style="s2">I think it it&#39;s it&#39;s worth it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.350" end="00:18:41.519" style="s2">important not just because of what it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.029" end="00:18:43.889" style="s2">means for life on campuses yeah you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.519" end="00:18:46.350" style="s2">definitely hit on some key themes that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.889" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about for a while now</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.350" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">and especially with my last podcast that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:53.419" style="s2">I did with James Lindsay known as</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">conceptual James on Twitter he has</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.419" end="00:18:59.720" style="s2">really done a tremendous job in taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:01.889" style="s2">some of the theories and academic work</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.720" end="00:19:03.809" style="s2">starting with post-modernism and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.889" end="00:19:04.950" style="s2">tracing it through I think a number of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.809" end="00:19:07.129" style="s2">things we&#39;re going to talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.950" end="00:19:09.960" style="s2">including radical feminism</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.129" end="00:19:13.620" style="s2">intersectionality trans issues ablest</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.960" end="00:19:15.750" style="s2">issues fat issues things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.620" end="00:19:17.250" style="s2">you really you really definitely hit on</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.750" end="00:19:19.559" style="s2">one of the key themes just there which</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.250" end="00:19:22.919" style="s2">is there may be a minority of students</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.559" end="00:19:25.320" style="s2">on campus who are sort of like the flag</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.919" end="00:19:27.330" style="s2">bearers for these kind of movements but</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:30.769" style="s2">as you correctly identify in your book</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.330" end="00:19:33.559" style="s2">and just now the advocates for these</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.769" end="00:19:36.929" style="s2">issues are in high leverage positions</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.559" end="00:19:39.419" style="s2">it&#39;s come to control the university and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.929" end="00:19:40.529" style="s2">academic life through federal policy</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.419" end="00:19:42.809" style="s2">which work definitely going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.529" end="00:19:46.110" style="s2">about and then because a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.809" end="00:19:47.850" style="s2">stuff is elite based you know students</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.110" end="00:19:49.470" style="s2">who then go on to powerful positions</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.850" end="00:19:50.160" style="s2">they&#39;re then taking these ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.470" end="00:19:52.380" style="s2">infiltrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:54.300" style="s2">all throughout our entire culture are</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.380" end="00:19:57.000" style="s2">basically universities and media and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.300" end="00:20:00.270" style="s2">corporations all across the board and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.000" end="00:20:02.160" style="s2">there is a tyranny of the minority that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.270" end="00:20:03.930" style="s2">is taking place and in some some</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.160" end="00:20:06.180" style="s2">instances and and and it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.930" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">seeing this like very high leverage</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.180" end="00:20:11.430" style="s2">behavior that these activists in these</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:13.620" style="s2">policies have in order to really change</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.430" end="00:20:15.450" style="s2">the nature even of the the human</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.620" end="00:20:17.160" style="s2">relationships and things that happen in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.450" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">the dark behind closed doors among young</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.160" end="00:20:21.000" style="s2">people and that&#39;s really what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">talk about with you today and in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.000" end="00:20:24.300" style="s2">book you start off talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:25.920" style="s2">intersectionality which is something I</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.300" end="00:20:27.480" style="s2">have talked about for quite a while too</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.920" end="00:20:30.380" style="s2">but I would like to get your take on it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.480" end="00:20:32.550" style="s2">because I have my my positions in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.380" end="00:20:34.170" style="s2">perspective that I have articulated</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.550" end="00:20:36.660" style="s2">through my sort of personal narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.170" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">I spoke with James Lindsay who gave his</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.660" end="00:20:40.200" style="s2">perspective based on the academic</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.460" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">literature and the scholarly work and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:44.790" style="s2">I&#39;m finding a really nice compliment</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:46.500" style="s2">here with your work which is sort of on</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.790" end="00:20:48.810" style="s2">the ground engaging with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.500" end="00:20:50.160" style="s2">are engaging with these ideas and so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.810" end="00:20:52.890" style="s2">may have a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.160" end="00:20:55.680" style="s2">perspective one that&#39;s useful and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.890" end="00:20:57.090" style="s2">fresh for me to hear and so I would love</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.680" end="00:21:00.330" style="s2">for you to explain a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.090" end="00:21:02.250" style="s2">how you came even to you know came</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.330" end="00:21:05.310" style="s2">across this notion of intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.250" end="00:21:08.340" style="s2">what did you come to find it to mean and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.310" end="00:21:10.230" style="s2">and how have you seen it sort of play</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.340" end="00:21:12.360" style="s2">out in our culture today because I</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.230" end="00:21:14.100" style="s2">really think it&#39;s important and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.360" end="00:21:15.270" style="s2">something that you know 9 out of 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.100" end="00:21:17.940" style="s2">people on the street probably had never</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.270" end="00:21:20.580" style="s2">even heard of yeah so intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.940" end="00:21:23.130" style="s2">is a word that I think you&#39;re you hear</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.580" end="00:21:24.570" style="s2">much more often you think five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.130" end="00:21:25.620" style="s2">almost never no one would have heard</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.570" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">what it is now it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.620" end="00:21:28.860" style="s2">like all young people are using it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:30.870" style="s2">interesting always how young people</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.860" end="00:21:34.290" style="s2">adapt language or how the how the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.870" end="00:21:36.390" style="s2">culture of activism kind of spreads</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.290" end="00:21:37.680" style="s2">outward just to use culture in general</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.390" end="00:21:41.100" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s definitely happened</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.680" end="00:21:42.540" style="s2">with intersectionality I won&#39;t define it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.100" end="00:21:43.770" style="s2">at great length since you already talked</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.540" end="00:21:46.380" style="s2">about a little bit but of course it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.770" end="00:21:49.980" style="s2">know it comes out of academia in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.380" end="00:21:52.920" style="s2">1980s kimberlé crenshaw was the legal</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.980" end="00:21:55.770" style="s2">scholar who proposed the word she needed</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.920" end="00:21:57.750" style="s2">a way to describe different sources of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.770" end="00:21:59.220" style="s2">oppression she was saying that well if</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.750" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">you&#39;re a woman you&#39;ve been oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.220" end="00:22:02.410" style="s2">historically women had been oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:04.600" style="s2">because of their gender</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.410" end="00:22:06.520" style="s2">uh people of color black people have</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.600" end="00:22:08.680" style="s2">been oppressed because of their their</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.520" end="00:22:10.660" style="s2">skin color so so gender is a source of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.680" end="00:22:12.220" style="s2">oppression and racism oppression but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.660" end="00:22:13.930" style="s2">what if you&#39;re a black woman then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.220" end="00:22:16.630" style="s2">have two sources of oppression working</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.930" end="00:22:19.900" style="s2">against you and they kind of overlap or</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.630" end="00:22:23.320" style="s2">they stack in a way and they result in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.900" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">more more marginalizing experience for</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.320" end="00:22:26.050" style="s2">you than if you only had one or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">other status working against you and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.050" end="00:22:30.670" style="s2">then of course in subsequent kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:33.790" style="s2">writings of other scholars and in other</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.670" end="00:22:35.050" style="s2">categories class which is actually a the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.790" end="00:22:37.270" style="s2">category of oppression that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:39.250" style="s2">predates these as the one that the left</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.270" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">was very worked up about but then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.250" end="00:22:42.730" style="s2">can have you know you gender but also</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.620" style="s2">gender expression gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.730" end="00:22:47.080" style="s2">there&#39;s so there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.620" end="00:22:51.610" style="s2">subcategories of oppression even in</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.080" end="00:22:54.760" style="s2">gender sexuality obviously and but then</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.610" end="00:22:57.370" style="s2">also disability status age size all</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.760" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">sorts of other things all are being</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.370" end="00:23:03.880" style="s2">under the under a kind of intersectional</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.120" end="00:23:07.180" style="s2">framework are being discussed as sources</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.880" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">of oppression that stack so again if</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.180" end="00:23:11.100" style="s2">it&#39;s to the extent that it&#39;s a theory if</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:13.330" style="s2">intersectionality just means that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.100" end="00:23:16.060" style="s2">different people have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.330" end="00:23:18.580" style="s2">different oppression based on different</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.060" end="00:23:21.130" style="s2">characteristics and the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.580" end="00:23:22.570" style="s2">characteristics you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.130" end="00:23:24.910" style="s2">running against you I guess the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.570" end="00:23:27.190" style="s2">likely you would have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.910" end="00:23:28.780" style="s2">depression or or people yet it sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.190" end="00:23:30.820" style="s2">that&#39;s true you know there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.780" end="00:23:32.380" style="s2">which it&#39;s just a mundane obviously true</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.820" end="00:23:34.780" style="s2">observation that I that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.380" end="00:23:36.460" style="s2">anyone would find that controversial so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.780" end="00:23:39.910" style="s2">it&#39;s really not it&#39;s not an issue with</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.460" end="00:23:43.090" style="s2">the idea of intersectionality itself but</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.910" end="00:23:44.860" style="s2">it&#39;s become again I I&#39;ve described it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.090" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">the book as the operating system for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.860" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">modern left it became a an activist</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:53.770" style="s2">framework there I mean there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:57.040" style="s2">tendency among kind of leftist social</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.770" end="00:23:59.380" style="s2">justice II concepts to it to always be</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.630" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">is something benign but then it</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.730" end="00:24:08.350" style="s2">encompasses this whole set of norms for</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:09.250" style="s2">how you should approach the world and</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.870" end="00:24:19.119" style="s2">become that</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.710" end="00:25:00.309" style="s2">to you know to want people who are</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.539" end="00:25:06.609" style="s2">but the since they&#39;ve added so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.509" end="00:25:08.200" style="s2">categories you start to get down to ones</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.609" end="00:25:09.850" style="s2">that are still a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.200" end="00:25:12.249" style="s2">controversial even among you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.850" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">broadly liberal people or where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.249" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">still kind of figuring out alright where</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:19.779" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a it is reasonable for a</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.220" end="00:25:40.359" style="s2">on trans issues but there&#39;s still some</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.259" end="00:25:42.399" style="s2">some difficulties to be worked out with</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.359" end="00:25:44.529" style="s2">the well what happens in schools and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.399" end="00:25:48.460" style="s2">sports teams and that kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.529" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">that really is not crazy or hateful at</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.460" end="00:25:52.749" style="s2">all to discuss but but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:54.639" style="s2">intersectional activists would say well</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.749" end="00:25:56.409" style="s2">because you&#39;re not with you know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.639" end="00:25:59.470" style="s2">because you&#39;re not on board with what</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.409" end="00:26:00.489" style="s2">the most progressive trans activists</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.470" end="00:26:02.919" style="s2">would think about this issue</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.489" end="00:26:03.999" style="s2">you are dead to us we do we want nothing</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.919" end="00:26:06.929" style="s2">to do with you that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.999" end="00:26:10.119" style="s2">intersectionality dictates additionally</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.929" end="00:26:13.059" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of jostling for power or</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.119" end="00:26:17.590" style="s2">for authority in activist circles where</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.059" end="00:26:19.210" style="s2">the person with the most matrixes of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.590" end="00:26:21.070" style="s2">oppression working against them is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.210" end="00:26:23.590" style="s2">person with the most authority so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.070" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">your if so if you are a person of color</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.590" end="00:26:28.090" style="s2">but also a trans person also you&#39;re poor</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:28.580" style="s2">also you&#39;re you have all these other</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.090" end="00:26:30.500" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.580" end="00:26:31.880" style="s2">you are seen as being an authority on</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.500" end="00:26:34.549" style="s2">more issues because you&#39;re not because</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.880" end="00:26:36.440" style="s2">the the oppressed are themselves the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.549" end="00:26:37.610" style="s2">authority on these issues although also</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.440" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to ask them to speak</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.610" end="00:26:42.019" style="s2">for themselves because that further risk</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:43.100" style="s2">traumatizing them so there&#39;s also again</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.019" end="00:26:45.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a contradiction there as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.100" end="00:26:47.899" style="s2">but there&#39;s an expectation that we step</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.500" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">back and listen to the victims</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.899" end="00:26:52.399" style="s2">themselves the new victims of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:55.330" style="s2">oppression and the the which again</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.399" end="00:26:58.399" style="s2">that&#39;s not the craziest thing at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.330" end="00:27:00.590" style="s2">generally probably we the people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.399" end="00:27:02.210" style="s2">have first-hand knowledge of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.590" end="00:27:04.580" style="s2">of source of suffering probably do have</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.210" end="00:27:07.370" style="s2">something to tell us and should be and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.580" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">and that experience should be an</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.370" end="00:27:11.029" style="s2">additional piece of weight for why we</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.190" style="s2">might consider what they have to say but</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.029" end="00:27:16.450" style="s2">the issue that I&#39;ve noticed with this</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.190" end="00:27:18.919" style="s2">becomes that well what so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.450" end="00:27:20.899" style="s2">show a competition to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.919" end="00:27:22.639" style="s2">oppressed or to seem like you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.899" end="00:27:25.190" style="s2">most oppressed can have negative</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.639" end="00:27:26.870" style="s2">incentives whereby so what do you do if</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.190" end="00:27:28.639" style="s2">you know you&#39;re just like a white dude a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.870" end="00:27:30.500" style="s2">very woke very liberal progressive white</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.639" end="00:27:33.019" style="s2">dude but who does not fall into one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.500" end="00:27:35.539" style="s2">these categories what I&#39;ve realized is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.019" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">that mental health is itself a category</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.539" end="00:27:40.070" style="s2">of oppression the mentally ill are</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">oppressed so you you see this and like</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.070" end="00:27:43.190" style="s2">this is this is true this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.620" style="s2">phenomenon I&#39;ve noticed where there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.190" end="00:27:47.779" style="s2">tendency to describe as them as the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.620" end="00:27:50.330" style="s2">salient thing about yourself how you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.779" end="00:27:51.860" style="s2">suffer from mental health issues how you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.330" end="00:27:54.260" style="s2">have post you&#39;re a survivor of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.860" end="00:27:56.299" style="s2">post-traumatic stress you&#39;re you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.260" end="00:27:59.960" style="s2">victim of mental abuse something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.299" end="00:28:02.179" style="s2">that where often that&#39;s like the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.960" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">thing listed about activists people on</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.179" end="00:28:06.230" style="s2">their biographies unlike their sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:11.269" style="s2">social justice Center at the University</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.230" end="00:28:13.490" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s like it&#39;s in a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.269" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">real sense not healthy to create an</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.490" end="00:28:18.529" style="s2">incentive structure where people want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:20.899" style="s2">see themselves as mentally unwell like</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.529" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">that like just that&#39;s that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.899" end="00:28:26.570" style="s2">not good that&#39;s an idea we shouldn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:29.210" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t want people to overemphasize</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.570" end="00:28:31.639" style="s2">their life experience or it reinterpret</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.210" end="00:28:33.080" style="s2">their life experiences as deeply having</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.639" end="00:28:34.789" style="s2">been deeply traumatizing or traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.080" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">when they actually weren&#39;t so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.789" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">that&#39;s an important criticism again not</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:41.659" style="s2">a criticism of simply the the mere</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">theory of intersectionality but a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.659" end="00:28:43.650" style="s2">criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">how it has come to be used in these</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.650" end="00:28:48.780" style="s2">activist circles yeah I think Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:51.450" style="s2">hate has a lucid eight at this point</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.780" end="00:28:53.040" style="s2">very clearly in both his book and essay</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.700" end="00:29:01.260" style="s2">into what he deemed victim culture and</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.260" end="00:29:05.820" style="s2">points which is actually and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.900" end="00:29:08.280" style="s2">slew of other reasons to which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.820" end="00:29:10.710" style="s2">actually why intersectional thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.280" end="00:29:12.840" style="s2">be operationalized federal policies that</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.840" end="00:29:16.740" style="s2">people to be mentally ill and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.790" end="00:29:20.100" style="s2">functioning in the exact opposite way</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.740" end="00:29:21.690" style="s2">that psychiatrists and psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:23.670" style="s2">would suggest that a healthy person</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.670" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">be sort of along the lines of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.530" end="00:29:29.040" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy like being</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:37.950" style="s2">accurate whereas we&#39;re teaching people</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.490" end="00:30:45.630" style="s2">understood and so that is that is the</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.370" end="00:30:51.420" style="s2">word is that if there&#39;s all these people</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.649" end="00:31:09.940" style="s2">interesting with intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.419" end="00:31:12.969" style="s2">because it sort of brings people</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.249" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">as well so in your book you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.979" end="00:31:25.119" style="s2">the intersectional the critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:28.239" style="s2">intersectionality and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.119" end="00:31:30.639" style="s2">reactions to it and I wanted to try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.239" end="00:31:33.309" style="s2">lay out like three different groups that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.639" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">are have like a CO centric circle or at</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.309" end="00:31:37.690" style="s2">least share some elements of a Venn</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:39.729" style="s2">diagram and there are people like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.690" end="00:31:42.579" style="s2">yourself and like myself I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.729" end="00:31:44.709" style="s2">have a very legitimate you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.579" end="00:31:46.959" style="s2">rationally based criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.709" end="00:31:50.409" style="s2">intersectionality but then there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.959" end="00:31:53.949" style="s2">people who you outlined as being immense</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.409" end="00:31:55.749" style="s2">rights advocates or big toes or and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.949" end="00:31:58.509" style="s2">you even expand a circle to say people</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.749" end="00:32:01.329" style="s2">who are like alright all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.509" end="00:32:03.849" style="s2">groups have a similar critique of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.329" end="00:32:05.469" style="s2">intersectionality and of some of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.469" end="00:32:10.619" style="s2">but they have also different goals after</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:14.109" style="s2">that and it also makes for some very</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.619" end="00:32:16.719" style="s2">unsettling sort of bedfellows or people</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.109" end="00:32:17.469" style="s2">who see a particular issue the same way</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.179" end="00:32:31.479" style="s2">then look around at some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.529" end="00:32:34.089" style="s2">people who were sort of on your same</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.479" end="00:32:36.219" style="s2">side and did you ever wonder like you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.089" end="00:32:38.409" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on here why do I have</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.629" end="00:32:54.009" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s an experience I have all</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.009" end="00:33:00.119" style="s2">I&#39;ll say as someone who defends kind of</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.119" end="00:33:04.839" style="s2">principles or due process or something</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.430" end="00:33:14.980" style="s2">that well they&#39;re gonna defend X person</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.530" end="00:33:17.470" style="s2">or X group or X identity because they</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.300" end="00:33:27.340" style="s2">reason and I&#39;m also defending them</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.740" end="00:33:29.230" style="s2">because I could be for a for what I mean</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.230" end="00:33:31.990" style="s2">and then I&#39;m also gonna defend people on</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.990" end="00:33:36.100" style="s2">but a lot would so so so many other</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.180" end="00:36:22.180" style="s2">mean today just this morning I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.890" end="00:36:24.250" style="s2">about I finally wrote about the Michael</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.180" end="00:36:26.410" style="s2">Flint case this is a little bit far</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.250" end="00:36:29.460" style="s2">afield but you know this is this the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.410" end="00:36:31.510" style="s2">former National Security Advisor who was</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.460" end="00:36:32.950" style="s2">prosecuted for lying to FBI officials as</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.510" end="00:36:35.020" style="s2">part of the rush occlusion investigation</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.950" end="00:36:38.290" style="s2">and now the the case is falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.020" end="00:36:40.090" style="s2">and so all everybody on the right is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.290" end="00:36:41.470" style="s2">know some like oh he was mistreated and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.090" end="00:36:43.960" style="s2">you know this was horrible what police</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.470" end="00:36:46.060" style="s2">law enforcement did to him and so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.960" end="00:36:48.790" style="s2">agree that how they handled this case</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.060" end="00:36:51.670" style="s2">was wrong and that it was like unjust</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.790" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">but it&#39;s also like this happens all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.670" end="00:36:56.020" style="s2">time this is very much how law</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:36:58.090" style="s2">enforcement operates they they catch</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.020" end="00:37:00.010" style="s2">people in lies and they convict them for</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.090" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">a procedural crime not actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.010" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">underlying crime like this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.450" end="00:37:05.260" style="s2">what they do in every case so it which I</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.270" style="s2">don&#39;t like which I&#39;m totally against I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.260" end="00:37:08.530" style="s2">would like to reform it but so right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.270" end="00:37:10.990" style="s2">I&#39;m agreeing with people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.530" end="00:37:12.250" style="s2">but they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re just taking</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.990" end="00:37:14.350" style="s2">it and not everyone I&#39;m sure some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.250" end="00:37:16.210" style="s2">them have a principled view but many of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.350" end="00:37:17.500" style="s2">them are just bugged about what happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.210" end="00:37:20.350" style="s2">to Michael Flynn because he&#39;s an ally of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.500" end="00:37:21.850" style="s2">Trump and in fact there will be no I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.350" end="00:37:24.609" style="s2">there pretty much guarantee there will</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.850" end="00:37:28.690" style="s2">be no vote to to change the standards</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.609" end="00:37:30.070" style="s2">the practices of how the FBI work in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.690" end="00:37:31.630" style="s2">long term there will there will not be</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.070" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">that reform because the criticism is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.630" end="00:37:33.519" style="s2">really only that they&#39;ve mistreated</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:35.649" style="s2">Trump people</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.519" end="00:37:37.029" style="s2">coming from the right when this and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.649" end="00:37:39.519" style="s2">the same principle is happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.029" end="00:37:40.749" style="s2">left liberal people usually you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.519" end="00:37:42.609" style="s2">more skeptical of law enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.749" end="00:37:44.259" style="s2">they&#39;ll say law enforcement and has all</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.609" end="00:37:45.880" style="s2">sorts of problems or problems on racial</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.259" end="00:37:47.349" style="s2">communities for instance no well now</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.880" end="00:37:48.939" style="s2">it&#39;s well we have to extent you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.349" end="00:37:51.399" style="s2">defend the good work</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.939" end="00:37:52.839" style="s2">the FBI was doing to hold the president</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.399" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">accountable or whatever nonsense they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.839" end="00:37:58.329" style="s2">saying so it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:38:00.279" style="s2">utterly I&#39;m its personality its tribal</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.329" end="00:38:02.979" style="s2">identity based and that&#39;s just not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.279" end="00:38:05.439" style="s2">way I operate yeah me either which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.979" end="00:38:08.589" style="s2">why I am able to roll into Barry</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.439" end="00:38:10.149" style="s2">heterodox circles and I tried to take a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.589" end="00:38:13.179" style="s2">principled stand and it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.149" end="00:38:15.640" style="s2">creates allies and bedfellows in weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.179" end="00:38:17.409" style="s2">places and you end up agreeing with some</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.640" end="00:38:19.630" style="s2">people on some things and and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.409" end="00:38:21.909" style="s2">disagreeing with them in the next breath</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.630" end="00:38:24.519" style="s2">but I think that the theme there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.909" end="00:38:27.699" style="s2">consistent which is pursuit of truth in</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.519" end="00:38:29.079" style="s2">an honest and compassionate way and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.699" end="00:38:31.449" style="s2">those are the kind of people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.079" end="00:38:34.869" style="s2">attracted to even if we have differing</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.449" end="00:38:37.179" style="s2">political outcomes or risk assessments</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.869" end="00:38:39.639" style="s2">of the same issues but you did bring up</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.179" end="00:38:41.499" style="s2">just now an interesting topic that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.639" end="00:38:44.259" style="s2">hadn&#39;t planned on getting into but it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.499" end="00:38:45.849" style="s2">worth getting your opinion on you point</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.259" end="00:38:50.039" style="s2">out the contradiction or some the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.849" end="00:38:52.869" style="s2">similarities of the critiques of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.039" end="00:38:55.689" style="s2">process by which law enforcement often</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.869" end="00:38:58.869" style="s2">goes about getting a conviction or a</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.689" end="00:39:01.389" style="s2">plea made me think of the current</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.869" end="00:39:03.189" style="s2">situation with Joe Biden now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.389" end="00:39:06.219" style="s2">talk a lot about Joe Biden because Joe</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.189" end="00:39:09.069" style="s2">Biden was one of the key pushers and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.219" end="00:39:14.039" style="s2">backers of the title 9 change that took</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.069" end="00:39:16.979" style="s2">place in 2011 13 14 and Joe Biden also</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.039" end="00:39:19.329" style="s2">you know but there&#39;s a me to advocate</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.979" end="00:39:20.859" style="s2">you know I&#39;m sure all of his friends</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.329" end="00:39:23.019" style="s2">were the ones that were tearing down</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.859" end="00:39:25.749" style="s2">Cavanaugh and the Supreme Court hearings</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.019" end="00:39:27.639" style="s2">and such you know trying to tear him</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.749" end="00:39:30.069" style="s2">down based on allegations that were</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.639" end="00:39:32.559" style="s2">uncorroborated that weren&#39;t reported</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.069" end="00:39:34.389" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t be confirmed in any way</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.559" end="00:39:36.279" style="s2">but at the time they were demanding the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.389" end="00:39:37.869" style="s2">Cavanaugh Burris recused himself or</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.279" end="00:39:40.989" style="s2">withdraw from the nomination they</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.869" end="00:39:43.989" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be approved etc etc and now</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.989" end="00:39:45.489" style="s2">we&#39;ve got Joe Biden who is in I call him</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.989" end="00:39:47.069" style="s2">the king of rape culture because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.489" end="00:39:48.779" style="s2">the one that really pushed us in</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.069" end="00:39:51.059" style="s2">to our culture through title 9 which</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.779" end="00:39:52.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about but now here he is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.059" end="00:39:54.599" style="s2">facing I don&#39;t know do you consider it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.920" end="00:39:55.949" style="s2">to be a credible allegation do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.599" end="00:40:00.269" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s something that should</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.949" end="00:40:02.670" style="s2">be investigated and if so how do I know</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.269" end="00:40:04.229" style="s2">the answer to this question but what how</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.670" end="00:40:05.640" style="s2">are people going to respond to this on</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.229" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">the left and then you know what does</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.640" end="00:40:11.219" style="s2">that mean for this general theme the me2</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:13.140" style="s2">theme and what does it mean for these</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.219" end="00:40:15.150" style="s2">general themes about believe all women</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.140" end="00:40:17.219" style="s2">etc etc how do you see that playing out</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.150" end="00:40:20.519" style="s2">sure so so obviously I&#39;m most interested</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.219" end="00:40:25.559" style="s2">in the accusation as a means of holding</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.519" end="00:40:28.140" style="s2">Joe Biden accountable for his bad he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.559" end="00:40:31.140" style="s2">at his bad at his pernicious advocacy of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.140" end="00:40:33.329" style="s2">standards that have that have heard</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.140" end="00:40:35.160" style="s2">people accused very much along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.329" end="00:40:37.589" style="s2">of that he&#39;s now accused of calling out</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.160" end="00:40:40.019" style="s2">his hypocrisy calling out what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.589" end="00:40:41.309" style="s2">really think was was at from at least</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.019" end="00:40:45.029" style="s2">from the start maybe not now at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.309" end="00:40:48.089" style="s2">beginning was unequal treatment for how</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.029" end="00:40:49.709" style="s2">the media handled this compared to how</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.089" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">they handled Christine Blakely Ford&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.709" end="00:40:52.920" style="s2">allegation against Brett Kavanaugh</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:55.739" style="s2">haven&#39;t you get out into all that as for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.920" end="00:40:57.239" style="s2">the accusation itself I don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.739" end="00:40:59.309" style="s2">with the term credible I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.239" end="00:41:02.039" style="s2">do you mean by credible is it does it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.309" end="00:41:04.410" style="s2">it could it have happened is it is it uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.039" end="00:41:07.499" style="s2">is it okay I guess you know if she said</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.410" end="00:41:10.049" style="s2">he Tran transformed into a dragon and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.499" end="00:41:11.579" style="s2">and breathes fire at me that would not</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.049" end="00:41:12.900" style="s2">be a credible accusation right because</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.579" end="00:41:14.579" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t have happened</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.900" end="00:41:18.920" style="s2">certainly what she described could have</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.579" end="00:41:22.680" style="s2">happened she has given I think a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.920" end="00:41:24.119" style="s2">rational reasonable person some reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:29.640" style="s2">to think it could have happened the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.119" end="00:41:30.900" style="s2">she said probably the best best its</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.640" end="00:41:32.369" style="s2">Missy it&#39;s not I&#39;m gonna say evidence</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.900" end="00:41:34.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s really not evidence because it</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.369" end="00:41:36.059" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work in a court it wouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.380" end="00:41:38.759" style="s2">you anywhere near establishing like a</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.759" end="00:41:43.410" style="s2">did it but that she told a friend a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.009" end="00:41:46.680" style="s2">neighbor to a two or three years after</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.410" end="00:41:48.239" style="s2">that and she she said that it was sexual</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.680" end="00:41:49.859" style="s2">assault and this neighbor has gone on</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.239" end="00:41:51.239" style="s2">the record and called this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.859" end="00:41:52.559" style="s2">that it was actually sexual assault and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.239" end="00:41:54.989" style="s2">this neighbor has said I&#39;m voting for</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.559" end="00:41:57.749" style="s2">Joe Biden anyway I hate Trump but yes I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.989" end="00:42:00.059" style="s2">she Tara Reid said this happened her and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.749" end="00:42:01.769" style="s2">I believe her but even that is not you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.059" end="00:42:04.410" style="s2">that&#39;s not contemporaneous evidence</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.069" end="00:42:14.789" style="s2">that a year ago when she was interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.900" end="00:42:16.109" style="s2">by The Washington Post she told them</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.789" end="00:42:17.969" style="s2">that there was a climate of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.109" end="00:42:20.969" style="s2">harassment in Joe Biden&#39;s office place</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.969" end="00:42:23.579" style="s2">and the you know her story is that she</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.969" end="00:42:26.789" style="s2">was mistreated she was harassed not by</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.579" end="00:42:28.920" style="s2">Biden himself but the workplace was was</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.789" end="00:42:30.239" style="s2">not friendly to women and she was</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:32.309" style="s2">uncomfortable and she was kind of forced</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.239" end="00:42:34.559" style="s2">out because of it and and that is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.309" end="00:42:37.049" style="s2">even more plausible story it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.559" end="00:42:39.709" style="s2">imagine the the office of a senator in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.049" end="00:42:41.939" style="s2">the in the early 90s or some time before</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.709" end="00:42:45.479" style="s2">operating that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.939" end="00:42:47.279" style="s2">but now she has a more you know a more</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.479" end="00:42:49.619" style="s2">salacious story that she was actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.279" end="00:42:53.819" style="s2">sexually assaulted by him in in no</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.619" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">uncertain terms and I and I I this again</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.819" end="00:42:59.519" style="s2">this is a long-ago accusation it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:01.349" style="s2">not it&#39;s not surprising that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.519" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">don&#39;t people don&#39;t remember hearing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.349" end="00:43:05.489" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:07.319" style="s2">Biden doesn&#39;t remember her I I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.489" end="00:43:09.239" style="s2">imagine if and again we&#39;re just trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.319" end="00:43:10.229" style="s2">this in the public square right because</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.239" end="00:43:12.299" style="s2">this is not we&#39;re not talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.229" end="00:43:13.499" style="s2">courtroom because you could not bring an</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.299" end="00:43:15.410" style="s2">accusation like this to a courtroom</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.499" end="00:43:17.849" style="s2">there&#39;s again there&#39;s no evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:19.829" style="s2">establish some guilt in that kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.849" end="00:43:22.199" style="s2">so then it just becomes you know do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.829" end="00:43:25.709" style="s2">if you&#39;re a Biden voter does this make</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.199" end="00:43:27.539" style="s2">you reconsider voting for him I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.709" end="00:43:29.819" style="s2">probably not going to vote for Biden but</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.539" end="00:43:31.619" style="s2">if I was I don&#39;t know I truly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.819" end="00:43:34.499" style="s2">think this would be enough to make me</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.619" end="00:43:36.509" style="s2">second-guess that I I think if this if</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.499" end="00:43:39.650" style="s2">this people don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.509" end="00:43:42.059" style="s2">to this for them to kind of overturn a</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.650" end="00:43:45.150" style="s2">general cultural presumption of</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.059" end="00:43:47.189" style="s2">innocence that makes sense to me even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.150" end="00:43:48.869" style="s2">she&#39;s you know she&#39;s I&#39;ve listened to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.189" end="00:43:52.739" style="s2">her be interviewed she&#39;s I think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.869" end="00:43:54.749" style="s2">empathetic I feel for her you don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.739" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">not when I&#39;m hearing her speak I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.749" end="00:43:58.349" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not hearing obvious red</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:43:59.670" style="s2">flags like oh she&#39;s crazy oh there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.349" end="00:44:01.170" style="s2">way this happened this is utterly</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.670" end="00:44:02.910" style="s2">unbelievable I don&#39;t get that impression</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.170" end="00:44:05.069" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t get that impression from</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.910" end="00:44:07.079" style="s2">Christine Blasi for it either so then</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.069" end="00:44:09.509" style="s2">you just you go to the other well who</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.079" end="00:44:11.249" style="s2">did she tell someone how well does she</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.509" end="00:44:13.170" style="s2">remember all that sort of things but</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.249" end="00:44:13.720" style="s2">honestly that the the frustrating truth</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.170" end="00:44:16.060" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.720" end="00:44:17.410" style="s2">accusations is that kind of it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.060" end="00:44:18.700" style="s2">gonna get you there to a position where</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.410" end="00:44:21.250" style="s2">you&#39;re reasonably comfortable you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.700" end="00:44:23.650" style="s2">what happened so and in that case</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.250" end="00:44:26.530" style="s2">defaulting to a general presumption of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.650" end="00:44:28.300" style="s2">innocence seems to me to be the way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.530" end="00:44:30.099" style="s2">go that&#39;s for the accusation itself but</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.300" end="00:44:32.859" style="s2">then I&#39;m happy to get into the all these</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.099" end="00:44:36.220" style="s2">sort of other yes the enormous relevance</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.859" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">this has to Joe Biden&#39;s history of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.220" end="00:44:42.010" style="s2">activism on undermining the safeguards</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:43.810" style="s2">of due process in a in a legal sense in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.010" end="00:44:47.260" style="s2">a formal sense and also just in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.810" end="00:44:50.020" style="s2">cultural sense yes undoubtedly he is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.260" end="00:44:53.340" style="s2">king I think of this of in spreading</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.020" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">this information in a in a structural</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.340" end="00:44:59.310" style="s2">federally enforced manner and I bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:03.250" style="s2">this up actually now thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.310" end="00:45:06.369" style="s2">Rolling Stone right so the Rolling Stone</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.250" end="00:45:09.430" style="s2">UVA rape hoax I remember when that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.369" end="00:45:12.700" style="s2">happened I was very involved and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.430" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">freshly involved in Twitter and this was</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.700" end="00:45:18.730" style="s2">a really big deal when it happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:21.010" style="s2">the the Rolling Stone rape hoax revealed</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.730" end="00:45:23.849" style="s2">to a lot of people was a red pilling</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.010" end="00:45:27.280" style="s2">moment as it were for a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.849" end="00:45:29.050" style="s2">because it laid bare so many of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.280" end="00:45:30.760" style="s2">issues that we were gonna end up talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.050" end="00:45:33.550" style="s2">about indefinitely and even all the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.760" end="00:45:36.430" style="s2">up until this very moment where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.550" end="00:45:38.980" style="s2">culture was primed and ready to just</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.430" end="00:45:42.099" style="s2">accept any accusation of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.980" end="00:45:44.920" style="s2">harassment rape or any other thing that</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.920" end="00:45:52.030" style="s2">campus that when this story came out and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">was like 2015 it was ridiculous it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.030" end="00:45:56.440" style="s2">crazy was over-the-top it was you know a</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:58.089" style="s2">group of guys they threw her down on a</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.270" end="00:46:14.520" style="s2">lapped it up because they were primed</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.010" end="00:46:17.770" style="s2">and ready to accept this narrative and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.520" end="00:46:20.830" style="s2">I&#39;m curious this is important to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.770" end="00:46:23.890" style="s2">because the that narrative arc I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.830" end="00:46:25.580" style="s2">where it&#39;s going right now and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.890" end="00:46:27.650" style="s2">wondering how it&#39;s going to play it</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.240" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2">heading at the time</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.440" end="00:46:46.970" style="s2">does it have better context now that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:48.650" style="s2">look back on it and put it into a series</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.970" end="00:46:51.740" style="s2">of events that sort of helped create</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.650" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2">this climate what value do you put on on</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:47.390" style="s2">suspect they have the same kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.670" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">utter faith in a in a in a victim or a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.390" end="00:48:51.589" style="s2">witness who seems like they they very</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">much might have been making the story up</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.589" end="00:48:57.140" style="s2">I I mean this is a crew joke but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:59.720" style="s2">say it I hope that she found the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.140" end="00:49:01.550" style="s2">like freeze to be a story that seems a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.720" end="00:49:03.349" style="s2">little doubtful if you dig into it like</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.550" end="00:49:05.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t don&#39;t generally believe that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.349" end="00:49:07.190" style="s2">those stories are made up or wrongful</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.420" end="00:49:09.020" style="s2">accusations but if you read this one you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.190" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">might think they generally are just from</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.020" end="00:49:12.829" style="s2">looking at the work she had done there</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:14.270" style="s2">so she had this history that she brought</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.829" end="00:49:16.700" style="s2">to this issue of just an utter</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.270" end="00:49:18.740" style="s2">conviction that a victim telling their</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.700" end="00:49:20.390" style="s2">story is telling the truth and if</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.740" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">they&#39;re uncomfortable or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.390" end="00:49:23.990" style="s2">unwilling or they&#39;re hesitant or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:26.030" style="s2">telling you different things that is all</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.990" end="00:49:27.380" style="s2">that makes it more likely that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.030" end="00:49:30.200" style="s2">telling the truth that&#39;s the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.380" end="00:49:31.609" style="s2">that would we&#39;ve been told that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.200" end="00:49:35.180" style="s2">part of the training actually in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.609" end="00:49:36.980" style="s2">of title 9 materials that well a victim</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.180" end="00:49:39.020" style="s2">has all of these problems that in any</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.980" end="00:49:40.970" style="s2">other context would make you doubt them</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.020" end="00:49:42.910" style="s2">that probably means they actually were</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.970" end="00:49:47.300" style="s2">victimized and their suffering trauma</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.910" end="00:49:49.869" style="s2">and just the just the the inability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.300" end="00:49:52.040" style="s2">question her or to go through normal</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.869" end="00:49:53.500" style="s2">processes because honestly you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.040" end="00:49:55.339" style="s2">should have the story should have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.500" end="00:49:57.020" style="s2">never it would never would have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.339" end="00:49:59.810" style="s2">published under normal circumstances an</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.020" end="00:50:02.990" style="s2">editor would have said okay well but did</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.810" end="00:50:05.150" style="s2">you reach out to you know XYZ people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.990" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">are named in the story to get their</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.150" end="00:50:09.950" style="s2">perspective and of course Sabrina didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:12.770" style="s2">because Jackie wouldn&#39;t allow her to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.950" end="00:50:16.040" style="s2">Jackie being the the victim in the story</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.770" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">through the story&#39;s name but the editors</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.040" end="00:50:18.560" style="s2">just went along with it because they</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:19.700" style="s2">just sounded like this seemed like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.560" end="00:50:22.670" style="s2">great story</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.700" end="00:50:24.140" style="s2">huge story important and again fitting</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.670" end="00:50:27.050" style="s2">the narrative of how we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.140" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">treat treat victims then obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.050" end="00:50:34.369" style="s2">all falls apart Jackie she so she never</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:36.050" style="s2">divulges to Sabrina who the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.369" end="00:50:38.089" style="s2">person who attacked her who orchestrated</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.050" end="00:50:40.670" style="s2">this horrific gang rape even though</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.089" end="00:50:42.260" style="s2">according to the story Jackie knew who</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.670" end="00:50:44.510" style="s2">it was she was on a date with this guy</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.260" end="00:50:45.800" style="s2">so she knew who he was so that was a I</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.510" end="00:50:47.260" style="s2">mean that was one of the red flags right</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.800" end="00:50:50.270" style="s2">well I mean there&#39;s so many red flags</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.260" end="00:50:52.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve covered I&#39;ve covered I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.270" end="00:50:53.660" style="s2">about so many sexual assaults on college</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.280" end="00:50:56.150" style="s2">campuses</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.660" end="00:50:58.430" style="s2">I I could believe there would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.150" end="00:51:00.350" style="s2">certainly there have been gang sexual</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.430" end="00:51:02.510" style="s2">assaults and there have also been</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.350" end="00:51:05.360" style="s2">premeditated sexual assaults but I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.510" end="00:51:08.830" style="s2">having trouble picturing or thinking at</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.360" end="00:51:12.530" style="s2">all likely a gang sexual assault</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.830" end="00:51:15.140" style="s2">involving multiple so multiple people</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.530" end="00:51:16.580" style="s2">responsible for it that was planned out</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.140" end="00:51:17.870" style="s2">in advance which was what the story was</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.580" end="00:51:20.930" style="s2">suggesting that this was like some</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.870" end="00:51:22.790" style="s2">initiation right and and the victim was</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.930" end="00:51:24.380" style="s2">not incapacitated through drugs or</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.790" end="00:51:25.850" style="s2">alcohol which is what it usually occurs</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.380" end="00:51:27.590" style="s2">even in sexual assaults that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.850" end="00:51:30.290" style="s2">actually taking place because you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.590" end="00:51:31.520" style="s2">to have some the victim has to there has</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.290" end="00:51:33.410" style="s2">to be some haziness so that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.520" end="00:51:36.200" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t immediately go to the cops so</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.410" end="00:51:38.150" style="s2">it was just that was quite a pill to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.200" end="00:51:40.220" style="s2">swallow as it turned out that should</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.150" end="00:51:42.470" style="s2">have given the writer the editors the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.220" end="00:51:44.030" style="s2">fact-checkers pause because the person</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.470" end="00:51:45.740" style="s2">who then finally afterwards she said</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.030" end="00:51:48.470" style="s2">okay well this is who did it well he did</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.740" end="00:51:50.210" style="s2">not exist messages sent from him to her</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.470" end="00:51:52.580" style="s2">friends were actually sent by Jay whose</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.210" end="00:51:55.370" style="s2">elaborate catfishing type thing which by</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.580" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">the way is not actually common yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.370" end="00:52:00.740" style="s2">stands out about the story is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:03.140" style="s2">Jackie was a sort of uniquely deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.740" end="00:52:05.000" style="s2">person even in this sort of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.140" end="00:52:07.730" style="s2">sexual misconduct disputes that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.000" end="00:52:09.260" style="s2">generally cover it&#39;s generally you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.730" end="00:52:10.730" style="s2">we both got drunk here&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.260" end="00:52:14.510" style="s2">happened here&#39;s what you think happened</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.730" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">to like entirely fabricate a persona</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.510" end="00:52:19.100" style="s2">send messages from that person to your</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:21.830" style="s2">friends I mean that that&#39;s going to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.100" end="00:52:23.060" style="s2">level that that you have to there has to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.830" end="00:52:23.960" style="s2">be something very wrong with you to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.060" end="00:52:26.450" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.960" end="00:52:28.460" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting that that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.450" end="00:52:32.180" style="s2">the rolling stone got ensnared by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.460" end="00:52:34.940" style="s2">uncommon case of the truly motivated you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.180" end="00:52:36.890" style="s2">know crazy delusional person when</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.940" end="00:52:38.750" style="s2">actually the cases that are more common</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.890" end="00:52:41.660" style="s2">that I write about you know fall in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.750" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">great much much greater zone of where</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.660" end="00:52:45.740" style="s2">maybe the victim and sent it in the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:47.750" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t consent now or may you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.740" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s they&#39;re they&#39;re harder cases this</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.750" end="00:52:50.780" style="s2">one was an easy case which is maybe why</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.810" style="s2">it turned out to be just utterly</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.780" end="00:52:57.080" style="s2">obviously false yeah it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.810" end="00:52:58.460" style="s2">fascinating that this case supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.080" end="00:53:00.680" style="s2">had a bunch of evidence that you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.460" end="00:53:02.180" style="s2">you know point to or at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.680" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">article they claimed to but then as</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.180" end="00:53:07.549" style="s2">you&#39;re saying most of most of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">to harassment or assault cases or now I</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.549" end="00:53:12.019" style="s2">don&#39;t I can&#39;t say most many of them on</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.920" end="00:53:14.390" style="s2">campus there would be no evidence anyway</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.019" end="00:53:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of recollection and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.390" end="00:53:19.940" style="s2">of people&#39;s perspectives which</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.510" end="00:53:22.190" style="s2">perspective can change your feeling</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.940" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">around consent can change from one day</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.190" end="00:53:26.390" style="s2">to the next which is another reason why</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:29.809" style="s2">the sexual assault stuff gets so</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.390" end="00:53:31.880" style="s2">complicated you did raise a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.809" end="00:53:33.230" style="s2">good points are a number of good points</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.880" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">but I want to talk about a couple on</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.230" end="00:53:40.779" style="s2">that last a little bit where the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:45.369" style="s2">Rolling Stone case highlights the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.779" end="00:53:50.450" style="s2">very powerful yet sort of duplicitous</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.369" end="00:53:53.510" style="s2">pillars of the intersectional combo with</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.450" end="00:53:55.670" style="s2">post-modernism and and into social</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.510" end="00:53:58.309" style="s2">justice and critical theories that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.670" end="00:54:00.200" style="s2">know there&#39;s only one truth and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.309" end="00:54:03.049" style="s2">truth comes from the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.200" end="00:54:04.760" style="s2">speaking it and you can&#39;t assail that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.049" end="00:54:07.099" style="s2">you can&#39;t tear it down you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.760" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">challenge it it is it is actually in</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.099" end="00:54:13.490" style="s2">their worldview the only definition of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:14.779" style="s2">truth is your personal perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.490" end="00:54:16.759" style="s2">it can&#39;t be challenged and you call they</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.779" end="00:54:18.890" style="s2">call the standpoint theory so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.759" end="00:54:20.299" style="s2">interesting to me how these philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.890" end="00:54:22.789" style="s2">and theories and have turned into</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.299" end="00:54:25.789" style="s2">application but they&#39;ve also developed a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.789" end="00:54:28.279" style="s2">number of tools and soar branches off of</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.789" end="00:54:30.410" style="s2">their theories that make critique of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.279" end="00:54:33.319" style="s2">impossible that make challenging it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.410" end="00:54:36.140" style="s2">impossible and you can you can feel what</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.319" end="00:54:38.569" style="s2">that means when it comes to a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.140" end="00:54:41.299" style="s2">assault or a rape case like the Rolling</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.569" end="00:54:43.849" style="s2">Stone hoax because you can even you</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.299" end="00:54:46.130" style="s2">can&#39;t even challenge the accuser without</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.130" end="00:54:50.359" style="s2">of reality or truth and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.190" end="00:54:51.799" style="s2">trying to you know it&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.359" end="00:54:54.829" style="s2">questioning you&#39;re just trying to impose</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.799" end="00:54:57.349" style="s2">your your sense of your dominating sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.829" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">and your power upon upon the oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.349" end="00:55:02.210" style="s2">here and it&#39;s just another reason why</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:06.500" style="s2">that that Rolling Stone thing just stood</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.210" end="00:55:08.509" style="s2">out so bright and loud and and red pill</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.500" end="00:55:10.910" style="s2">the number of us on the media as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.509" end="00:55:13.000" style="s2">right because Rolling Stone that was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.910" end="00:55:14.860" style="s2">trusted news source and and there</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.000" end="00:55:18.970" style="s2">they were like pushing some of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.860" end="00:55:21.340" style="s2">kind of fake hoaxes salaciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.970" end="00:55:24.610" style="s2">you could possibly push on this this</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.340" end="00:55:27.460" style="s2">this environment of rape culture and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.610" end="00:55:30.120" style="s2">fact that you know the the Straits is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.460" end="00:55:33.250" style="s2">hetero white male is the this</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.120" end="00:55:35.950" style="s2">promulgating rape culture where they say</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.250" end="00:55:37.750" style="s2">one in four one in five women on campus</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:39.550" style="s2">was gonna be raped</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.750" end="00:55:41.710" style="s2">now that&#39;s something that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.550" end="00:55:45.210" style="s2">dig into with you because the the rape</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.710" end="00:55:49.930" style="s2">culture and the rape culture stats</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.210" end="00:55:52.290" style="s2">became a catalyst for the title nine</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.930" end="00:55:54.730" style="s2">modifications which operationalize</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.290" end="00:55:56.020" style="s2">intersectionality became an operating</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.730" end="00:55:58.180" style="s2">system as you say for our</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.020" end="00:56:00.490" style="s2">intersectionality which then was how it</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.180" end="00:56:03.580" style="s2">was rolled out across the country and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.490" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">institutionalized let&#39;s talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.580" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">bit about the rape stats and rape</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:11.710" style="s2">culture I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve done a number a</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:13.180" style="s2">deep dive investigation on this and if</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.710" end="00:56:15.130" style="s2">you could just give us a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.180" end="00:56:17.650" style="s2">intro on that because it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.130" end="00:56:19.450" style="s2">important about how this data came to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.650" end="00:56:22.330" style="s2">even and how it made it to the White</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.450" end="00:56:24.430" style="s2">House so so Bobby is it true do one in</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.330" end="00:56:27.850" style="s2">four women on campus get raped at some</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.430" end="00:56:29.230" style="s2">point I don&#39;t think so because there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.850" end="00:56:31.650" style="s2">there are studies you could point to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.230" end="00:56:34.750" style="s2">that it propor purported to find that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.650" end="00:56:37.180" style="s2">finding the problem immediately becomes</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.750" end="00:56:39.010" style="s2">how are we defining our terms you hear</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.180" end="00:56:41.170" style="s2">it&#39;s one in four and it&#39;s rape but then</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.010" end="00:56:43.030" style="s2">if you look at you know what what was</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.170" end="00:56:44.740" style="s2">the question actually asked the often</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.030" end="00:56:47.230" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that the person surveyed</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.740" end="00:56:49.360" style="s2">would did not identify themselves as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.230" end="00:56:50.650" style="s2">victim of rape but maybe you asked them</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.360" end="00:56:53.620" style="s2">well have you ever been in a position</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.650" end="00:56:55.300" style="s2">where you felt you had been at you&#39;d had</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.620" end="00:56:56.410" style="s2">more to drink that he wanted to have and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.300" end="00:56:58.120" style="s2">you were put in a position to feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.410" end="00:56:59.980" style="s2">sexually uncomfortable some broader</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.120" end="00:57:02.470" style="s2">language like that well guess what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.980" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">of people say yeah I mean under that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.470" end="00:57:05.230" style="s2">language you might find them more people</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.870" style="s2">than one in five we&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.230" end="00:57:10.420" style="s2">experience there starts to be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.870" end="00:57:12.130" style="s2">slipperiness or an identifying or</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.420" end="00:57:13.750" style="s2">asserting on behalf of people that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.130" end="00:57:15.820" style="s2">are victims of something that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.750" end="00:57:17.260" style="s2">actually don&#39;t see themselves of then</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.820" end="00:57:19.120" style="s2">you then you have other surveys that</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.260" end="00:57:21.010" style="s2">find actually women who are not in</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.120" end="00:57:23.260" style="s2">college are at much greater risk of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.010" end="00:57:26.030" style="s2">sexual misconduct that women who are in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.260" end="00:57:27.620" style="s2">college or the women are of college age</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.030" end="00:57:29.240" style="s2">because then you know you meet with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.620" end="00:57:31.490" style="s2">reality of crime statistics where the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.240" end="00:57:34.310" style="s2">you know most victims of anything be it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.490" end="00:57:36.110" style="s2">assault robbery etcetera etc are low</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.310" end="00:57:38.180" style="s2">income people it&#39;s in the household</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.110" end="00:57:40.700" style="s2">people and bad marriages or living in</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.180" end="00:57:42.200" style="s2">bad environments those those are victims</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.700" end="00:57:45.470" style="s2">those are women who actually tend not to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.200" end="00:57:48.500" style="s2">be in college so there&#39;s like a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.470" end="00:57:51.230" style="s2">like a a undue focus on the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.500" end="00:57:52.220" style="s2">narrow problems of college campuses when</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.230" end="00:57:54.080" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a lot of reason to</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.220" end="00:57:55.940" style="s2">think you&#39;d probably probably the when</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.080" end="00:57:58.190" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a population of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.940" end="00:58:00.380" style="s2">people who are a variant risk of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.190" end="00:58:02.120" style="s2">violence you would not be looking at you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.380" end="00:58:04.610" style="s2">know the undergraduates of like Oberlin</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.120" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">or Columbia or something there are all</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.610" end="00:58:08.450" style="s2">but you know there are this is a hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.650" end="00:58:10.610" style="s2">statistic to pin down there are there</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.450" end="00:58:11.690" style="s2">are some studies that have purported to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.610" end="00:58:13.220" style="s2">find it and then there are a couple</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.690" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">other statistics that are very important</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.220" end="00:58:16.370" style="s2">for this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:18.350" style="s2">one being the the false report rate</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.370" end="00:58:21.230" style="s2">which you hear a lot well how it will</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.350" end="00:58:23.210" style="s2">aren&#39;t you know how many sexual reported</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.230" end="00:58:25.790" style="s2">sexual assaults are false reports and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.210" end="00:58:28.460" style="s2">there you have everything from 40% of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.790" end="00:58:30.710" style="s2">them to like 2% of them which is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.460" end="00:58:32.630" style="s2">difference is it is it that that like</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.710" end="00:58:34.310" style="s2">nearly half of these kinds of reports</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.630" end="00:58:36.440" style="s2">are false or is it that that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.310" end="00:58:38.390" style="s2">almost never false reports lower than</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.440" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">any other category of thing being</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.390" end="00:58:42.020" style="s2">falsely reported and of course here you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:43.550" style="s2">find out that we have no idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.020" end="00:58:46.310" style="s2">statistics used arrive at this are just</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.550" end="00:58:47.450" style="s2">useless for one thing you know those are</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.310" end="00:58:49.850" style="s2">the more rigorous ones that are looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.450" end="00:58:52.250" style="s2">at police it&#39;s reported to police</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.850" end="00:58:53.690" style="s2">well it&#39;s only going to be labeled as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.250" end="00:58:55.970" style="s2">false report if the police would like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.690" end="00:58:57.950" style="s2">explicitly able to find evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.970" end="00:58:59.810" style="s2">they knew for sure it was false which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.950" end="00:59:01.310" style="s2">not which is not the length that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.810" end="00:59:03.380" style="s2">going to when they&#39;re deciding whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.310" end="00:59:06.110" style="s2">this could be prosecuted right this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.380" end="00:59:10.610" style="s2">like explicitly determining it to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.110" end="00:59:13.130" style="s2">false is a whole nother another level so</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.610" end="00:59:15.050" style="s2">this isn&#39;t so so that&#39;s statistic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.130" end="00:59:17.180" style="s2">finding like a low false report rate but</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.050" end="00:59:18.140" style="s2">but it but probably it&#39;s true do</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.180" end="00:59:19.610" style="s2">something you know how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.140" end="00:59:21.470" style="s2">actually going out and filing false</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.610" end="00:59:23.930" style="s2">police reports well I tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.470" end="00:59:25.160" style="s2">that&#39;s probably low again that&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.930" end="00:59:27.290" style="s2">have to think about what&#39;s the level of</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.160" end="00:59:28.910" style="s2">deception involved that seems extreme I</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.290" end="00:59:30.200" style="s2">don&#39;t think that happens a lot but of</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.910" end="00:59:31.670" style="s2">course I&#39;m not talking about going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.200" end="00:59:33.620" style="s2">the police and all these scenarios at</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.670" end="00:59:35.060" style="s2">Christine Boise Ford didn&#39;t go to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.620" end="00:59:36.710" style="s2">police Tara Reid didn&#39;t go to the police</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.060" end="00:59:38.780" style="s2">these kinds of accusations by the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.710" end="00:59:39.770" style="s2">are just kind of general did you say</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.780" end="00:59:41.690" style="s2">something that was</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.770" end="00:59:43.910" style="s2">true or not and of course we have no way</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.690" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">to determine what&#39;s the how often people</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.910" end="00:59:48.110" style="s2">exaggerate or mischaracterize things</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.780" style="s2">that happen to them recently or a long</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.110" end="00:59:52.730" style="s2">time ago etc so there we just we have no</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.780" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">idea and anyone who sort of asserts that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.730" end="00:59:57.050" style="s2">well we we should think X because this</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="00:59:59.360" style="s2">is how many reports we know to be false</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.050" end="01:00:01.820" style="s2">this just you&#39;re just using statistics</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.360" end="01:00:03.050" style="s2">that are not meaningful at all and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.820" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">of course and then the other very</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.050" end="01:00:07.190" style="s2">important statistic for talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">title 9 adjudication is the serial</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.190" end="01:00:10.670" style="s2">predator statistic which I actually I</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:12.950" style="s2">did the most work on where was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.670" end="01:00:14.690" style="s2">just me looking at that it became very</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.950" end="01:00:18.920" style="s2">popular in activist circles to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.690" end="01:00:21.020" style="s2">that the that most campus rapists are</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.920" end="01:00:22.700" style="s2">committing on average I think maybe six</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.020" end="01:00:23.690" style="s2">rapes there they&#39;re repeat offenders</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.700" end="01:00:25.940" style="s2">there are people who commit sexual</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.690" end="01:00:30.380" style="s2">assault over and over again so the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.940" end="01:00:31.970" style="s2">the the the the reason that matters is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.380" end="01:00:33.590" style="s2">that so then if you someone if someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.970" end="01:00:35.120" style="s2">is accused and you think they might</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.590" end="01:00:36.740" style="s2">you&#39;re not just it&#39;s not just that they</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.120" end="01:00:38.540" style="s2">may be committed sexual assault it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.740" end="01:00:39.890" style="s2">that they if they did commit sexual</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.540" end="01:00:41.390" style="s2">assault they probably did it a lot so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.890" end="01:00:42.530" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to get rid of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.390" end="01:00:44.330" style="s2">to ban them from campus</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.530" end="01:00:45.950" style="s2">perhaps the argument for suspending due</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.330" end="01:00:47.990" style="s2">process or have something less than due</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.950" end="01:00:49.700" style="s2">process is more compelling because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.990" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">science shows that these people do this</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.700" end="01:00:52.880" style="s2">over and over and over again well of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:56.060" style="s2">course the study and it was just one</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.880" end="01:00:57.890" style="s2">study really that that launched that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.060" end="01:01:00.020" style="s2">wave of thinking it&#39;s by a psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.890" end="01:01:02.150" style="s2">named David David Lee sac I looked at it</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.020" end="01:01:04.100" style="s2">in great depth with a a co-author</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.150" end="01:01:06.890" style="s2">actually a college administrator who</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.100" end="01:01:09.020" style="s2">came to who brought this to my attention</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.890" end="01:01:10.580" style="s2">and did a lot of writing on it as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.020" end="01:01:12.860" style="s2">she actually talked to Lisa briefly</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.580" end="01:01:16.520" style="s2">before he hung up hung up the phone on</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.860" end="01:01:19.700" style="s2">her hey it turned out his research was I</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.520" end="01:01:21.770" style="s2">was had nothing to do with the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.700" end="01:01:23.930" style="s2">of campus sexual assault</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.770" end="01:01:26.980" style="s2">except in a very abstract way he was</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.930" end="01:01:29.840" style="s2">surveying people at a commuter school in</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.980" end="01:01:31.460" style="s2">Massachusetts who just happened to walk</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.840" end="01:01:33.230" style="s2">with Randy he was not doing this this</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.460" end="01:01:35.420" style="s2">was research his graduate students were</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.230" end="01:01:38.440" style="s2">doing for unrelated work long story</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.420" end="01:01:40.850" style="s2">short these were people describing</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.440" end="01:01:42.830" style="s2">violent acts that they may have</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.850" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">committed probably against domestic</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.830" end="01:01:47.150" style="s2">partnerships or their children or</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:49.550" style="s2">children of their partners not in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.150" end="01:01:51.410" style="s2">campus setting not student on student</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.550" end="01:01:53.060" style="s2">violence not at all the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.410" end="01:01:55.130" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.060" end="01:01:57.590" style="s2">what is happening in the dormitories at</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.130" end="01:01:59.930" style="s2">at the State University or the liberal</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.590" end="01:02:02.750" style="s2">arts college or whatever and but that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.930" end="01:02:05.780" style="s2">research has been it was generalized to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.750" end="01:02:07.790" style="s2">the campus population to a degree</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.780" end="01:02:09.170" style="s2">it&#39;s almost unfathomable is you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.790" end="01:02:11.390" style="s2">this is a person whose guidance has gone</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.170" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">into whose opinions have gone have</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.390" end="01:02:17.270" style="s2">informed title nine Commission&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.240" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">whose advice was taken by by prominent</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.270" end="01:02:20.930" style="s2">politicians who appears in the hunting</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:22.670" style="s2">ground which is the the famous</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.930" end="01:02:24.170" style="s2">documentary film about the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.670" end="01:02:27.560" style="s2">sexual violence on college campuses and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.170" end="01:02:31.430" style="s2">it really the the picture that emerges</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.560" end="01:02:33.290" style="s2">from that data is very is not well</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.430" end="01:02:34.940" style="s2">correlated with the actual problem so</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.290" end="01:02:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s so so the statistics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.940" end="01:02:39.770" style="s2">certainly a source of harm but then a</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.280" end="01:02:42.320" style="s2">which I and I think will probably turn</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.770" end="01:02:43.640" style="s2">to this now the the kind of most we</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.320" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">talking about the cultural issues and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.640" end="01:02:47.570" style="s2">the and the statistics the science of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">course the explicit policy changes</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.570" end="01:02:52.760" style="s2">enacted by policymakers and government</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:53.810" style="s2">what was the is the immediate most you</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.760" end="01:02:55.130" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have too well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.810" end="01:02:56.900" style="s2">nebulous connection between this</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.130" end="01:02:58.340" style="s2">cultural factor in this of course the</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.900" end="01:03:01.130" style="s2">government&#39;s saying you have to do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.340" end="01:03:04.010" style="s2">this way is the most direct reason that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.130" end="01:03:06.740" style="s2">it became this situation became so dire</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.010" end="01:03:09.590" style="s2">so quickly on college campuses yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.740" end="01:03:11.090" style="s2">fascinating to me to see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.590" end="01:03:12.830" style="s2">when people start digging down on these</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.090" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">statistics so the one on four number</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.830" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">that was something that I remember being</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:18.140" style="s2">beaten over my head with it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:20.060" style="s2">everywhere rape culture rape culture</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.140" end="01:03:22.490" style="s2">rape culture but you start to dig into</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.060" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">it you start to look at the survey you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.490" end="01:03:27.560" style="s2">realized that the person who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:29.780" style="s2">who&#39;s recording the survey starts</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.560" end="01:03:31.820" style="s2">assigning whether the person was</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.780" end="01:03:33.530" style="s2">assaulted or not even if the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.820" end="01:03:35.780" style="s2">respondent to the survey didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.530" end="01:03:38.530" style="s2">that they were they expand the terms</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.780" end="01:03:42.020" style="s2">used to define sexual assault or sexual</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.530" end="01:03:43.640" style="s2">sexual violence there&#39;s there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.020" end="01:03:45.620" style="s2">number of ways that the numbers get</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.640" end="01:03:48.020" style="s2">twisted and the studies turn out to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.620" end="01:03:51.260" style="s2">terrible and even some of the studies</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.020" end="01:03:54.770" style="s2">that were most regularly cited said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.260" end="01:03:57.230" style="s2">right in them by the authors even this</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.770" end="01:03:59.630" style="s2">data is not nationally representative</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.230" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">and it shouldn&#39;t be extrapolated across</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.630" end="01:04:04.220" style="s2">they all of our universities and even in</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:07.010" style="s2">the face of</p>

<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:20.180" style="s2">which was that men are bad</p>

<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:08.690" style="s2">these statistics and then do I have this</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.530" end="01:06:12.740" style="s2">right I&#39;m pretty sure I believe that Joe</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.690" end="01:06:13.700" style="s2">Biden then became the the primary force</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.010" end="01:16:23.740" style="s2">worth sharing an in contextual here when</p>

<p begin="01:19:17.780" end="01:19:23.989" style="s2">think has happened is they have hired a</p>

<p begin="01:20:18.980" end="01:20:23.870" style="s2">certainly it looks that way you know I</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.469" end="01:20:25.910" style="s2">have friends I know people inside the</p>

<p begin="01:20:47.060" end="01:20:52.610" style="s2">what the vocal sort of young activists</p>

<p begin="01:28:18.159" end="01:28:23.889" style="s2">principles and it&#39;s clear organizations</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.739" end="01:28:25.989" style="s2">like move on sadly it seems as though</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.889" end="01:28:29.380" style="s2">they cou is moving in the same way</p>

<p begin="01:29:01.300" end="01:29:08.829" style="s2">amazing at revealing hypocrisy and and</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.439" end="01:29:11.739" style="s2">an agendas and and the motivation behind</p>

<p begin="01:29:17.979" end="01:29:22.749" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of why we feel this</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.229" end="01:29:24.999" style="s2">conflict and dissonance and in this</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.749" end="01:29:27.519" style="s2">unease and it&#39;s also why when you start</p>

<p begin="01:29:27.519" end="01:29:32.139" style="s2">positions like these that they tend to</p>

<p begin="01:29:46.959" end="01:29:52.449" style="s2">all based on quicksand and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.570" end="01:29:54.610" style="s2">the the country really felt that with</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.449" end="01:29:57.519" style="s2">title 9 I really felt that with the Dear</p>

<p begin="01:33:34.450" end="01:33:37.360" style="s2">again this is this is actually not the</p>

<p begin="01:33:37.360" end="01:33:42.190" style="s2">of the bureaucrats processing it on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.970" end="01:33:44.920" style="s2">other on the other end but the guidance</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.190" end="01:33:48.550" style="s2">itself is also just fundamentally flawed</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.920" end="01:33:51.250" style="s2">in the procedures it is requiring for</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.550" end="01:33:53.410" style="s2">adjudication and you have you know you</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.250" end="01:33:57.190" style="s2">have universities moving to just utterly</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.410" end="01:33:58.600" style="s2">reprehensible policies not having you</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.190" end="01:34:01.750" style="s2">know the guidance is recommending</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.600" end="01:34:03.450" style="s2">against cross examination it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.750" end="01:34:07.090" style="s2">is not saying there has to be lawyers</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.450" end="01:34:09.910" style="s2">it&#39;s saying if if the if the accused can</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.090" end="01:34:12.070" style="s2">appeal then the the the accuser has to</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.910" end="01:34:13.570" style="s2">be able to appeal its saying and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.070" end="01:34:16.290" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s you know it&#39;s set it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.570" end="01:34:18.940" style="s2">its proponents it makes a settlement</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.290" end="01:34:20.560" style="s2">document with with individual schools</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.940" end="01:34:21.850" style="s2">and colleges first it you know it will</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.560" end="01:34:24.220" style="s2">tell you oh we&#39;re investigating you for</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.850" end="01:34:25.630" style="s2">violating title nine and then it will</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.220" end="01:34:26.800" style="s2">later produce a document saying okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.630" end="01:34:28.900" style="s2">here&#39;s everything you were doing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.800" end="01:34:31.270" style="s2">the first one was the one for the</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.900" end="01:34:32.530" style="s2">University of Montana which is the deer</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.270" end="01:34:33.480" style="s2">which then it is supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.530" end="01:34:34.980" style="s2">guidance for every</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.480" end="01:34:36.750" style="s2">but then Adela so does a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.980" end="01:34:39.720" style="s2">specialized guidance for individual</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.750" end="01:34:41.130" style="s2">schools and universities I read one of</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.720" end="01:34:43.050" style="s2">these documents where it said well in</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.130" end="01:34:44.700" style="s2">your in your title nine procedures this</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.050" end="01:34:46.770" style="s2">is the government talking to the school</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.700" end="01:34:50.220" style="s2">it says we&#39;re gonna do like what a</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.770" end="01:34:51.990" style="s2">reasonable person would think well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.220" end="01:34:53.970" style="s2">gonna advise you against reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.990" end="01:34:56.400" style="s2">reasonable reason reasonableness</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.970" end="01:34:57.990" style="s2">reasonableness that&#39;s that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.400" end="01:34:59.250" style="s2">standard we&#39;re going for I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.990" end="01:35:01.170" style="s2">the government telling them a reason</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.250" end="01:35:02.880" style="s2">maybe this is me as an editor for a</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.170" end="01:35:05.720" style="s2">magazine called reason but I find that</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.880" end="01:35:08.490" style="s2">objection one problem with that yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.720" end="01:35:10.710" style="s2">this is that is insane do you do you</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.490" end="01:35:12.810" style="s2">think though I mean just to summarize</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.710" end="01:35:14.340" style="s2">right like all of a sudden you can get</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.810" end="01:35:16.050" style="s2">kicked out of school for making an</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.340" end="01:35:17.880" style="s2">offhanded comment basically you no</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.050" end="01:35:20.810" style="s2">longer have to clear a hurdle being</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.880" end="01:35:24.450" style="s2">consistent persistent and and and</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.810" end="01:35:26.580" style="s2">prohibiting the quote victim from</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.450" end="01:35:28.080" style="s2">obtaining their college education which</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.580" end="01:35:30.680" style="s2">was what the whole theory was based on</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.080" end="01:35:33.150" style="s2">in the first place the level of</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.680" end="01:35:34.980" style="s2">evidentiary standard was lowered to</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.150" end="01:35:36.810" style="s2">preponderance of the evidence which is</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.980" end="01:35:40.070" style="s2">after you put in in the book fifty</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.810" end="01:35:43.170" style="s2">percent plus a feather but there was a</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.070" end="01:35:45.030" style="s2">sort of the criminalization as a war of</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.170" end="01:35:46.700" style="s2">things that had been ordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.030" end="01:35:51.030" style="s2">protected under the First Amendment</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.700" end="01:35:52.830" style="s2">there was no ability for the accused to</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.030" end="01:35:55.080" style="s2">conduct an investigation or</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.830" end="01:35:57.450" style="s2">cross-examination or face their accuser</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.080" end="01:36:01.320" style="s2">all things that we hold to be very dear</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.450" end="01:36:02.910" style="s2">and essential parts of due process all</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.320" end="01:36:04.290" style="s2">these things start spreading out all</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.910" end="01:36:06.510" style="s2">over the country and you said though</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.290" end="01:36:09.120" style="s2">that you the bureaucrats took things one</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.510" end="01:36:12.270" style="s2">step further I think that they were</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.120" end="01:36:14.460" style="s2">probably gleefully ready and excited to</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.270" end="01:36:18.120" style="s2">do that people that work in title nine</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.460" end="01:36:20.610" style="s2">offices in the universities probably not</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.120" end="01:36:22.700" style="s2">going to be right wing probably going to</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.610" end="01:36:24.990" style="s2">be libertarian probably already</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.700" end="01:36:26.190" style="s2">indoctrinated into gender studies and</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.990" end="01:36:28.200" style="s2">critical theory that&#39;s why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.190" end="01:36:30.870" style="s2">working in title nine so all these</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.200" end="01:36:33.690" style="s2">things work together to build a climate</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.870" end="01:36:36.420" style="s2">and this is the part where I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.690" end="01:36:38.490" style="s2">really important because it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.420" end="01:36:41.580" style="s2">like in the old days where when you went</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.490" end="01:36:44.220" style="s2">to school you got indoctrinated or</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.580" end="01:36:46.520" style="s2">brainwashed as it were by professors in</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.220" end="01:36:47.840" style="s2">your class on a specific subject they</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.520" end="01:36:50.060" style="s2">taught you what they wanted to you to</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.840" end="01:36:52.100" style="s2">know and it was up to you to be critical</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.060" end="01:36:56.030" style="s2">or to accept it or not</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.100" end="01:36:59.450" style="s2">but now the indoctrination process</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.030" end="01:37:01.910" style="s2">begins in orientation it is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.450" end="01:37:03.860" style="s2">culture on the campus it&#39;s plastered all</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.910" end="01:37:07.910" style="s2">over the walls there&#39;s offices all over</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.860" end="01:37:11.110" style="s2">the place the idea that you can wound</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.910" end="01:37:13.900" style="s2">someone with words that you can</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.110" end="01:37:17.390" style="s2">misgender people and that is harassment</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.900" end="01:37:19.190" style="s2">all these things are now part of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.390" end="01:37:20.870" style="s2">common culture because they are</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.190" end="01:37:24.440" style="s2">culturally enforced and they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.870" end="01:37:26.150" style="s2">ruled and base enforced and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.440" end="01:37:28.970" style="s2">the part that I really want to touch on</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.150" end="01:37:31.640" style="s2">with you is you know please in your</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.970" end="01:37:33.530" style="s2">opinion do you think that these</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.640" end="01:37:35.960" style="s2">bureaucratic rules which definitely</p>

<p begin="01:39:06.840" end="01:39:11.100" style="s2">than you most of the time I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.910" end="01:39:13.050" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of exceptions but you can</p>

<p begin="01:44:38.300" end="01:44:43.820" style="s2">but what do you think about that a do</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.730" end="01:44:45.830" style="s2">you see in your research shift in</p>

<p begin="01:44:53.300" end="01:44:58.580" style="s2">that time period if so what do you</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.360" end="01:45:01.040" style="s2">attribute it to and is there any way</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.580" end="01:45:03.760" style="s2">that the title nine DCL compliance and</p>

<p begin="01:45:03.760" end="01:45:11.030" style="s2">it&#39;s very tough to judge you know what</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.200" end="01:45:12.680" style="s2">are the well the first determined that</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.030" end="01:45:14.260" style="s2">something has happened and then look</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.680" end="01:45:16.880" style="s2">well what are the sort of nebulous</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.260" end="01:45:21.380" style="s2">social causes that might have prompted</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.880" end="01:45:25.070" style="s2">it I think I get the feeling that sort</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.380" end="01:45:30.380" style="s2">of identity based antagonism might be</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.070" end="01:45:32.210" style="s2">rising abstractly I think now you</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.380" end="01:45:34.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t see it we often hear they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.210" end="01:45:35.510" style="s2">more hate crimes this is talking about</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.190" end="01:45:36.679" style="s2">this is actually something else I read</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.510" end="01:45:38.389" style="s2">about a lot there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.679" end="01:45:40.219" style="s2">crimes against various identity groups</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.389" end="01:45:42.619" style="s2">then if you look at the data you find</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.219" end="01:45:44.209" style="s2">out that well a different there might</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.619" end="01:45:46.039" style="s2">have been more hate crimes reported than</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.209" end="01:45:47.719" style="s2">last year but it&#39;s just because</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.039" end="01:45:50.269" style="s2">different agencies reported or different</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.719" end="01:45:51.920" style="s2">agencies required to support actually</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.269" end="01:45:53.510" style="s2">maybe more people reported this year so</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.920" end="01:45:55.010" style="s2">then better data just looks like</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.510" end="01:45:56.659" style="s2">something&#39;s getting worse so like this</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.010" end="01:45:57.679" style="s2">is a problem we have actually we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.659" end="01:45:59.360" style="s2">know we&#39;re seeing this a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.679" end="01:46:01.400" style="s2">right now with the pandemic you see oh</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.360" end="01:46:02.300" style="s2">well well we have more cases and you go</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.400" end="01:46:04.400" style="s2">well actually we&#39;re just doing more</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.300" end="01:46:05.749" style="s2">testing well I mean it might be that we</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.400" end="01:46:07.519" style="s2">have more cases but it&#39;s not the clear</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.749" end="01:46:08.929" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know that just just the raw</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.519" end="01:46:10.579" style="s2">number going up doesn&#39;t tell you what</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.929" end="01:46:12.530" style="s2">you need to know and that&#39;s been true</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.579" end="01:46:15.530" style="s2">for for hate crimes</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.530" end="01:46:17.090" style="s2">I think there&#39;s been you know we have to</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.530" end="01:46:19.249" style="s2">look for things that like our actual</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.090" end="01:46:21.949" style="s2">changes so social media did not exist</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.249" end="01:46:25.280" style="s2">broadly into nearly the degree it does</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.949" end="01:46:27.320" style="s2">now before 2010 so it is true that there</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.280" end="01:46:29.659" style="s2">is now a way for people to express their</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.320" end="01:46:32.650" style="s2">views and to sort into like-minded</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.659" end="01:46:36.469" style="s2">groups so if you if you held maybe</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.650" end="01:46:39.439" style="s2">antagonistic views toward toward one</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.469" end="01:46:41.360" style="s2">race or another you know 15 years ago or</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.439" end="01:46:42.860" style="s2">20 years ago you might have thought you</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.360" end="01:46:45.079" style="s2">were alone and you had nowhere to</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.860" end="01:46:46.340" style="s2">express that view but now you can see</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.079" end="01:46:48.229" style="s2">that other people are expressing it you</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.340" end="01:46:50.300" style="s2">can group yourselves together I mean</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.229" end="01:46:53.380" style="s2">this goes for you you could say this of</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.300" end="01:46:57.889" style="s2">any sort of group of people with</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.380" end="01:46:59.209" style="s2">uncommon views so they I think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.889" end="01:47:00.829" style="s2">been able to make themselves more known</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.209" end="01:47:03.260" style="s2">or they&#39;re more noticeable now but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.829" end="01:47:05.090" style="s2">not really that the the membership has</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.260" end="01:47:07.969" style="s2">gone up it&#39;s just that there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.090" end="01:47:10.429" style="s2">more there&#39;s a there&#39;s a better vehicle</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.969" end="01:47:12.530" style="s2">for organizing so then that tend so then</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.429" end="01:47:14.090" style="s2">that makes it look like like we have</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.530" end="01:47:17.479" style="s2">this rising phenomenon for instance of</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.090" end="01:47:19.789" style="s2">the alright when I don&#39;t know that it</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.479" end="01:47:21.800" style="s2">may be like trivially true that it like</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.789" end="01:47:24.170" style="s2">literally people who describe themselves</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.800" end="01:47:25.519" style="s2">that way did not exist previously but</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.170" end="01:47:27.199" style="s2">they did exist they just didn&#39;t describe</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.519" end="01:47:28.489" style="s2">themselves that way and they didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.199" end="01:47:29.659" style="s2">hang out together they didn&#39;t know who</p>

<p begin="01:47:31.489" end="01:47:35.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not act it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.199" end="01:47:39.650" style="s2">that it&#39;s not that like racism has has</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.840" end="01:47:43.099" style="s2">necessarily gone up I do now I the kind</p>

<p begin="01:47:43.099" end="01:47:47.329" style="s2">well has like sensitivity gone up has</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.439" end="01:47:48.889" style="s2">the you know I I&#39;m even trying to trace</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.329" end="01:47:50.389" style="s2">what is it actually true that students</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.889" end="01:47:51.119" style="s2">are getting worse on like free speech</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.389" end="01:47:52.169" style="s2">issues or you</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.119" end="01:47:54.689" style="s2">people are getting worse on free speech</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.169" end="01:47:56.579" style="s2">issues and it just it matters how well</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.689" end="01:47:58.860" style="s2">it matters what question exactly you ask</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.579" end="01:48:00.539" style="s2">them older Americans test very badly on</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.860" end="01:48:03.360" style="s2">free speech depending on how you ask the</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.539" end="01:48:05.219" style="s2">question so you know the the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.360" end="01:48:09.360" style="s2">average of the polling that I can find</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.219" end="01:48:10.889" style="s2">does show that there is some degree of a</p>

<p begin="01:48:10.889" end="01:48:15.689" style="s2">are important among specifically of the</p>

<p begin="01:48:18.059" end="01:48:21.659" style="s2">nineteen seventy and again how it do</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.099" end="01:48:23.489" style="s2">matters how exactly you ask a question</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.659" end="01:48:25.469" style="s2">you can get a result that would look</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.489" end="01:48:27.360" style="s2">more sinister than you get now so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.469" end="01:48:30.419" style="s2">so and then I and then I tend I think I</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.360" end="01:48:32.639" style="s2">suspect I guess at any rate the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.419" end="01:48:36.239" style="s2">safety culture that came into being in</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.639" end="01:48:37.649" style="s2">the 1990s has something to do with</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.239" end="01:48:39.659" style="s2">what&#39;s happening on college campuses</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.649" end="01:48:42.239" style="s2">that you have those people are finally</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.659" end="01:48:44.459" style="s2">coming of age the people who you know</p>

<p begin="01:48:59.159" end="01:49:05.039" style="s2">kind of whole movement of like we got a</p>

<p begin="01:49:11.399" end="01:49:17.669" style="s2">that came out of the 1990s I think had</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.619" end="01:49:19.679" style="s2">and I suspect had a negative impact on a</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.669" end="01:49:22.320" style="s2">lot of young people some young people at</p>

<p begin="01:49:33.329" end="01:49:36.389" style="s2">lead with it or overhype it because</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.829" end="01:49:39.389" style="s2">again it&#39;s just a theory and I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:49:42.419" end="01:49:47.489" style="s2">right that&#39;s exactly right because they</p>

<p begin="01:49:47.489" end="01:49:51.040" style="s2">that time then they were the ones</p>

<p begin="01:49:51.040" end="01:49:54.940" style="s2">and they&#39;re the ones that are causing</p>

<p begin="01:49:54.940" end="01:49:58.120" style="s2">it&#39;s true maybe it isn&#39;t but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.530" end="01:50:00.730" style="s2">been clearly a change there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.120" end="01:50:02.980" style="s2">clearly at least a change in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.730" end="01:50:04.750" style="s2">conversations and in the narratives and</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.980" end="01:50:07.900" style="s2">then in the reaction and then these</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.750" end="01:50:10.840" style="s2">hyper empowered tyrannical minorities</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.900" end="01:50:12.220" style="s2">are now equipped with tools by which</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.840" end="01:50:14.410" style="s2">they can spread their narratives and</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.220" end="01:50:16.600" style="s2">their ideas and a much more forceful and</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.410" end="01:50:18.340" style="s2">impactful way you combine that with the</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.600" end="01:50:19.750" style="s2">teaching that they get in critical</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.340" end="01:50:21.700" style="s2">theory that they have to make change</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.750" end="01:50:23.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll just talk about it and all of a</p>

<p begin="01:50:23.560" end="01:50:28.570" style="s2">recipe and a whole just a stack of</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.650" end="01:50:30.520" style="s2">things on top of each other that it has</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.570" end="01:50:32.680" style="s2">led to this moment that we&#39;re at right</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.520" end="01:50:34.420" style="s2">now so I&#39;m I&#39;m ready to start bringing</p>

<p begin="01:51:01.810" end="01:51:06.010" style="s2">I certainly had a small handful of</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.000" end="01:51:08.950" style="s2">issues and most of them were around</p>

<p begin="01:51:31.990" end="01:51:36.630" style="s2">system and I want to see how can I</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.630" end="01:51:41.350" style="s2">disrupt this system which I&#39;m opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.630" end="01:51:45.010" style="s2">and reforming title 9 was probably my</p>

<p begin="01:51:45.010" end="01:51:49.060" style="s2">so happens and this is why we&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="01:52:23.800" end="01:52:28.300" style="s2">important to me and it really felt like</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.260" end="01:52:30.070" style="s2">something momentous happened in this</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.300" end="01:52:31.690" style="s2">arena in the last week so let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:52:31.690" end="01:52:37.030" style="s2">what&#39;s the final story yes it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.570" end="01:52:39.550" style="s2">taken a couple years because the</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.030" end="01:52:42.010" style="s2">Secretary of Education did go through</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.550" end="01:52:45.190" style="s2">proper procedures did do rulemaking and</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.010" end="01:52:46.449" style="s2">comment did seek input from all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.190" end="01:52:48.369" style="s2">interested stakeholders she did</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.449" end="01:52:50.349" style="s2">everything by the book so it&#39;s which</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.369" end="01:52:56.099" style="s2">means it&#39;s taken a while but last week</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.349" end="01:52:58.840" style="s2">they announced the revisions to title 9</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.099" end="01:53:00.940" style="s2">undoing she so she had already cancelled</p>

<p begin="01:53:00.940" end="01:53:07.590" style="s2">the bad advice but now she has announced</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.119" end="01:53:12.010" style="s2">the the kind of the new policies which</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.590" end="01:53:13.960" style="s2">which go a good amount toward Rhian</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.010" end="01:53:16.719" style="s2">shrining some semblance of due process</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.960" end="01:53:19.420" style="s2">and basic fairness she is now saying</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.719" end="01:53:21.489" style="s2">there has to be a hearing your the</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.420" end="01:53:24.579" style="s2">representatives for the accused and the</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.489" end="01:53:26.710" style="s2">accuser their lawyers or representatives</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.579" end="01:53:28.300" style="s2">need to be able to cross-examine each</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.710" end="01:53:30.909" style="s2">other so there needs to be actually</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.300" end="01:53:33.190" style="s2">presentation of evidence so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.909" end="01:53:34.900" style="s2">good thing there&#39;s been some of those</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.190" end="01:53:38.320" style="s2">limiting factors I talked about are</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.900" end="01:53:40.210" style="s2">explicitly in this in this in the new</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.320" end="01:53:42.820" style="s2">rules so it&#39;s not just any unwelcome</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.210" end="01:53:46.500" style="s2">conduct of a sexual nature it has to</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.820" end="01:53:49.719" style="s2">also be severe pervasive etc or for</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.500" end="01:53:51.579" style="s2">sexual harassment for the kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.719" end="01:53:53.440" style="s2">general sexual harassment conduct it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.579" end="01:53:55.989" style="s2">still you know quid pro quo harassment</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.440" end="01:53:57.369" style="s2">if oh you know if a professor says I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.989" end="01:54:01.030" style="s2">give you an A if you sleep with me that</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.369" end="01:54:02.409" style="s2">still under the existing you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.030" end="01:54:04.329" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t need to rise to a</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.409" end="01:54:06.599" style="s2">level of pervy R severe purpose for</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.329" end="01:54:09.760" style="s2">something but there&#39;s a lot of good</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.599" end="01:54:11.210" style="s2">guardrails being put back in but also</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.760" end="01:54:13.970" style="s2">and I mentioned earlier the</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.210" end="01:54:15.560" style="s2">you can that you don&#39;t have to initiate</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.970" end="01:54:16.700" style="s2">a title line investigation if the victim</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.560" end="01:54:18.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want that I mean that was</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.700" end="01:54:21.470" style="s2">happening under the existing got like</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.980" end="01:54:24.620" style="s2">this was a poorly understood aspect I</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.470" end="01:54:27.200" style="s2">covered cases where a where the alleged</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.620" end="01:54:28.730" style="s2">victim the purported victim was not what</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.200" end="01:54:30.530" style="s2">had not complained like this is</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.730" end="01:54:32.990" style="s2">something people didn&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.530" end="01:54:35.480" style="s2">investigation was not necessarily being</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.990" end="01:54:37.640" style="s2">initiated by the victim because the</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.480" end="01:54:39.170" style="s2">victim was technically the victim but</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.640" end="01:54:41.360" style="s2">really the nature of the victim was the</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.170" end="01:54:43.010" style="s2">university in a sense they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.360" end="01:54:45.380" style="s2">the ones who aren&#39;t going to be punished</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.010" end="01:54:47.840" style="s2">for not complying with title 9 so they</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.380" end="01:54:50.690" style="s2">were investigating some cases where the</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.840" end="01:54:51.860" style="s2">victim said nothing happened to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.690" end="01:54:53.870" style="s2">alright sometimes there was a boyfriend</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.860" end="01:54:55.730" style="s2">and girlfriend and in a jealous friend</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.870" end="01:54:58.160" style="s2">or a neighbor or a coach or something</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.730" end="01:54:59.960" style="s2">reported it and the accused said no I</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.160" end="01:55:02.030" style="s2">nothing happened I don&#39;t want this to go</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.960" end="01:55:04.130" style="s2">forward and the university said excuse</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.030" end="01:55:05.900" style="s2">me we will determine if there has been a</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.130" end="01:55:08.180" style="s2">violation you don&#39;t determine that we</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.900" end="01:55:09.950" style="s2">determine that and you know they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.180" end="01:55:11.120" style="s2">call the victims a witness and so what</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.950" end="01:55:14.540" style="s2">happens the person is found to getting</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.120" end="01:55:16.550" style="s2">expelled like again I think every person</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.540" end="01:55:17.900" style="s2">on earth would say that was insane and</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.550" end="01:55:20.750" style="s2">unfair and that happened multiple times</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.900" end="01:55:23.570" style="s2">so now there&#39;s so there&#39;s less of a</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.750" end="01:55:26.870" style="s2">burden a less of an obligation under the</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.570" end="01:55:29.510" style="s2">new the new rules for the university</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.870" end="01:55:30.800" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to initiate if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.510" end="01:55:32.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not what the victim wants if the</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.800" end="01:55:34.160" style="s2">victim wants something else just to be</p>
