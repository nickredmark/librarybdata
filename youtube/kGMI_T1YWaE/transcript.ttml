<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">from personal experience it&#39;s it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">thing to be on the interviewee or</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:29.549" style="s2">interviewer side of the equation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">another thing to be interviewed and so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.549" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">find myself curious um what for you was</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:39.049" style="s2">the inspiration to move out of your work</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:41.939" style="s2">with the BBC and in media and create</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.049" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">what is a pretty radical departure this</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.939" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">whole rebel wisdom media project what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">was behind that for you yeah I have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">say I prefer asking the questions rather</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:57.950" style="s2">than answering them but yeah it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">very spontaneous for quite a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.950" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">when I was working I work for Channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">four News for many years I left to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">documentaries for Channel four and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">the BBC channel for news for people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">aren&#39;t sort of familiar with the UK is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">is generally regard that is probably one</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:16.799" style="s2">of the two</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:19.019" style="s2">most high-quality news programs and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.799" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">was working for the foreign unit so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.019" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">was in Libya during the the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">Gaddafi I was in Tahrir Square when</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:29.189" style="s2">Mubarak resigned which was an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">opportunity and something that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.189" end="00:02:34.019" style="s2">never forget like I was really at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">center of some fairly amazing moments</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.019" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">but at the same time when I look back</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:43.349" style="s2">there was something that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">missing in terms of my feeling of where</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.349" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">I was meant to be and what I was meant</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:51.359" style="s2">to be doing and I think that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">to I studied philosophy and I&#39;d always</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.359" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">been doing a lot of personal growth work</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">and been very interested in spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:01.340" style="s2">and very interested in what you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:03.629" style="s2">call the kind of paradigm shift and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.340" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">feeling very keenly that there is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.629" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">need for this paradigm shift especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:10.829" style="s2">out of out of sort of the naive</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">materialism of the culture that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.829" end="00:03:16.799" style="s2">at the moment and realizing that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">kind of perspective was not very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.799" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">bring into the mainstream media yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">most of the gatekeepers in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:26.629" style="s2">mainstream media are sort of under the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:30.209" style="s2">sway of the sort of very Dawkins aiight</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.629" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">scientific realism so those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.209" end="00:03:35.000" style="s2">programs that looked at kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:37.909" style="s2">reality of spiritual experience or</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.000" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">religion or the sort of the full</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.909" end="00:03:42.510" style="s2">360-degree picture of what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">be human we&#39;re not being commissioned</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.510" end="00:03:50.310" style="s2">and also I just had this sense that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">there was there were perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.310" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">were not being brought forward into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">media I didn&#39;t really know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">about that at the time and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">the technolog technology existed to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:02.479" style="s2">able to do anything about it at the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">either and it sort of been this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.479" end="00:04:09.150" style="s2">technological revolution and then rebel</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">wisdom happened very spontaneous you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.150" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">could even say synchronistically because</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:19.769" style="s2">I saw Jordan Peterson emerge probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:22.469" style="s2">about 18 months ago and my immediate</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.769" end="00:04:24.599" style="s2">reaction I dive I&#39;d go very deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.469" end="00:04:27.450" style="s2">the Bible lectures I was immediately</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.599" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">struck by here was someone talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.450" end="00:04:31.410" style="s2">young it was someone talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">deep mythopoetic structure of the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.410" end="00:04:37.200" style="s2">and I was completely gripped by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">message and I just had this very strong</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.200" end="00:04:42.480" style="s2">sense this is exactly what our culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.810" end="00:04:47.670" style="s2">is missing right now this is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.480" end="00:04:50.250" style="s2">what we&#39;ve forgotten and he and so I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.670" end="00:04:53.820" style="s2">went to go over to Toronto actually to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.250" end="00:04:56.760" style="s2">Bible lecture I thought well some people</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.820" end="00:04:58.650" style="s2">pay I know a few hundred pounds to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.760" end="00:04:59.970" style="s2">and see their favorite sports team and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:00.600" style="s2">might as well go and see him give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.970" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">lecture</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.600" end="00:05:04.920" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until I&#39;d actually booked to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">go for the Bible lecture I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.920" end="00:05:11.310" style="s2">I am a journalist I could ask him in for</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">an interview and so I did and he granted</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.310" end="00:05:15.830" style="s2">me an interview the day after the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.570" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">lecture which I was very pleased by and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.830" end="00:05:20.610" style="s2">then we did the interview and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:21.570" style="s2">until I&#39;d actually done the interview</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.610" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">that I thought well no one&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.570" end="00:05:28.650" style="s2">made a documentary about him yet this</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">was October 2017 I think yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.650" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">is well before most people had ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:35.010" style="s2">heard of him as well you know so I then</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:36.660" style="s2">thought okay I&#39;m gonna turn it into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.010" end="00:05:39.060" style="s2">documentary which I did over the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.660" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">couple of months and that became truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.060" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">in the time of chaos the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:45.990" style="s2">documentary and I still think I still</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:47.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s worth people maybe going back</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.990" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">and having a look at the interview that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.400" end="00:05:53.550" style="s2">I did with him in in October 2017</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:55.230" style="s2">because there&#39;s a real I asked him a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.550" end="00:05:57.270" style="s2">about young a lot about the integration</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.230" end="00:05:59.100" style="s2">of the shadow that&#39;s when things start</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.270" end="00:06:01.890" style="s2">to line up yeah and the more you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.100" end="00:06:04.920" style="s2">that space the more they line up and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.890" end="00:06:05.850" style="s2">the question is if you&#39;re like really in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.920" end="00:06:08.460" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.850" end="00:06:10.350" style="s2">how much do things line up I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.460" end="00:06:14.640" style="s2">experiences where everything came</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.350" end="00:06:16.620" style="s2">together you know and and and there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.640" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">very very powerful experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.620" end="00:06:23.490" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re also characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:25.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like everything turns into a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.490" end="00:06:28.470" style="s2">musical symphony where each part is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.820" end="00:06:31.530" style="s2">exactly appropriate for that moment and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.470" end="00:06:33.570" style="s2">and I think music actually expresses</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.530" end="00:06:35.220" style="s2">that which is partly why music produces</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.570" end="00:06:37.590" style="s2">transcendent experiences you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.220" end="00:06:39.730" style="s2">think it is an intimation of Paradise</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.590" end="00:06:41.380" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.730" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">and you can think about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.380" end="00:06:46.750" style="s2">psychologically you know because it also</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:50.140" style="s2">makes sense psychologically that your</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.750" end="00:06:52.270" style="s2">optimal experiences are going to occur</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.140" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">when you&#39;re most United with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.270" end="00:06:57.040" style="s2">and but I don&#39;t know what see we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:58.600" style="s2">exactly understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.040" end="00:07:01.330" style="s2">between our consciousness and the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.600" end="00:07:04.390" style="s2">we&#39;re at our best when we&#39;re integrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.330" end="00:07:08.140" style="s2">completely and there is an effect of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.390" end="00:07:09.670" style="s2">that integration in principle on what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.140" end="00:07:12.130" style="s2">would normally regard as external</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.670" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">reality because external reality can</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.130" end="00:07:17.800" style="s2">line up with that integration as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">and so-called external reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.800" end="00:07:24.270" style="s2">I also think that figures like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:27.220" style="s2">Buddha you know he&#39;s an exemplar of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.270" end="00:07:29.410" style="s2">possibilities of that alignment and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.220" end="00:07:31.000" style="s2">exercises the yogic exercises for</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.410" end="00:07:32.740" style="s2">example our attempts to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.000" end="00:07:35.110" style="s2">alignment into being you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.740" end="00:07:36.430" style="s2">it&#39;s very centered on the body which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.110" end="00:07:38.170" style="s2">quite interesting even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.430" end="00:07:40.570" style="s2">spiritual tradition right it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.170" end="00:07:42.460" style="s2">centered on the body and I think people</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.570" end="00:07:45.220" style="s2">probably experience that when they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.460" end="00:07:47.020" style="s2">peak sexual experiences with someone you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.220" end="00:07:49.000" style="s2">know where there&#39;s real intimacy because</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.020" end="00:07:51.190" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same place at the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.000" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">time and everything comes together for</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.190" end="00:07:58.600" style="s2">that moment you know maybe literally yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:08:01.180" style="s2">yes literally right and and and I also</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.600" end="00:08:06.460" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that linguistic usage</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.180" end="00:08:10.320" style="s2">is chance right because I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.460" end="00:08:14.170" style="s2">place where that experience is a brief</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.320" end="00:08:16.810" style="s2">intimation of of heaven that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.170" end="00:08:17.980" style="s2">way of thinking about it I&#39;ve really not</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.810" end="00:08:20.020" style="s2">seen him ask those kind of questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.980" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">many times since a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.020" end="00:08:24.670" style="s2">really focused on the politics have</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:27.790" style="s2">focused on the gender stuff and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.670" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">think it&#39;s really missing the point</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.790" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">to look at Peterson through a political</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:34.600" style="s2">and gender politics lens I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:35.890" style="s2">valid they&#39;re valid questions to ask for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.600" end="00:08:38.530" style="s2">sure and he&#39;s definitely a controversial</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.890" end="00:08:42.070" style="s2">figure and there&#39;s a lot to unpack in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.530" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">his worldview but to have someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.070" end="00:08:46.900" style="s2">arguing for the reality of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:48.280" style="s2">experience the reality of something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.900" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">psychedelics to bring about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.280" end="00:08:52.660" style="s2">spiritual experience the reality of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:56.199" style="s2">deep mythopoetic layer that we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.660" end="00:08:58.509" style="s2">to connect to and seeing him arguing</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.199" end="00:09:01.149" style="s2">that on the on the kind of world stage</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.509" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">is still astonishing an academic who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.149" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">who&#39;s quoting young despite the fact he</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:07.300" style="s2">was told from the beginning of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:10.449" style="s2">academic career don&#39;t mention your on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.300" end="00:09:12.279" style="s2">your torpedo your career if you do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.449" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">a it&#39;s an astonishing thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.279" end="00:09:17.949" style="s2">should not forget I think despite what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:19.209" style="s2">happened since terms though I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.949" end="00:09:21.069" style="s2">there&#39;s so many different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.209" end="00:09:23.050" style="s2">tangents we could go down already I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.069" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">sure but I just wanted to complete the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.050" end="00:09:29.740" style="s2">the the the answer of where rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:32.920" style="s2">came from because it then I then turned</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.740" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">it into this documentary and then a few</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.920" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">days after I released that documentary</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:40.839" style="s2">he then had that famous encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:43.899" style="s2">Kathy Newman on Channel four News where</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.839" end="00:09:45.699" style="s2">I had been working only a few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.899" end="00:09:49.779" style="s2">before I was still freelancing there</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.699" end="00:09:51.339" style="s2">even though I&#39;d left there and so and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.779" end="00:09:53.139" style="s2">considering most of my interview with</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.339" end="00:09:55.509" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was about synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.139" end="00:09:57.399" style="s2">and was about these kind of meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.509" end="00:10:00.100" style="s2">coincidences and how do we make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.399" end="00:10:02.380" style="s2">them and what how do we follow the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:06.310" style="s2">thread of these synchronicities that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.380" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">an extraordinary thing chronicity and at</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.310" end="00:10:11.730" style="s2">first what I tried to do was to liaison</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:14.439" style="s2">the scenes cuz it was almost like seeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.730" end="00:10:16.630" style="s2">your parents fighting or something it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.439" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">was Channel 4 News had one perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.630" end="00:10:20.889" style="s2">and they were very upset because Kathy</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.209" style="s2">was getting a lot of abuse online Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.889" end="00:10:26.470" style="s2">cleared her son was very upset because</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.209" end="00:10:28.060" style="s2">he felt that he was being framed as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.470" end="00:10:30.670" style="s2">villain and and he hadn&#39;t done anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.060" end="00:10:32.230" style="s2">wrong and I thought and he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.670" end="00:10:34.779" style="s2">another interview with Kathy and I try</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.230" end="00:10:35.559" style="s2">to liaise between them that didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.779" end="00:10:37.540" style="s2">anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.559" end="00:10:39.579" style="s2">Jordan was happy to do it Kathy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.540" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">Channel 4 News were just just wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.579" end="00:10:46.870" style="s2">to go away by that point and so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:49.509" style="s2">process of what am I supposed to do with</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.870" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">this strange coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.509" end="00:10:57.100" style="s2">turned into the film glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:59.829" style="s2">matrix which I pretty much came through</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.100" end="00:11:05.309" style="s2">and in a real sort of flow state over</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.829" end="00:11:06.400" style="s2">about two weeks in January 2018 and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.309" end="00:11:09.280" style="s2">included</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.400" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">awful lot of things that had been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.280" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">been thinking about since the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:15.160" style="s2">election so Jordan green Hall I got in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:18.340" style="s2">touch with and did an interview with him</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.160" end="00:11:20.620" style="s2">and he&#39;s a big voice in the film Ken</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.340" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2">will was Trump in a post truth world was</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.620" end="00:11:27.070" style="s2">not actually named in there but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">real underpinning of a lot of the a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.070" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">of the arguments in it and actually when</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:33.790" style="s2">I spoke to Jeff Souls Minh of the daily</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:35.740" style="s2">of all that he said that documentary was</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.790" end="00:11:38.680" style="s2">a pure integral download which was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.740" end="00:11:41.560" style="s2">pleased with because it was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.680" end="00:11:44.650" style="s2">informed by the shadow of liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.560" end="00:11:46.120" style="s2">what is it what is the liberal overreach</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.650" end="00:11:49.390" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing at the moment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.120" end="00:11:53.590" style="s2">provoking Trump provoking brexit</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.390" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">provoking this kind of rejection of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.590" end="00:12:00.610" style="s2">everyone up until 2016 thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">kind of liberal an ever more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.610" end="00:12:06.070" style="s2">society and what it what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">liberal liberals need to own about their</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.070" end="00:12:10.270" style="s2">own shadow their own kind of tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:13.390" style="s2">that pretends that it&#39;s not a tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.270" end="00:12:17.380" style="s2">to for the conversation to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.390" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">and so glitch in the matrix then Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.380" end="00:12:22.690" style="s2">Peterson watched it loved it and put it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:24.430" style="s2">on his channel and that has that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.690" end="00:12:26.170" style="s2">by far the most viewed piece it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.430" end="00:12:31.210" style="s2">viewed over a million times on Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.170" end="00:12:32.830" style="s2">channel and hers is still the piece that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.210" end="00:12:36.670" style="s2">people kind of get in touch the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.830" end="00:12:39.280" style="s2">about and one little kind of big head of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.670" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">plug I&#39;ve sort of been tracking it since</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.280" end="00:12:43.390" style="s2">Jordan put it onto his channel it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:46.060" style="s2">I think either the fifth or the sixth</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.390" end="00:12:47.890" style="s2">most viewed piece on his own channel on</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.060" end="00:12:49.750" style="s2">his channel on his channel which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.890" end="00:12:51.100" style="s2">pretty amazing considering it only went</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.750" end="00:12:53.170" style="s2">up about a year ago and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:56.470" style="s2">stuff there has been up there for four</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.170" end="00:13:00.850" style="s2">years yeah so so that&#39;s the long and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.470" end="00:13:04.050" style="s2">short of it there were these two films</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.850" end="00:13:07.150" style="s2">that emerge very spontaneously and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.050" end="00:13:10.390" style="s2">the the channel emerged off the back of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.150" end="00:13:12.100" style="s2">that and I clearly kind of leveraged my</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.390" end="00:13:13.690" style="s2">experience with channel 4 and the BBC</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.100" end="00:13:16.210" style="s2">into getting the interview Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.690" end="00:13:17.860" style="s2">Peterson there&#39;s clearly a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.210" end="00:13:19.580" style="s2">sealing that&#39;s the way you can get with</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.860" end="00:13:21.140" style="s2">a podcast or a channel</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.580" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">until you&#39;ve got a couple of big names</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.140" end="00:13:25.400" style="s2">on it and then you can use that as your</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:28.340" style="s2">reputation to get more people on and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.400" end="00:13:30.110" style="s2">was with that with with my background</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.340" end="00:13:32.420" style="s2">and with the access to Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.110" end="00:13:36.710" style="s2">to be able to to kind of springboard</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.420" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">onto some other big names yeah well and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.710" end="00:13:41.810" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean what I&#39;m really struck by</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:44.450" style="s2">in in the story you just shared and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.810" end="00:13:46.130" style="s2">just in watching this unfold in real</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.450" end="00:13:48.980" style="s2">time because I remember you know when</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.130" end="00:13:51.710" style="s2">you release these documentaries I recall</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:55.310" style="s2">when Jordan Peterson really just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.710" end="00:13:57.860" style="s2">exploded onto the scene and that it felt</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.310" end="00:14:01.460" style="s2">like he was kind of breaking some sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.860" end="00:14:06.530" style="s2">of conversational seal that then many</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.460" end="00:14:08.420" style="s2">other actors came in behind him right he</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.530" end="00:14:10.090" style="s2">was kind of this this first mover who</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.420" end="00:14:14.900" style="s2">then opened up this whole new territory</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.090" end="00:14:20.450" style="s2">that I now associate rebel wisdom very</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.900" end="00:14:22.910" style="s2">much with convening people in right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.450" end="00:14:24.380" style="s2">it&#39;s this I guess you know you&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.910" end="00:14:26.120" style="s2">this term and you&#39;ve explored this term</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.380" end="00:14:28.580" style="s2">through a rebel ystem of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.120" end="00:14:30.710" style="s2">intellectual dark web is it was a Brett</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.580" end="00:14:34.550" style="s2">Weinstein or Eric that they coined up</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.710" end="00:14:36.590" style="s2">Eric Eric Weinstein coin in this term</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.550" end="00:14:39.980" style="s2">the intellectual dark web and so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.590" end="00:14:41.870" style="s2">done I think a lot of mmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.980" end="00:14:44.840" style="s2">careful study of that term and what what</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.870" end="00:14:47.240" style="s2">what what what exactly it is that people</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.840" end="00:14:49.520" style="s2">are describing when they they use that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.240" end="00:14:52.190" style="s2">phrase what what&#39;s your perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.520" end="00:14:56.930" style="s2">it now is somebody who I think is more</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.190" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">and more responsible for for it you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.930" end="00:14:59.210" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of hosting these</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:00.830" style="s2">conversations that people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.210" end="00:15:03.170" style="s2">increasingly identifying with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.830" end="00:15:04.850" style="s2">intellectual dark web so what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.170" end="00:15:08.210" style="s2">going on there that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.850" end="00:15:11.180" style="s2">question because we have the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.210" end="00:15:13.370" style="s2">phenomenon that has now got the name the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.180" end="00:15:15.560" style="s2">intellectual dark web and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.370" end="00:15:20.270" style="s2">the intellectual dark web itself which</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.560" end="00:15:23.420" style="s2">is if you look at the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.270" end="00:15:26.510" style="s2">article the Barry Weiss wrote I think in</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.420" end="00:15:28.540" style="s2">summer 2018 probably the names in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.510" end="00:15:31.190" style="s2">are the names of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.540" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">officially in the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.190" end="00:15:35.639" style="s2">there I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:38.790" style="s2">Barry Barry Weiss was talking quite a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.639" end="00:15:41.699" style="s2">lot to the members of it into Eric who</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.790" end="00:15:45.240" style="s2">came up with the term and also the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.699" end="00:15:47.879" style="s2">origin of that of what has now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.240" end="00:15:52.740" style="s2">surfaced as the intellectual dark web as</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.879" end="00:15:54.930" style="s2">this kind of space for conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.740" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">released a film glitching the matrix to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.930" end="00:16:00.059" style="s2">actually a couple of weeks ago which was</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:03.569" style="s2">a long Illustrated interview with Eric</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.059" end="00:16:06.930" style="s2">talking about where the term came from</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.569" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">and where why it&#39;s necessary given the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.930" end="00:16:15.870" style="s2">structures that he&#39;s seen being erected</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:18.089" style="s2">since the 1980s in inside institutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.870" end="00:16:20.879" style="s2">frameworks and how institutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.089" end="00:16:23.790" style="s2">frameworks have steadily more and more</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.879" end="00:16:29.029" style="s2">been keeping out the heterodox voices</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.790" end="00:16:33.990" style="s2">hmm and how we&#39;ve replaced genuine</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.029" end="00:16:36.470" style="s2">genius and without genius with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.990" end="00:16:39.809" style="s2">excellence effectively then as</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:42.449" style="s2">structures develop what they reward is</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.809" end="00:16:45.389" style="s2">people who go along with an already</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.449" end="00:16:47.819" style="s2">existing status quo excellent people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.389" end="00:16:51.170" style="s2">play by the rules rather than people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.819" end="00:16:54.149" style="s2">challenge the paradigms that those</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.170" end="00:16:55.980" style="s2">organizations are based on and if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.149" end="00:16:58.459" style="s2">continue to do that what you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:17:01.860" style="s2">is very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.459" end="00:17:04.260" style="s2">institutions especially once those</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.860" end="00:17:05.370" style="s2">institutions are under more and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.260" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">pressure and there are more</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.370" end="00:17:11.220" style="s2">destabilizing forces as there are in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:14.459" style="s2">culture right now and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.220" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">really worth I really urge anyone to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.459" end="00:17:18.089" style="s2">and watch that documentary and maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:21.079" style="s2">player clip from it now I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.089" end="00:17:23.309" style="s2">everybody in the IDW is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:26.610" style="s2">disagreeable in the sense of the Big</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.309" end="00:17:28.169" style="s2">Five personality inventory so can you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.610" end="00:17:30.149" style="s2">hold a position when you&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.169" end="00:17:32.220" style="s2">person in a room that believes that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.149" end="00:17:34.649" style="s2">thing if it&#39;s you versus a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.220" end="00:17:38.760" style="s2">people I would say almost everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.649" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">the core of the IDW is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.760" end="00:17:42.120" style="s2">holding a position where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:45.299" style="s2">against you and I think that that trait</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.120" end="00:17:46.070" style="s2">is extremely rare do you see the IDW is</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.299" end="00:17:49.390" style="s2">primarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.070" end="00:17:53.780" style="s2">school project no I don&#39;t I see it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.390" end="00:17:58.700" style="s2">primarily as a precursor to anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.780" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">decent its what has to succeed for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.700" end="00:18:01.730" style="s2">have a political conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:03.980" style="s2">think we&#39;re having a political</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:06.380" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s this kind of loosely</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.980" end="00:18:09.980" style="s2">affiliated network of people and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.380" end="00:18:12.260" style="s2">quote-unquote in or out of the IDW you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.980" end="00:18:16.850" style="s2">know there doesn&#39;t seem to be any kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:20.090" style="s2">of boundary there but it does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.850" end="00:18:23.350" style="s2">performing a purpose which is presencing</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.090" end="00:18:29.690" style="s2">all of these heterodox as you say ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.350" end="00:18:31.970" style="s2">into the discourse and my I have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.690" end="00:18:35.570" style="s2">feeling like there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.970" end="00:18:38.870" style="s2">emerging worldview being articulated not</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.570" end="00:18:41.030" style="s2">by any single individual but through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.870" end="00:18:43.790" style="s2">collective conversation like the Gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.030" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">of the conversation as it happens across</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.790" end="00:18:49.670" style="s2">many different mediums and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:51.950" style="s2">the nature of the IDW makes it so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.670" end="00:18:53.330" style="s2">people like yourself you know curators</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.950" end="00:18:55.250" style="s2">the people who are having that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.330" end="00:18:57.290" style="s2">hosting the conversations are in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.250" end="00:18:58.970" style="s2">of unique position because unlike the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:00.920" style="s2">people you&#39;re talking to you&#39;re not as</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.970" end="00:19:03.020" style="s2">much locked into a particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.920" end="00:19:04.910" style="s2">perspective and so I one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.020" end="00:19:08.410" style="s2">I&#39;m most curious about is you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.910" end="00:19:10.760" style="s2">what&#39;s your sense of this emerging</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.410" end="00:19:12.950" style="s2">worldview like what what what what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.760" end="00:19:15.590" style="s2">are the bounder contours of it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.950" end="00:19:18.290" style="s2">what are what&#39;s being articulated not</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.590" end="00:19:20.930" style="s2">buying a single individual by the kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.290" end="00:19:24.050" style="s2">of collective I think like I said before</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.930" end="00:19:28.700" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.050" end="00:19:31.370" style="s2">is the emerging what is the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.700" end="00:19:33.170" style="s2">phenomenon that is outside the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.370" end="00:19:36.250" style="s2">itself because if you say who is in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.170" end="00:19:39.410" style="s2">IDW at the moment I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.250" end="00:19:42.050" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to know I think it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.410" end="00:19:46.190" style="s2">is pretty much whoever Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.050" end="00:19:52.180" style="s2">says is in the IDW right and yet there</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.190" end="00:19:54.530" style="s2">is an emerging consensus that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.180" end="00:19:56.840" style="s2">certainly applying to more than just the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.530" end="00:19:59.810" style="s2">IDW I mean you can look at the success</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.840" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">of something like Willett</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.810" end="00:20:05.450" style="s2">online magazine Claire layman started in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:08.540" style="s2">in Australia I think in 2015 and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.450" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">just gone from strength to strength over</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.540" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">the last year especially and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:17.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:19.310" style="s2">good place to look I think and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.060" end="00:20:21.410" style="s2">Colette pretty much is filling the void</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.310" end="00:20:23.510" style="s2">that Colette is filling it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.410" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">known as the in-house online magazine</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.510" end="00:20:30.500" style="s2">for the IDW and if you look at the void</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.870" end="00:20:32.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s filling it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.870" end="00:20:38.630" style="s2">media and there are things that are well</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.630" end="00:20:43.490" style="s2">example the innate differences between</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.860" end="00:20:50.420" style="s2">happened is there&#39;s a worldview that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.200" end="00:20:54.560" style="s2">hardened into an ideology in the media</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.420" end="00:20:57.470" style="s2">that is not really supported by the</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.380" end="00:21:13.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really I thought that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.450" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">really great way of phrasing it what we</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:35.210" style="s2">a kind of we looked at it through this</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.210" end="00:21:41.860" style="s2">could say it&#39;s a green world view but</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.150" end="00:21:45.140" style="s2">that world view has become increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.860" end="00:21:46.670" style="s2">an ideology and there are certain views</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.670" end="00:22:05.000" style="s2">kind of overall frame is the Google memo</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:07.970" style="s2">was a really interesting moment in in</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.000" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">culture yeah and collect one of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:13.190" style="s2">big breakthrough articles was for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.930" style="s2">academics respond</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.190" end="00:22:17.690" style="s2">the Google memo and it went viral</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.930" end="00:22:19.880" style="s2">because they were able to because Claire</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.690" end="00:22:22.130" style="s2">Mae layman was an academic herself so</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.880" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">she was able to know exactly who the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.130" end="00:22:27.290" style="s2">right people were to go to to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:29.750" style="s2">look at the Google memo that James</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.290" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">d&#39;amour put together which was</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.750" end="00:22:34.280" style="s2">characterized in the media as an anti</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:35.990" style="s2">diversity screed they literally more</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.990" end="00:22:41.150" style="s2">there&#39;s even people I was asking the</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.150" end="00:22:48.350" style="s2">said he&#39;s never seen a document that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.730" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">publicly available to so many</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.350" end="00:22:53.180" style="s2">journalists be mischaracterized by so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:57.680" style="s2">many journalists hmm and so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.180" end="00:22:59.960" style="s2">real failure along the by the by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.680" end="00:23:03.590" style="s2">mainstream media around the Google memo</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.960" end="00:23:05.960" style="s2">and then so it had all of these graphs</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.590" end="00:23:09.680" style="s2">it had all of these kind of and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.960" end="00:23:12.020" style="s2">explicitly framed it as if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.680" end="00:23:13.490" style="s2">increase diversity in tech we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.020" end="00:23:15.710" style="s2">told that the only reason for the lack</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.490" end="00:23:17.870" style="s2">of diversity is discrimination there</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.710" end="00:23:19.700" style="s2">could be other reasons and he even put</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.870" end="00:23:22.160" style="s2">forward some suggestions which are if</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.700" end="00:23:23.510" style="s2">men are unbalanced more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.160" end="00:23:26.300" style="s2">things and women are more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.510" end="00:23:28.070" style="s2">people maybe we should introduce more</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.300" end="00:23:30.470" style="s2">working together in teams</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.070" end="00:23:32.060" style="s2">he actually put forward some some</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.470" end="00:23:35.510" style="s2">suggestions of what to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.060" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">but then the Colet so cool that were</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.510" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">then able to to get for academics to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:45.350" style="s2">respond to him pretty much say he got</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">most of the science right um he then</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.350" end="00:23:50.450" style="s2">there may be things that he over</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">overplayed but he got most of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.450" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">science right and for him to affect he</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:59.180" style="s2">been sacked for that certainly through a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:01.280" style="s2">chill put a chill in to just about</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.180" end="00:24:03.380" style="s2">everyone working in tech it made it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.280" end="00:24:04.520" style="s2">absolutely clear to everyone where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:07.820" style="s2">boundaries were and that where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.520" end="00:24:09.140" style="s2">boundaries well how far they could go</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.820" end="00:24:11.410" style="s2">and that was a that was a hugely</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.140" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">significant significant cultural moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.410" end="00:24:18.860" style="s2">moment where the media failed and qualit</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:22.660" style="s2">was able to to fill a gap and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.860" end="00:24:25.580" style="s2">passing that for me I think is where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.660" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">that that&#39;s where most of the the</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.430" end="00:24:42.820" style="s2">really do that without pointing to their</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.360" end="00:24:44.980" style="s2">hat an ideology has emerged that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.820" end="00:24:46.990" style="s2">trying to shut down a lot of debates and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.980" end="00:24:49.030" style="s2">you can&#39;t really get away from that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.990" end="00:24:52.030" style="s2">I&#39;d like to play a piece actually from</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.030" end="00:24:54.280" style="s2">from Brett Weinstein now where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.030" end="00:24:57.640" style="s2">about that so we are all watching</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">others will tell you oh it&#39;s a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.870" end="00:25:14.530" style="s2">number of people so it&#39;s you&#39;re blowing</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:51.490" style="s2">headed and I guess I&#39;m curious for you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.929" end="00:28:53.839" style="s2">as another person who&#39;s convening these</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.429" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a really great question because</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:12.289" style="s2">it really fits so I think pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:13.789" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s been following the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.289" end="00:29:16.789" style="s2">emergence of Jordan Peterson the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.789" end="00:29:18.469" style="s2">emergence of the IDW and this sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.789" end="00:29:20.839" style="s2">there is a teleology to this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.469" end="00:29:22.700" style="s2">conversation there is a direction to</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.700" end="00:29:29.209" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;ve been very aware in with</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.369" style="s2">rebel wisdom and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.209" end="00:29:36.440" style="s2">we&#39;re hoping to get more and more in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.369" end="00:29:37.969" style="s2">position to to influence as well and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.440" end="00:29:41.029" style="s2">mentioned Jordan Greenville Jordan green</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.969" end="00:29:44.419" style="s2">Hall is one of the certainly one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.029" end="00:29:47.690" style="s2">most fascinating and important thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.419" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">that we found since we&#39;ve been starting</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.690" end="00:29:53.299" style="s2">to follow this thread and it it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:56.359" style="s2">leading in that direction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.299" end="00:29:57.469" style="s2">something that like we said before</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.359" end="00:29:59.059" style="s2">there&#39;s the IDW then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.469" end="00:30:02.029" style="s2">emerging conversation it&#39;s under the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.059" end="00:30:05.179" style="s2">underneath it and I think that I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.029" end="00:30:07.129" style="s2">love to see that kind of that grouping</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.179" end="00:30:09.349" style="s2">extender to include people like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.129" end="00:30:12.589" style="s2">green Hall include people like Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.349" end="00:30:15.289" style="s2">Weil who I think is is holding a really</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.589" end="00:30:20.509" style="s2">vital piece Jamie wheal wrote stealing</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.289" end="00:30:22.129" style="s2">fire and is a flow state&#39;s experts what</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.509" end="00:30:24.229" style="s2">I thought what I find with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.129" end="00:30:26.959" style="s2">Greenhalgh and with Jamie wheel is there</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.229" end="00:30:30.139" style="s2">they&#39;re both bringing this deep felt</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.959" end="00:30:31.549" style="s2">sense of the liminal yeah and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.139" end="00:30:33.289" style="s2">something that can&#39;t be faked</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.549" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">I&#39;ll add Daniel Shmack Tim burger into</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.289" end="00:30:41.570" style="s2">that as well it&#39;s really deep felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:43.429" style="s2">of speaking from a liminal space and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.570" end="00:30:45.049" style="s2">do we collectively go into that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.429" end="00:30:49.609" style="s2">space where the right answers will</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.049" end="00:30:51.379" style="s2">emerge regulars without that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.609" end="00:30:53.419" style="s2">think we&#39;re going to get through and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.379" end="00:30:55.070" style="s2">think that&#39;s the crucial that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.419" end="00:30:57.529" style="s2">crucial thing that we need to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.070" end="00:31:00.619" style="s2">learn to get into this into subjective</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.529" end="00:31:01.999" style="s2">sense making and what prevents you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.619" end="00:31:04.669" style="s2">getting into it is thinking that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.999" end="00:31:07.340" style="s2">already know the answers yes and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.669" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">a so what we&#39;re looking at then</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.340" end="00:31:10.730" style="s2">one of the embodied practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:13.910" style="s2">able to put us into a state of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.730" end="00:31:15.980" style="s2">sovereignty into a state of allowing</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.910" end="00:31:18.200" style="s2">ourselves to be wrong allowing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.980" end="00:31:19.460" style="s2">to give up and this is again going back</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.200" end="00:31:22.130" style="s2">to Jordan Peters and I think it says</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.460" end="00:31:24.800" style="s2">that beautifully about allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.130" end="00:31:27.110" style="s2">deadwood to be burnt off hmm there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.800" end="00:31:28.700" style="s2">something really vital about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.110" end="00:31:32.120" style="s2">genuinely get into this space of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.700" end="00:31:33.560" style="s2">intersubjective sense-making and and how</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.120" end="00:31:35.690" style="s2">do we do that collectively</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.560" end="00:31:38.030" style="s2">I know that&#39;s that&#39;s really the focus of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.690" end="00:31:40.970" style="s2">jordan green halls work and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.030" end="00:31:43.490" style="s2">something that we it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.970" end="00:31:45.290" style="s2">something that we are attempting to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.490" end="00:31:47.690" style="s2">with rebel wisdom it&#39;s the next it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.290" end="00:31:52.340" style="s2">next stage of the project so we already</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.690" end="00:31:55.700" style="s2">have a an event coming up in in May</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.340" end="00:31:57.650" style="s2">called the summit where we we already we</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.700" end="00:32:00.460" style="s2">have Jordan green Hall Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.650" end="00:32:02.860" style="s2">Heather hi Andy and McGilchrist who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.460" end="00:32:05.030" style="s2">tremendous thinkers in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.860" end="00:32:08.480" style="s2">hopefully demonstrating on stage</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.030" end="00:32:10.070" style="s2">entering into thinking in public</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.480" end="00:32:12.710" style="s2">demonstrating this kind of inter</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.070" end="00:32:15.170" style="s2">subjective process themselves and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.710" end="00:32:16.340" style="s2">we&#39;re also we have a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.170" end="00:32:18.740" style="s2">guests and we&#39;re going to break them</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.340" end="00:32:20.510" style="s2">into small groups and and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.740" end="00:32:24.110" style="s2">facilitate them to get into that space</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.510" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">themselves as well that&#39;s fantastic and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.110" end="00:32:30.260" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how how directed are you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:33.320" style="s2">being in terms of like is there a goal</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.260" end="00:32:34.850" style="s2">for harnessing that collective</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.320" end="00:32:36.230" style="s2">intelligence that I imagine the 150</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.850" end="00:32:39.920" style="s2">people that make their way to your event</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.230" end="00:32:42.710" style="s2">will be pretty interesting people</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.920" end="00:32:45.860" style="s2">capable hopefully of doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.710" end="00:32:46.970" style="s2">work you know yes what&#39;s the what what</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.860" end="00:32:48.560" style="s2">do you are you attempting to produce</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.970" end="00:32:51.740" style="s2">anything there&#39;s a more proof of concept</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.560" end="00:32:53.560" style="s2">or what&#39;s the it is kind of proof of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.740" end="00:32:58.370" style="s2">concept we&#39;ve done it a few times</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.560" end="00:33:01.030" style="s2">already in smaller events and this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.370" end="00:33:02.990" style="s2">the largest one that we&#39;ll have done and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.030" end="00:33:10.310" style="s2">exactly at the Dunbar number it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.990" end="00:33:13.880" style="s2">perfect yeah that&#39;s interesting yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.310" end="00:33:18.140" style="s2">is it is a kind of proof of concept in</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.880" end="00:33:22.010" style="s2">some ways and what I think we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.140" end="00:33:25.380" style="s2">is establish and create a field</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.010" end="00:33:27.900" style="s2">which works a community of people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.380" end="00:33:30.060" style="s2">are doing this together I think the UK</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.900" end="00:33:33.570" style="s2">is a good place to do that for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.060" end="00:33:35.220" style="s2">I&#39;m going to later and I think for</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.570" end="00:33:38.540" style="s2">various cultural reasons we have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:41.100" style="s2">chance of avoiding the kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.540" end="00:33:43.190" style="s2">instant polarization that we seem to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.100" end="00:33:45.830" style="s2">in America whenever something happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.190" end="00:33:47.850" style="s2">there is a there&#39;s just this instant</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.830" end="00:33:49.590" style="s2">splitting into two camps</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.850" end="00:33:51.630" style="s2">I think that&#39;s America&#39;s kind of genius</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.590" end="00:33:54.420" style="s2">in some ways is this polarization and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:33:57.240" style="s2">kind of dialectic process but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.420" end="00:33:59.970" style="s2">your your drawback as well and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.240" end="00:34:02.370" style="s2">the UK has a talent for synthesis and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.970" end="00:34:07.160" style="s2">think the way the way I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.370" end="00:34:09.480" style="s2">do it is to build a build a field of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.160" end="00:34:12.150" style="s2">people who are able to enter into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.480" end="00:34:14.790" style="s2">space that can then maintain that space</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.150" end="00:34:19.350" style="s2">against bad actors because I have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.790" end="00:34:23.190" style="s2">feeling that most of the the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.350" end="00:34:25.710" style="s2">that can come in and wreck conversations</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.190" end="00:34:30.750" style="s2">is is done through a kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.710" end="00:34:33.960" style="s2">shaming tactic it&#39;s done through certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.750" end="00:34:37.650" style="s2">keywords and certain key objections that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.960" end="00:34:42.360" style="s2">then look for support within the within</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.650" end="00:34:44.400" style="s2">the group to derail to derail</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.360" end="00:34:48.450" style="s2">conversations and I think if we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.400" end="00:34:50.250" style="s2">build a functioning field where though</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.450" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">and the other thing we&#39;ve done with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.250" end="00:34:56.750" style="s2">with the summit is there&#39;s a sign-up</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:59.370" style="s2">form when you when you sign up that says</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.750" end="00:35:02.100" style="s2">effectively I agree to enter into this</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.370" end="00:35:04.190" style="s2">collaborative process I agree to leave</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.100" end="00:35:07.650" style="s2">my ideology at the door</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.190" end="00:35:09.150" style="s2">etc etc they&#39;d which it&#39;s an idea we got</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.650" end="00:35:12.570" style="s2">from Brett and Heather for how they</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.150" end="00:35:14.310" style="s2">managed to to do their conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.570" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">evergreen because the other thing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.310" end="00:35:19.410" style="s2">realize about Brett and Heather is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:21.870" style="s2">both evolutionary biologists talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.410" end="00:35:24.390" style="s2">about the reality of biological sex</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.870" end="00:35:26.130" style="s2">differences all of these topics that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.390" end="00:35:29.340" style="s2">have become incredibly difficult to talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.130" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">about in in and around the modern left</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.340" end="00:35:33.570" style="s2">and they were doing this in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:35.490" style="s2">most progressive colleges probably the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.570" end="00:35:38.190" style="s2">most progressive college in America</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.490" end="00:35:43.410" style="s2">and they managed to teach there for over</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.190" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">a decade with no complaints no like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.410" end="00:35:47.160" style="s2">they&#39;ve mastered it the people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">protested against them were not their</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.160" end="00:35:53.010" style="s2">own students one of the ways they did it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">was to get people to sign up to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.010" end="00:35:58.290" style="s2">covenant when they entered into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:36:01.320" style="s2">class as that says people are on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.290" end="00:36:03.900" style="s2">massive hair-trigger for any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.320" end="00:36:06.589" style="s2">exclusion so the only way to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.900" end="00:36:09.089" style="s2">that is to turn around that issue into</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.589" end="00:36:12.660" style="s2">these are the ground rules you&#39;ve signed</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.089" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">up for if you choose not to obey them</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.660" end="00:36:19.580" style="s2">you&#39;re excluding yourself hmm so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">only way to do it is to have a set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.580" end="00:36:24.330" style="s2">ground rules and then to have some way</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:27.450" style="s2">of enforcing those so someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.330" end="00:36:30.150" style="s2">willing to enforce those as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.450" end="00:36:31.950" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s what strikes me in</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.150" end="00:36:33.660" style="s2">hearing you describe your intentions for</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.950" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">the event and and for rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.660" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">moving forward is it&#39;s a really big</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:43.859" style="s2">shift in the purpose of broadcast media</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.450" style="s2">right like I think if I&#39;m gonna use a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.859" end="00:36:47.910" style="s2">sort of simplified picture of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.450" end="00:36:49.260" style="s2">broadcast media has been used for in</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.910" end="00:36:51.990" style="s2">recent history it&#39;s been to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.260" end="00:36:54.060" style="s2">amplify a particular ideology so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:36:57.450" style="s2">people can make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.060" end="00:36:58.920" style="s2">according to that ideology whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.450" end="00:37:01.020" style="s2">know with rebel wisdom and these this</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.920" end="00:37:03.270" style="s2">whole conversational space is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.020" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">invitation for individuals to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.270" end="00:37:09.270" style="s2">responsibility for their own sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:11.940" style="s2">making and their own ability to move</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.270" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">through the world with their autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.940" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">and sovereignty or however you want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">frame it and so it&#39;s fascinating to hear</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:24.510" style="s2">how you&#39;re exploring this kind of edge</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:26.430" style="s2">where you&#39;re using broadcast media right</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.510" end="00:37:27.780" style="s2">you&#39;re doing things that are you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">producing it and you&#39;re sending it out</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.780" end="00:37:33.390" style="s2">to millions of brains but the N you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:36.359" style="s2">trying to make that flip so that those</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.390" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">brains look down from their devices turn</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.359" end="00:37:42.630" style="s2">off listening to some expert yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:44.609" style="s2">a tricky that&#39;s a tricky move to make I</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.630" end="00:37:46.890" style="s2">imagine because people really like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.609" end="00:37:49.459" style="s2">really like you know just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.890" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">other people talk and tell me how it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.459" end="00:37:58.440" style="s2">yeah but there is also a huge desire for</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:38:00.719" style="s2">spaces for people to to converse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.440" end="00:38:03.599" style="s2">something we&#39;ve really noticed when we</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.719" end="00:38:07.199" style="s2">when we bring the that space in and our</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:09.059" style="s2">live events and ask people to to express</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.199" end="00:38:11.130" style="s2">themselves there&#39;s a huge buzz in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.059" end="00:38:14.059" style="s2">room there&#39;s this mmm there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.130" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">hunger for people to express themselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.059" end="00:38:20.969" style="s2">but there is also it&#39;s a very delicate</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:24.359" style="s2">balance to hold because it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.969" end="00:38:26.099" style="s2">to slip back in to see I would say this</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.359" end="00:38:27.390" style="s2">has happened in America with the with</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.099" end="00:38:32.119" style="s2">the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.390" end="00:38:34.559" style="s2">it was framed as a space for brain</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.119" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">conversations beyond polarization but</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.559" end="00:38:39.150" style="s2">has become a polarizing force in itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:42.719" style="s2">someone is either for or against the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.150" end="00:38:45.930" style="s2">and in some sense as soon as it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.719" end="00:38:48.809" style="s2">named in the New York Times the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.930" end="00:38:50.390" style="s2">was it then became defined as a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.809" end="00:38:53.699" style="s2">that you were either for or against</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.390" end="00:38:55.949" style="s2">uh-huh it&#39;s very difficult I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.699" end="00:38:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what happens in America I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.949" end="00:39:01.650" style="s2">think it it&#39;s almost impossible in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.559" end="00:39:04.769" style="s2">America to avoid that trap as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.650" end="00:39:06.359" style="s2">you define something you&#39;re then either</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.769" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">for or against it and you just get</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.359" end="00:39:11.039" style="s2">pulled back into the same polarization</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:13.380" style="s2">trap I don&#39;t like the idea as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.039" end="00:39:15.150" style="s2">phenomenon has not been polarized in</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.380" end="00:39:16.680" style="s2">that way in the UK because I just</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.150" end="00:39:18.239" style="s2">assumed that that was I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.680" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">enough people are aware of it for it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.239" end="00:39:21.930" style="s2">have been polarized that way in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:26.069" style="s2">okay interesting interesting interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.930" end="00:39:28.890" style="s2">but yeah I mean Jordan Peterson the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.069" end="00:39:31.079" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re there already if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.890" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">in the u.s. that they put you on one</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.079" end="00:39:36.089" style="s2">side of the cultural war by definition</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:40.489" style="s2">oh yeah and it seems very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.089" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">avoid that process happening yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.489" end="00:39:46.829" style="s2">yeah I would direct people I&#39;d direct</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:49.529" style="s2">people there&#39;s one there&#39;s one interview</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.829" end="00:39:51.390" style="s2">that we&#39;ve done I think we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.529" end="00:39:54.239" style="s2">with Jordan green Hall and we called it</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.390" end="00:39:56.430" style="s2">the intellectual dark web and genuine</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.239" end="00:40:00.930" style="s2">conversation I think it was called well</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.430" end="00:40:02.820" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the nearest we&#39;ve come me</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.930" end="00:40:04.290" style="s2">in Jordan at</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.820" end="00:40:07.700" style="s2">entering into that collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.290" end="00:40:11.190" style="s2">sense-making process on camera hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.700" end="00:40:13.470" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly true that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.190" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">aspiration as much as it is a reality at</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.470" end="00:40:20.210" style="s2">the moment to to have those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:22.830" style="s2">conversations but I think the first step</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.210" end="00:40:24.950" style="s2">the first step really is identifying the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.830" end="00:40:28.920" style="s2">people who are able to enter into them</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.950" end="00:40:34.500" style="s2">yes again once you&#39;ve done that bringing</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.920" end="00:40:36.420" style="s2">them together and that&#39;s what I think a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.500" end="00:40:38.520" style="s2">lot of people were very hungry for when</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.420" end="00:40:42.680" style="s2">the intellectual darkweb first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.520" end="00:40:47.940" style="s2">broke cover earlier in 2018 if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.680" end="00:40:51.630" style="s2">the conversation between Brett Eric on</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.940" end="00:40:55.620" style="s2">the Dave Rubin show and Peterson and Ben</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.630" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">Shapiro amazingly and this was about</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.620" end="00:41:01.290" style="s2">they were talking about religion and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:03.930" style="s2">think it was it was pretty much Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:06.690" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro both</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.930" end="00:41:09.390" style="s2">following this real thread of their on</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.690" end="00:41:11.360" style="s2">their understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.390" end="00:41:13.650" style="s2">judeo-christian framework and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.360" end="00:41:17.010" style="s2">Jordans understanding was able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.650" end="00:41:18.360" style="s2">include Ben Shapiro&#39;s and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.010" end="00:41:22.380" style="s2">real sense of intellectual engagement</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.360" end="00:41:25.050" style="s2">and connection and and and ability to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.380" end="00:41:27.120" style="s2">come to a sort of a greater synthesis in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.050" end="00:41:28.860" style="s2">that conversation that was really</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.120" end="00:41:30.030" style="s2">exciting and you kind of that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.860" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">think people were really excited about</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.030" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">was this sense of it&#39;s an alive</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:36.030" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s definitely going</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:38.130" style="s2">somewhere and there&#39;s an ability of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.030" end="00:41:39.870" style="s2">everyone to enter into this whether</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.130" end="00:41:41.670" style="s2">someone like Ben Shapiro is able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.870" end="00:41:45.750" style="s2">enter into that same conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.670" end="00:41:48.780" style="s2">something like name a hot cultural war</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.750" end="00:41:51.600" style="s2">topic abortion rights or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.780" end="00:41:55.620" style="s2">rather than Ben Shapiro destroys</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.600" end="00:41:57.840" style="s2">leftists snowflake etc etc etc who knows</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.620" end="00:41:59.810" style="s2">but there was certainly a quality and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.840" end="00:42:04.470" style="s2">lot of those conversations that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.810" end="00:42:06.630" style="s2">genuinely emergent and genuinely and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.470" end="00:42:08.010" style="s2">comes and goes as well I think some</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.630" end="00:42:10.830" style="s2">conversations have that and some</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.010" end="00:42:15.470" style="s2">conversations don&#39;t it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.830" end="00:42:15.470" style="s2">process you could use a good analogy is</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.260" end="00:42:22.520" style="s2">improv comedy mm-hmm one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.650" end="00:42:24.750" style="s2">rules of improv comedy is always yes and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.520" end="00:42:26.820" style="s2">that whenever you&#39;re doing a scene in</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.750" end="00:42:29.670" style="s2">improv comedy if someone brings</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.820" end="00:42:31.740" style="s2">something in you don&#39;t say they say oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.670" end="00:42:34.650" style="s2">we&#39;re on a fire engine you don&#39;t say no</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.740" end="00:42:36.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s a spaceship you say yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.650" end="00:42:40.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a fire engine and it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.740" end="00:42:44.580" style="s2">penguin driving it and it because if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.740" end="00:42:48.180" style="s2">don&#39;t kill the scene and so it&#39;s a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.580" end="00:42:51.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a really crucial value to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.180" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">to any conversation is a yes and which</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.150" end="00:42:56.250" style="s2">is something I&#39;ve tried to do from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:58.590" style="s2">beginning with rebel wisdom to say yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.250" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">and to Jordan Pederson for example we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.590" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">done a couple of shows the Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:07.950" style="s2">paradox and the Peterson synthesis where</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:09.690" style="s2">we we had some criticisms of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.950" end="00:43:11.220" style="s2">Pederson I think there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.690" end="00:43:14.700" style="s2">he can be criticized on but I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.220" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve done it from a place of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.700" end="00:43:18.750" style="s2">appreciation for the value that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:22.830" style="s2">bringing and the space that he&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.750" end="00:43:25.740" style="s2">and and the the skill that he has which</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.830" end="00:43:27.510" style="s2">is why and I think that value of yes and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.740" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">is why we&#39;ve been able to have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.510" end="00:43:34.260" style="s2">success that we&#39;ve had so far</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:35.730" style="s2">hmm yeah well and and so I also had or</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.260" end="00:43:37.619" style="s2">at least attempted to have one of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.730" end="00:43:40.230" style="s2">maybe we can call them generative</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.619" end="00:43:43.740" style="s2">conversations with Jordan green Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.230" end="00:43:45.869" style="s2">and somebody named Bonita Roy who I love</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.740" end="00:43:47.490" style="s2">and I suggest you speak with her if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.869" end="00:43:50.220" style="s2">haven&#39;t already for rebel ism she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.490" end="00:43:54.030" style="s2">incredible person exploring exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.220" end="00:43:56.340" style="s2">space and what was striking to me is how</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.030" end="00:43:59.420" style="s2">difficult it is to have these</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.340" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">conversations and how systematically</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.420" end="00:44:06.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve been trained not in in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:11.420" style="s2">opposite of the skill set that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.750" end="00:44:14.930" style="s2">to have open minded generative synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.420" end="00:44:17.790" style="s2">improvisational discourse mmm and so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.930" end="00:44:19.830" style="s2">remember when in the conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.790" end="00:44:22.050" style="s2">Jordan you know one of the first things</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.830" end="00:44:23.430" style="s2">he said was you got to figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.050" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">somebody they were speaking with is</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:28.150" style="s2">actually capable of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:33.100" style="s2">doing this thing that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.150" end="00:44:35.110" style="s2">about mmm and so you know III guess what</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.100" end="00:44:37.480" style="s2">comes to mind is the other work that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.110" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">you&#39;re doing around retreats and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.480" end="00:44:42.520" style="s2">workshops you know it makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:44.740" style="s2">now at this point in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.520" end="00:44:49.720" style="s2">the the connection between those two</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.740" end="00:44:51.400" style="s2">elements of your work right I mean if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.720" end="00:44:53.260" style="s2">need to have these generative discourses</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.400" end="00:44:54.700" style="s2">as a civilization in order to really</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.260" end="00:44:56.890" style="s2">kind of quote-unquote make it through</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.700" end="00:45:00.580" style="s2">this I have the needle that we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.890" end="00:45:02.260" style="s2">up to then we we need we need to unlearn</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.580" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">a lot of things and we need to learn a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.260" end="00:45:07.710" style="s2">lot of things and we need to do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:10.420" style="s2">pretty quick it seems like yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.710" end="00:45:11.830" style="s2">yeah that just kind of clicked for me it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.420" end="00:45:13.570" style="s2">makes sense now the whole kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.830" end="00:45:16.030" style="s2">guess that the larger business model or</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.570" end="00:45:20.230" style="s2">the larger operating of rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.030" end="00:45:25.030" style="s2">yeah I think yeah I&#39;m certainly feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.230" end="00:45:27.880" style="s2">the the pressure of time I think since</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.030" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">the Trump election I had a I had a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.880" end="00:45:36.280" style="s2">feeling that he was going to get elected</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:37.720" style="s2">and I had a very strong sense of for</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.280" end="00:45:40.600" style="s2">quite a long time had a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.720" end="00:45:42.010" style="s2">sense that this kind of these structures</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.600" end="00:45:43.870" style="s2">that we&#39;re taking for granted are</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.010" end="00:45:46.630" style="s2">nowhere near as stable as we think they</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.870" end="00:45:48.370" style="s2">are and and the things have the chance</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.630" end="00:45:52.680" style="s2">have the potential to kind of go south</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.370" end="00:45:56.110" style="s2">very quickly and I certainly feel that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.680" end="00:45:58.900" style="s2">and and yeah that that is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.110" end="00:46:01.800" style="s2">we need is we need to develop these</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.900" end="00:46:06.520" style="s2">skills into subjective generative</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.800" end="00:46:09.010" style="s2">emergent dialogue very very urgently and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.520" end="00:46:10.750" style="s2">I think everyone else in this space I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.010" end="00:46:14.770" style="s2">know Jamie wheel feels this very keenly</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.750" end="00:46:17.400" style="s2">as well Jordan green Hall I&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.770" end="00:46:20.890" style="s2">add brett weinstein to that as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.400" end="00:46:22.360" style="s2">recognizes how difficult this project is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.890" end="00:46:27.150" style="s2">and how we&#39;re kind of threading the eye</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.360" end="00:46:27.150" style="s2">of a needle in some sense mmm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.570" end="00:46:32.180" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.240" end="00:46:34.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not an easy thing to do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.180" end="00:46:35.690" style="s2">very easy to come out of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.100" end="00:46:37.150" style="s2">Greenhalgh talks about sovereignty when</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.690" end="00:46:39.320" style="s2">we&#39;re in sovereignty and when we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.150" end="00:46:41.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a few people that I think should</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.320" end="00:46:45.230" style="s2">be brought into the conversation as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.000" end="00:46:49.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s this work that&#39;s been done</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.230" end="00:46:53.119" style="s2">in in Euro I guess you call it neuro</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.990" end="00:46:56.090" style="s2">neurobiology around something called</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:46:59.090" style="s2">polyvagal theory and somatic work which</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.090" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">completely revolutionized the the work</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.090" end="00:47:04.610" style="s2">of transformation or kind of the more</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:08.619" style="s2">personal growth work that we do where we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.610" end="00:47:11.090" style="s2">realize now a lot more about trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.619" end="00:47:14.119" style="s2">trauma is defined as anything we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.090" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">able to integrate and this this</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.119" end="00:47:20.590" style="s2">realization that the the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">the vagus nerve in moderating our</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.590" end="00:47:25.670" style="s2">sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:26.900" style="s2">system we are either I don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.670" end="00:47:28.850" style="s2">too much into the science of it but</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.900" end="00:47:31.670" style="s2">effectively we are either in an</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.850" end="00:47:34.369" style="s2">exploratory framework or we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.670" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">defensive framework and if we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.369" end="00:47:39.080" style="s2">defensive framework we are unavailable</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:40.670" style="s2">we&#39;re unavailable for inquiry we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.080" end="00:47:42.080" style="s2">unavailable for curiosity were</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.670" end="00:47:45.230" style="s2">unavailable for dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.080" end="00:47:46.910" style="s2">whereas if we&#39;re in the the more</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.230" end="00:47:48.920" style="s2">positive space I need to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.910" end="00:47:50.750" style="s2">about this as well I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.920" end="00:47:52.940" style="s2">the edge of my my knowledge but I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.750" end="00:47:55.600" style="s2">to talk to two of the guys who who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.940" end="00:47:59.240" style="s2">done this work if we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.600" end="00:48:01.820" style="s2">exploratory framework that&#39;s when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.240" end="00:48:06.470" style="s2">curious when we&#39;re inquiring when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.820" end="00:48:08.450" style="s2">in a space of genuine and we do this in</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.470" end="00:48:10.490" style="s2">our workshops as well we call it inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.450" end="00:48:12.590" style="s2">and we ask people sort of close your</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.490" end="00:48:14.450" style="s2">eyes going be curious about what you</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.590" end="00:48:17.420" style="s2">find be curious about what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.450" end="00:48:20.690" style="s2">your life talk to this other person and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.420" end="00:48:22.910" style="s2">come from a space of genuine inquiry why</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.690" end="00:48:23.930" style="s2">do I do this well I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.910" end="00:48:25.550" style="s2">thought about how these things fit</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.930" end="00:48:26.930" style="s2">together before I never realize that</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.550" end="00:48:30.170" style="s2">this might be a reason that I do this</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.930" end="00:48:32.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s an absolutely essential skill</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.170" end="00:48:34.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s one that we have to very</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.359" end="00:48:35.720" style="s2">consciously develop and there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.340" end="00:48:37.580" style="s2">various other ways of doing that as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.720" end="00:48:39.640" style="s2">I know maybe other listeners to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.580" end="00:48:42.260" style="s2">have heard of something called circling</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.640" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">circling is a practice that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.260" end="00:48:46.850" style="s2">based on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:48.650" style="s2">same principles as inquiry hmm what am i</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.850" end="00:48:50.710" style="s2">feeling what is happening in the space</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.650" end="00:48:55.640" style="s2">that&#39;s arising between us as I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.710" end="00:48:58.850" style="s2">well and being genuinely curious and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:49:02.030" style="s2">that can only happen from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.850" end="00:49:04.780" style="s2">sovereignty in a place of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.030" end="00:49:08.120" style="s2">not being pulled out of that space by a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.780" end="00:49:11.330" style="s2">stuff for want of a better word yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.120" end="00:49:14.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky position to be in because</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.330" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">I&#39;m the one hand I also like you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.300" end="00:49:19.550" style="s2">mentioned I feel this urgency like it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:22.610" style="s2">does feel like time is running out and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.550" end="00:49:25.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know how true that is or if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.610" end="00:49:27.380" style="s2">just a sense and I invite anybody</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.340" end="00:49:29.420" style="s2">listening to come and tell me why I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.380" end="00:49:32.390" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t feel that way I would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.420" end="00:49:34.220" style="s2">not to feel that way actually but</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.390" end="00:49:35.570" style="s2">nonetheless I do feel that way right now</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.220" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s no sense that time is</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.570" end="00:49:41.570" style="s2">running out and and yet it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:43.130" style="s2">like all these thinkers and and in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.570" end="00:49:43.610" style="s2">own experience and I&#39;m hearing this from</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.130" end="00:49:46.100" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.610" end="00:49:47.690" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of triangulating towards we</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.100" end="00:49:51.170" style="s2">actually have to go really slow now and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.690" end="00:49:53.830" style="s2">be really curious and exploratory and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.170" end="00:49:58.490" style="s2">open and generative and it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.830" end="00:50:00.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a very tricky chasm to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.490" end="00:50:06.620" style="s2">lock down like on either side you fall</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.710" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">over and it&#39;s a needle before yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.620" end="00:50:14.330" style="s2">it is very much so like threading a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">needle and I guess this is a mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.330" end="00:50:18.710" style="s2">to hear your thoughts on this are you</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:24.500" style="s2">are you optimistic I am I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.710" end="00:50:28.190" style="s2">think it goes back to Star Wars Luke in</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.500" end="00:50:31.190" style="s2">Star Wars feeling the force kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.190" end="00:50:32.990" style="s2">taking away his guidance system I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.190" end="00:50:39.230" style="s2">that is a modern myth that&#39;s our modern</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.990" end="00:50:41.570" style="s2">religion so it&#39;s got to be true there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.230" end="00:50:45.470" style="s2">there&#39;s I mean I Lyla I laugh it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.570" end="00:50:46.910" style="s2">of a I&#39;m being only slightly facetious I</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.470" end="00:50:49.880" style="s2">do think that there is something in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.910" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">I do think there&#39;s something in yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.880" end="00:50:52.940" style="s2">need to gain access to that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:55.580" style="s2">space we need to gain access to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.940" end="00:50:56.810" style="s2">space that that knows what to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.580" end="00:50:59.420" style="s2">knows what what is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.810" end="00:51:03.050" style="s2">propria to the times and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.420" end="00:51:05.630" style="s2">unless we&#39;re acting from that space then</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.050" end="00:51:08.440" style="s2">I think whatever we bring forth is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.630" end="00:51:12.620" style="s2">going to be equal to the times hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.440" end="00:51:15.290" style="s2">then and I also feel certainly that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.620" end="00:51:17.810" style="s2">sense of time running out it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.290" end="00:51:19.790" style="s2">helped when some of the most intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.810" end="00:51:24.260" style="s2">people we&#39;ve interviewed have are also</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.790" end="00:51:27.020" style="s2">saying the same thing but also it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.260" end="00:51:28.010" style="s2">what is I as a journalist I look around</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.020" end="00:51:31.400" style="s2">at the world and I see so many</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.010" end="00:51:33.080" style="s2">existential threats that that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.400" end="00:51:35.510" style="s2">I mean at the moment a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.080" end="00:51:39.080" style="s2">focusing primarily on the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.510" end="00:51:42.440" style="s2">threat yeah but I I look at I look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.080" end="00:51:43.670" style="s2">world politics I look at kind of where</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.440" end="00:51:46.460" style="s2">we&#39;re still only halfway through the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.670" end="00:51:52.730" style="s2">Trump presidency I mean I I just see so</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.460" end="00:51:54.020" style="s2">many threats that on on the horizon that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.730" end="00:51:57.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to get kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.020" end="00:52:02.810" style="s2">overwhelmed by any particular one mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.080" end="00:52:05.480" style="s2">yeah right well yeah I want to go too</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.810" end="00:52:12.140" style="s2">far into the existential risk rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.480" end="00:52:15.200" style="s2">hole yeah I just know enough to be very</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.140" end="00:52:16.730" style="s2">worried I mean I know we we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.200" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">interacted online around this as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.730" end="00:52:24.860" style="s2">like Pam yeah I&#39;m concerned at how</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:26.900" style="s2">neatly so many of so much of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.860" end="00:52:30.140" style="s2">apocalyptic thinking maps on to the deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.900" end="00:52:33.590" style="s2">religious framework yeah yeah yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.140" end="00:52:35.000" style="s2">seen you mention that yeah well describe</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.590" end="00:52:36.080" style="s2">your position on that because I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.000" end="00:52:41.900" style="s2">to talk to you a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.080" end="00:52:43.850" style="s2">all I would I mean I don&#39;t know the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.900" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">not a climate scientist for example so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.850" end="00:52:48.020" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go too deeply into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:51.560" style="s2">science or express an opinion about that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.020" end="00:52:53.210" style="s2">but I would say I don&#39;t see many people</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.560" end="00:52:56.840" style="s2">coming forward with what I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.210" end="00:52:59.930" style="s2">consider to be an integral or a balance</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.840" end="00:53:00.650" style="s2">framework around climate change for</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.930" end="00:53:04.120" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.650" end="00:53:06.590" style="s2">and I&#39;m which I think would acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.120" end="00:53:09.830" style="s2">certainly how neatly it fits on to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.590" end="00:53:10.550" style="s2">very sort of religious framework we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.830" end="00:53:12.410" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.550" end="00:53:13.970" style="s2">we&#39;re all doomed we need to repent right</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.410" end="00:53:16.010" style="s2">now yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.970" end="00:53:18.170" style="s2">is it genuinely about climate change or</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.010" end="00:53:19.430" style="s2">is it about changing people if you heard</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.170" end="00:53:22.310" style="s2">that there&#39;s a technological solution</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.430" end="00:53:24.920" style="s2">tomorrow for climate change how would</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.310" end="00:53:26.270" style="s2">that make you feel will you be relieved</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.920" end="00:53:27.800" style="s2">or would you actually think no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.270" end="00:53:30.260" style="s2">not the point the point is that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.800" end="00:53:32.030" style="s2">need to stop being selfish they need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.260" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">stop being disrespectful to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.030" end="00:53:37.790" style="s2">environment to stop being etc etc what</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:40.820" style="s2">what&#39;s the deeper it is it about</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.790" end="00:53:42.500" style="s2">changing people or is it about changing</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.820" end="00:53:43.970" style="s2">the environment I mean that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.500" end="00:53:46.700" style="s2">that&#39;d be one suggestion but the other</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.970" end="00:53:48.380" style="s2">the other key thing I mentioned an</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.700" end="00:53:53.740" style="s2">integral framework for me that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.380" end="00:53:56.150" style="s2">to say yes there are all of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.740" end="00:54:00.860" style="s2">factors that are pushing us towards</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.150" end="00:54:05.450" style="s2">apocalyptic thinking on on this subject</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.860" end="00:54:07.790" style="s2">and yet yes right because I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.450" end="00:54:10.730" style="s2">much acknowledgement this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.790" end="00:54:12.680" style="s2">this sort of pseudo naivety among people</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.730" end="00:54:14.840" style="s2">I&#39;d say sort of a more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.680" end="00:54:19.070" style="s2">apocalyptic on on climate stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.840" end="00:54:20.990" style="s2">that seems to say no everything settled</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.070" end="00:54:22.990" style="s2">science is science is completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.990" end="00:54:25.730" style="s2">objective it&#39;s like so enter the human</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.990" end="00:54:27.530" style="s2">is a human endeavor like anything else</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.730" end="00:54:30.290" style="s2">grant money is given for certain things</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.530" end="00:54:33.650" style="s2">I know how the media works there are big</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.290" end="00:54:35.210" style="s2">institutional biases yes towards a</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.650" end="00:54:37.370" style="s2">certain narrative and towards groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.210" end="00:54:40.670" style="s2">on these things I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.370" end="00:54:43.990" style="s2">wrong but I would like to hear people</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.670" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">acknowledge that and say but still I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.990" end="00:54:46.760" style="s2">believe this because of this this or</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:48.410" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.760" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">and I don&#39;t see that I don&#39;t see an</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.410" end="00:54:53.600" style="s2">ability to hold that complexity among a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:55.370" style="s2">lot of people in this space and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.600" end="00:54:56.600" style="s2">really honest the people that I see with</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.370" end="00:54:59.600" style="s2">the ability to hold that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.600" end="00:55:04.190" style="s2">complexity I often find coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.600" end="00:55:07.550" style="s2">place of less apocalyptic rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.190" end="00:55:09.890" style="s2">around climate specifically that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.550" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">to say there are not other kind of big</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.890" end="00:55:15.530" style="s2">existential threats as well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.960" style="s2">well and I&#39;ve had a lot of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.530" end="00:55:21.470" style="s2">on the podcast and some more coming up</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.960" end="00:55:23.790" style="s2">about existential risk and climate</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.470" end="00:55:27.190" style="s2">collapse and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.790" end="00:55:30.430" style="s2">very real spectres and at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.190" end="00:55:32.980" style="s2">in our in our psyches and and for me the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.430" end="00:55:34.510" style="s2">the through line for this entire</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.980" end="00:55:38.710" style="s2">conversation we&#39;ve been having is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.510" end="00:55:41.650" style="s2">if you&#39;re certain about it then you shut</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.710" end="00:55:44.350" style="s2">down so much of what&#39;s needed in any</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.650" end="00:55:45.670" style="s2">case like it&#39;s not like it&#39;s gonna be an</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.350" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">apocalypse and all sudden you just cease</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.670" end="00:55:49.360" style="s2">to exist like things are gonna change</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:53.080" style="s2">rapidly and you&#39;re going to be called</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.360" end="00:55:55.930" style="s2">forth to respond in ways that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.080" end="00:55:57.220" style="s2">even know about right or like things</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.930" end="00:55:59.530" style="s2">will get better and you&#39;ll play a part</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.220" end="00:56:01.840" style="s2">in that or we but we just don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.530" end="00:56:05.020" style="s2">so that the boring thing is to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.840" end="00:56:09.340" style="s2">certain yeah and the only honest answer</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.020" end="00:56:13.450" style="s2">is to just be more deeply uncertain or</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.340" end="00:56:16.570" style="s2">at least you know reasonably uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.450" end="00:56:18.730" style="s2">like just like and that and that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.570" end="00:56:20.920" style="s2">open that space of possibility which I</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.730" end="00:56:23.530" style="s2">think you know from our conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.920" end="00:56:25.420" style="s2">feel more like that&#39;s really a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.530" end="00:56:27.490" style="s2">the gift of the IDW is that they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.420" end="00:56:30.810" style="s2">opening up this space of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.490" end="00:56:34.180" style="s2">where something new can be born yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.810" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">the the lesson if anything is beware of</p>

<p begin="00:57:43.050" end="00:57:52.110" style="s2">what kind of yeah what because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.870" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">a kind of catch-22 because by framing</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.640" end="00:58:07.320" style="s2">seriously you are a Noir on the side of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.400" end="00:58:09.690" style="s2">the extermination of life on Earth</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.320" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;ve curious you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.690" end="00:58:13.020" style="s2">in the UK and I&#39;ve been watching the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.640" end="00:58:15.480" style="s2">development of the extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.020" end="00:58:18.210" style="s2">do you have any kind of commentary on</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.480" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">that any perspective on that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.210" end="00:58:22.020" style="s2">I was thinking I I was aware as I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:24.690" style="s2">talking you guys it hasn&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.020" end="00:58:27.750" style="s2">broken cover quite as much in the US as</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.690" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">it has in the UK so extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.750" end="00:58:39.900" style="s2">is a kind of grassroots Climate movement</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:42.120" style="s2">that has a very yeah I find a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.900" end="00:58:45.150" style="s2">things that they do I found I find their</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.120" end="00:58:47.370" style="s2">use of skulls very troubling they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.150" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">lot they use a lot of iconography based</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.370" end="00:58:52.740" style="s2">around skulls and if I kind of look back</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:55.470" style="s2">at what other organizations in the past</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.740" end="00:58:57.060" style="s2">of sort of driven political movements</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.470" end="00:58:59.780" style="s2">based around skulls I find it very</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.060" end="00:59:02.030" style="s2">interesting that that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.780" end="00:59:04.080" style="s2">iconography that they&#39;re choosing to use</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.030" end="00:59:05.490" style="s2">I&#39;m not sort of saying that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.080" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">never any place for activism there</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.490" end="00:59:11.970" style="s2">clearly is but it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:15.150" style="s2">thing to to inquiry and and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.970" end="00:59:17.580" style="s2">I&#39;m personally interested in and want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.150" end="00:59:20.930" style="s2">kind of see more of yeah I&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.580" end="00:59:23.220" style="s2">get into trouble for the skulls thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.930" end="00:59:24.900" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s curious I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.220" end="00:59:27.660" style="s2">watching it over here I had one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.900" end="00:59:30.870" style="s2">co-founders Gail Bradbrook on the show</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.660" end="00:59:33.120" style="s2">and and at least and and I know because</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.870" end="00:59:35.970" style="s2">I participate in Occupy Wall Street that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.120" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">be there can be a lot of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.970" end="00:59:41.340" style="s2">robustness and nuance in the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:43.770" style="s2">heart of the founders or the instigators</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.340" end="00:59:45.390" style="s2">but then it you know to some degree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.770" end="00:59:49.890" style="s2">out of your hands by the time it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.390" end="00:59:53.400" style="s2">a mass movement and then it can</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.890" end="00:59:54.810" style="s2">go anywhere you know it is in some</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.400" end="00:59:56.220" style="s2">respects a kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.810" end="00:59:59.370" style="s2">intelligence that you don&#39;t have control</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.220" end="01:00:00.990" style="s2">over anymore and so I loved Gale and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.370" end="01:00:04.380" style="s2">thought that she had beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.990" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">perspectives on grieving and the need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:07.500" style="s2">be honest with ourselves about what</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.000" end="01:00:09.570" style="s2">we&#39;re doing to the planet whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.500" end="01:00:11.700" style="s2">were you know destroying it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.570" end="01:00:13.430" style="s2">certainly messing it up pretty bad and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.700" end="01:00:18.690" style="s2">you know like that&#39;s that&#39;s undeniable</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.430" end="01:00:22.260" style="s2">and but then yeah like it can easily</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.690" end="01:00:24.150" style="s2">escape the embrace of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.260" end="01:00:26.070" style="s2">have good intentions who founded it it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.150" end="01:00:28.890" style="s2">also reminds me a little bit of Jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.070" end="01:00:31.710" style="s2">Heights work around the coddling of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.890" end="01:00:34.560" style="s2">American mind where he talked about how</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.710" end="01:00:38.700" style="s2">this culture of kind of microaggressions</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.560" end="01:00:41.120" style="s2">on campus was effectively was really</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.700" end="01:00:43.980" style="s2">count and basically students being told</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.120" end="01:00:45.480" style="s2">always to take things the worst possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.980" end="01:00:47.880" style="s2">way hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.480" end="01:00:50.010" style="s2">was direct and a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.880" end="01:00:52.590" style="s2">reasoning that was coming through in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.010" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">last few years was directly counter to</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.590" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">what you&#39;d be taught in cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:01:00.060" style="s2">behavioral therapy for example which</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:03.720" style="s2">says whenever you have a thought think</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.060" end="01:01:06.270" style="s2">about whether that thought is true what</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.720" end="01:01:08.130" style="s2">that thought means and and just to stop</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.270" end="01:01:10.530" style="s2">yourself catastrophizing most of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.130" end="01:01:12.780" style="s2">time and I do worry that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.530" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">of catastrophizing going on yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.780" end="01:01:17.010" style="s2">personally I&#39;ll just share my</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:22.110" style="s2">perspective on and this is that I kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.010" end="01:01:25.830" style="s2">of choose to act as if extinction is an</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.110" end="01:01:28.050" style="s2">is a real threat because it calls me</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.830" end="01:01:30.660" style="s2">forth to participate in life in a more</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.050" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">beautiful and meaningful way you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.660" end="01:01:35.130" style="s2">like the kind of person that I become</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:39.360" style="s2">when I live in a time when like</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.130" end="01:01:41.460" style="s2">everything&#39;s on the line is more the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.360" end="01:01:42.810" style="s2">person I want to be than the person who</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.460" end="01:01:44.940" style="s2">I would be if I thought that things were</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.810" end="01:01:48.120" style="s2">chill and so there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.940" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">motivated reasoning there on my part but</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.120" end="01:01:51.420" style="s2">I actually think that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:54.810" style="s2">okay like we&#39;re all doing that in our</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.420" end="01:01:59.010" style="s2">own way yes I think I&#39;d agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.810" end="01:02:00.390" style="s2">I think I implicitly feel the same in</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.010" end="01:02:02.000" style="s2">the glitch in the matrix film</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.390" end="01:02:03.609" style="s2">Jordan greenhalgh talked about this</p>

<p begin="01:02:03.609" end="01:02:09.009" style="s2">driven by social media as an existential</p>

<p begin="01:02:22.239" end="01:02:26.920" style="s2">camp and that that splitting was</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.700" end="01:02:30.249" style="s2">existential II was an existential threat</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.920" end="01:02:33.999" style="s2">and I agree I agree with that I feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.249" end="01:02:36.729" style="s2">that we are in the times where the</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.999" end="01:02:41.650" style="s2">stakes are that high and I know that my</p>

<p begin="01:02:45.729" end="01:02:51.789" style="s2">I mean basically what rebel wisdom is is</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.209" end="01:02:58.569" style="s2">an attempt to make to create a sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.789" end="01:03:01.119" style="s2">making framework Network and create the</p>

<p begin="01:03:33.670" end="01:03:38.920" style="s2">work I think and so as we kind of draw</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.599" end="01:03:40.959" style="s2">towards the end of this conversation I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.410" end="01:03:52.059" style="s2">listening no let me think we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.479" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">brought out a few films with ken wilber</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.059" end="01:04:00.999" style="s2">mm-hmm which is something we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:04:03.069" style="s2">mentioned so far but I know that we we</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.999" end="01:04:07.989" style="s2">both share an interesting kind of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.069" end="01:04:10.150" style="s2">framework and it&#39;s something that yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.989" end="01:04:11.799" style="s2">guess I kind of end by saying I do think</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.150" end="01:04:15.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of other perspectives that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.799" end="01:04:17.460" style="s2">I saw the intellectual dark web as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.519" end="01:04:20.260" style="s2">beginnings of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.460" end="01:04:22.120" style="s2">conversation and I do think that there</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.260" end="01:04:25.810" style="s2">are really important voices that need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.120" end="01:04:28.900" style="s2">be added to it and I think for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.810" end="01:04:31.210" style="s2">Ken Wilber in the integral framework</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.900" end="01:04:34.360" style="s2">that he produced was a really important</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.210" end="01:04:37.180" style="s2">map and it&#39;s one that I think Jamie</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.360" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">wheel said to me recently that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.180" end="01:04:43.810" style="s2">people who are currently breaking trail</p>

<p begin="01:04:49.810" end="01:04:53.080" style="s2">just I guess I just heard to be able to</p>
