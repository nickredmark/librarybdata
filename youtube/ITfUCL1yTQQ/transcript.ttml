<p begin="00:01:46.090" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">basic idea is that we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.470" end="00:01:55.930" style="s2">people being existentially trapped and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:58.810" style="s2">that that is a result of them being</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:34.870" style="s2">can be very very damaging it can</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">is also part of what was going on with</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.539" end="00:05:51.889" style="s2">entrapment so you have some higher state</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.570" end="00:05:53.300" style="s2">of consciousness hopefully that has some</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.449" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">been talking about and then you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.010" end="00:06:09.380" style="s2">that in turn set within an important</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.070" end="00:06:38.830" style="s2">the case this is what gnosis is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.060" end="00:06:41.449" style="s2">this kind of deeply transformative deep</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.910" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">on here</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.020" end="00:07:09.760" style="s2">is a project that was addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:12.440" style="s2">dama side that it was still in existence</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.760" end="00:07:14.600" style="s2">persisting from the Hellenistic dama</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.440" end="00:07:16.100" style="s2">side that we were spoken about so also</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.600" end="00:07:18.530" style="s2">as I mentioned one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.100" end="00:07:21.040" style="s2">Christianity took root because while the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.530" end="00:07:23.870" style="s2">Roman Empire offered a socio-political</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.040" end="00:07:25.310" style="s2">solution to some of the problems of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.870" end="00:07:29.419" style="s2">ancient world it didn&#39;t have a viable</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.310" end="00:07:31.310" style="s2">answer on its own to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.419" end="00:07:33.860" style="s2">the dama side of the Hellenistic period</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.310" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">things like stoicism had been generated</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.860" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">but Christianity is a significant</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:43.669" style="s2">response and at the same time this</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:48.500" style="s2">movement this Gnostic movement arises</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.669" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">now these Gnostics many of them not all</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.500" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">of them saw themselves as Christians</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:08:02.840" style="s2">they interpreted Jesus as somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">had brought them gnosis and for them the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.840" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">important thing was not to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.860" end="00:08:15.349" style="s2">Jesus but as much as possible to become</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:19.400" style="s2">like Jesus to go through that&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.349" end="00:08:22.940" style="s2">of radical transformation to be at one</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.400" end="00:08:24.669" style="s2">with God the way Jesus was now whether</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.940" end="00:08:28.310" style="s2">or not we believe in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.669" end="00:08:30.320" style="s2">mythology two things we need to note for</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.419" end="00:08:37.610" style="s2">Gnosticism and Christianity are deeply</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.209" end="00:08:46.459" style="s2">going to see that both Gnosticism and</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.109" end="00:09:26.559" style="s2">interesting about the Gnostics is they</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.389" end="00:09:28.239" style="s2">create a mythology for all of this and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.559" end="00:09:30.939" style="s2">think the best book because if you just</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.239" end="00:09:32.699" style="s2">read their stuff it&#39;s like man it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.939" end="00:09:35.980" style="s2">if you were strung out on an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.699" end="00:09:39.220" style="s2">acid trip and everybody was speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.980" end="00:09:43.359" style="s2">Reverse it is so hard their stuff is so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.220" end="00:09:46.299" style="s2">bizarre and weird and strange but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.359" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">think if you pay attention to some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.299" end="00:09:52.749" style="s2">the main themes of the mythology you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">see how it is a mythological scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.749" end="00:09:58.269" style="s2">for bringing about gnosis a book I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:01.119" style="s2">recommend to you is April the conex book</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.269" end="00:10:02.739" style="s2">the Gnostic new-age in that she does</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.119" end="00:10:05.819" style="s2">some good work at bringing out some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.739" end="00:10:09.249" style="s2">the central themes of this movement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.819" end="00:10:11.399" style="s2">she also points out how much Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.249" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">is prevalent in our culture today</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.399" end="00:10:16.689" style="s2">mythologically and you may say what do</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">you mean by that well many movies and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.689" end="00:10:23.529" style="s2">she chose this in the book actually have</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:25.809" style="s2">a Gnostic theme the the mythology of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.529" end="00:10:29.529" style="s2">movie and movies are where we go to play</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.809" end="00:10:33.549" style="s2">with a lot of our mythology actually are</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.529" end="00:10:35.259" style="s2">a are pretty clear versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.549" end="00:10:38.769" style="s2">gnostic mythology so what is this myth</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.259" end="00:10:42.119" style="s2">this mythology so the Gnostics have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.769" end="00:10:44.589" style="s2">idea and you can see and part of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.119" end="00:10:46.989" style="s2">comes from Plato there&#39;s an influence</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.589" end="00:10:51.759" style="s2">from Plato so if you remember Plato has</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.989" end="00:10:55.949" style="s2">this idea about the everyday world right</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.759" end="00:10:59.769" style="s2">is there the everyday world is a world</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.949" end="00:11:02.829" style="s2">like the shadows and the echoes these</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.769" end="00:11:06.100" style="s2">things are not fully real this table</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.829" end="00:11:09.329" style="s2">this wall is pen they&#39;re in a profound</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.100" end="00:11:11.079" style="s2">sense images right they participate in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.329" end="00:11:13.209" style="s2">the forms</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.079" end="00:11:18.129" style="s2">remember those powder</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.209" end="00:11:22.629" style="s2">of intelligibility and realness so Plato</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.129" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">had a problem which is the forums are</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.629" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">basically eternal so if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:27.129" style="s2">something like you know equals</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:31.480" style="s2">mc-squared</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.129" end="00:11:34.449" style="s2">right that&#39;s not an event it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.480" end="00:11:36.759" style="s2">timeless and spaceless and then how does</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.449" end="00:11:41.589" style="s2">this it turn how do these eternal forms</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.759" end="00:11:43.089" style="s2">how do they express themselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.589" end="00:11:48.309" style="s2">temporal things the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.089" end="00:11:51.429" style="s2">changing here so basically how do time</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.309" end="00:11:54.879" style="s2">and eternity intersect and so Plato</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.429" end="00:11:56.410" style="s2">proposed a mythological answer he closed</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.879" end="00:12:00.699" style="s2">that there was a figure he called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.410" end="00:12:03.910" style="s2">figure the craftsman the demiurges the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.699" end="00:12:07.059" style="s2">Demiurge and what the Demiurge is is he</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.910" end="00:12:09.339" style="s2">can sort of become aware of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.059" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">because he&#39;s rational agent and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.339" end="00:12:18.040" style="s2">what he does is he shapes things in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:20.559" style="s2">space and time in order to make the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.040" end="00:12:23.709" style="s2">world of the coming have some reality to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.559" end="00:12:26.439" style="s2">it and so it has some important</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.709" end="00:12:29.139" style="s2">similarities to the eternal world and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.439" end="00:12:31.660" style="s2">that means that by pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.139" end="00:12:34.449" style="s2">temporal events we can become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.660" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">these eternal principles sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.449" end="00:12:41.019" style="s2">science does right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2">now whether all of that is true I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.019" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">in an important sense it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.850" end="00:12:48.009" style="s2">there&#39;s a mythological point here Plato</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.980" end="00:12:50.259" style="s2">is trying to understand mythologically</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.009" end="00:12:54.299" style="s2">the relationship he&#39;s trying to give us</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.259" end="00:12:56.769" style="s2">a way in imagery and story of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.299" end="00:13:04.470" style="s2">understanding the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.769" end="00:13:09.819" style="s2">eternity and time now the Gnostics were</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.470" end="00:13:11.589" style="s2">influenced by this but they took this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.819" end="00:13:14.549" style="s2">notion and they did something very</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.589" end="00:13:18.519" style="s2">interesting to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.549" end="00:13:21.100" style="s2">because they said the temporal world the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.519" end="00:13:24.129" style="s2">everyday world were in is a world of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.100" end="00:13:26.259" style="s2">very significant suffering so remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.129" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">they&#39;re there after the Hellenistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.259" end="00:13:30.009" style="s2">garments</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:31.389" style="s2">there during a period both where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.009" end="00:13:33.339" style="s2">Ellen istic dhamma site is still in</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.389" end="00:13:35.829" style="s2">existence and the roman empire has</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.339" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">caused massive pain and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.829" end="00:13:41.649" style="s2">throughout the world so they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:43.989" style="s2">at the everyday world and they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.649" end="00:13:46.540" style="s2">all this suffering they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.989" end="00:13:48.819" style="s2">deeply trapped within it</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.540" end="00:13:52.540" style="s2">existentially trapped and the way we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.819" end="00:13:54.519" style="s2">been talking about so for them that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.540" end="00:14:00.579" style="s2">very clear evidence that whoever had</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.519" end="00:14:02.519" style="s2">created this world was either stupid or</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.579" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">evil or both</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.519" end="00:14:08.619" style="s2">they were looking around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:12.009" style="s2">saying look at how much we suffer look</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.619" end="00:14:15.449" style="s2">at how much pain we&#39;re in look at how</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.009" end="00:14:18.699" style="s2">much we&#39;re trapped and therefore what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.449" end="00:14:22.239" style="s2">what whatever is creating the structures</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.699" end="00:14:26.980" style="s2">that we&#39;re living in is both stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.239" end="00:14:31.990" style="s2">evil so they in Plato the Demiurge is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.980" end="00:14:34.629" style="s2">basically a beneficent being but in here</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.990" end="00:14:41.639" style="s2">the Demiurge very often becomes</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.629" end="00:14:44.410" style="s2">something like an evil overlord now</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.639" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here well what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.410" end="00:14:52.149" style="s2">trying to do is articulate again the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.790" end="00:14:54.910" style="s2">sense of being trapped and that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.149" end="00:14:57.189" style="s2">socio-economic socio cultural political</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.910" end="00:15:00.189" style="s2">economic structures that they find</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.189" end="00:15:04.209" style="s2">themselves in are actually thwarting</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.189" end="00:15:08.679" style="s2">them and now when I say it that way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.209" end="00:15:10.449" style="s2">like oh maybe that&#39;s a mythological way</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.679" end="00:15:12.339" style="s2">of talking about something that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.449" end="00:15:14.860" style="s2">might be experiencing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.339" end="00:15:17.139" style="s2">experiencing existential entrapment and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.860" end="00:15:19.720" style="s2">then when you look out at the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.139" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">of your culture the patterns right are</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.720" end="00:15:24.790" style="s2">the market patterns the political</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:27.160" style="s2">patterns you don&#39;t feel like they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.790" end="00:15:30.519" style="s2">shaping a world that is going to help</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.160" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">alleviate your trap meant instead you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.519" end="00:15:37.119" style="s2">feel that they are stupid and evil and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.959" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">know from a lot of the research we did</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.119" end="00:15:42.759" style="s2">for the book on zombies with the</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.470" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">to existing mythologies and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.709" end="00:17:14.409" style="s2">they did something that is radical they</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:18.250" style="s2">identified all the existing gods whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.409" end="00:17:21.159" style="s2">it&#39;s the god of the the Jews or the god</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.250" end="00:17:25.209" style="s2">of the Romans instead of seeing these</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.159" end="00:17:30.250" style="s2">gods as divine beings they saw these</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.209" end="00:17:37.750" style="s2">gods as basically the guards of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.250" end="00:17:39.580" style="s2">prison so they see everything else that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.750" end="00:17:44.830" style="s2">people had thought of as previously</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.580" end="00:17:46.809" style="s2">sacred all the gods as actually things</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.830" end="00:17:49.780" style="s2">imprisoning us even Paul was talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.809" end="00:17:52.270" style="s2">about this in the Bible where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.780" end="00:17:55.470" style="s2">about powers and principalities that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.270" end="00:17:55.470" style="s2">keep us imprisoned</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.690" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">now I want you to stop and pause because</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:08.270" style="s2">this is a radical idea this is an idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.750" end="00:18:12.410" style="s2">that there has been something common to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.270" end="00:18:17.300" style="s2">all of these gods that must now be</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.410" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">challenged so up until now right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.300" end="00:18:25.820" style="s2">relationship between us and them was one</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:28.010" style="s2">of servitude often bordering on notions</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.820" end="00:18:30.910" style="s2">of slavery we were the slaves or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.010" end="00:18:30.910" style="s2">servants of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.020" end="00:18:40.270" style="s2">the Gnostics want to invert that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.370" end="00:18:44.360" style="s2">want to tell you that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.270" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">worshiping these gods instead of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.360" end="00:18:50.650" style="s2">idolizing these gods instead of giving</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">in to these powers and principalities</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.650" end="00:18:56.350" style="s2">these patterns that are pervasive and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:58.940" style="s2">profound in the way they entrap us</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.350" end="00:19:01.250" style="s2">instead of thinking how we should serve</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.940" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">and fit into them think of this again</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.250" end="00:19:05.690" style="s2">remember the actual revolution don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:07.820" style="s2">to fit in to the everyday world you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.690" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">to transcend it instead of serving and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:20.929" style="s2">fitting in we have to transcend them all</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">they are not divine they are our prison</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.929" end="00:19:29.179" style="s2">guards they may be powerful but instead</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:33.860" style="s2">what we need to realize is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.179" end="00:19:36.950" style="s2">something in us they thought of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.860" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">divine spark that will actually carry us</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.950" end="00:19:44.150" style="s2">above to the God beyond all gods which</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:45.290" style="s2">sounds like a contradiction because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.150" end="00:19:50.390" style="s2">course that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.290" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">at the idea here can be expressed using</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.390" end="00:19:57.590" style="s2">some of the Christian mythology that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">they were quite willing to well it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.590" end="00:20:00.860" style="s2">depends who you&#39;re talking to if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:04.130" style="s2">Orthodox Christian you see the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.860" end="00:20:07.399" style="s2">as perverting your mythology if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.130" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">not excused see yourself as disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.399" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">by transformation what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:17.960" style="s2">available in the mythology so from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:23.779" style="s2">Gnostics this God is the God of the Old</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.960" end="00:20:30.279" style="s2">Testament evil jealous vindictive right</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.779" end="00:20:35.210" style="s2">who threatens and and bullies people his</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.049" end="00:20:47.149" style="s2">says the god of the old tell em of</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.330" end="00:21:01.099" style="s2">and all this horrific stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.499" end="00:21:04.339" style="s2">that God is compared to the god of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.099" end="00:21:08.989" style="s2">New Testament the God of Agape the God</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.339" end="00:21:13.700" style="s2">of light and love and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.989" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">God was the God beyond all gods does not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.700" end="00:21:21.320" style="s2">want our worship wants us to reunite</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:24.830" style="s2">with him he wants us or she wants us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.320" end="00:21:26.989" style="s2">fully participate and I have to say he</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.830" end="00:21:28.669" style="s2">and she specifically for the Gnostics is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.989" end="00:21:30.889" style="s2">one of the things they also challenged</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.669" end="00:21:32.479" style="s2">was the difference between the genders</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.889" end="00:21:35.029" style="s2">in the ancient world they&#39;re famous for</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.479" end="00:21:44.330" style="s2">that of thinking women are as equally</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.029" end="00:21:47.719" style="s2">capable of a spiritual life as men so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.330" end="00:21:52.489" style="s2">are radically not at home because this</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.719" end="00:21:54.919" style="s2">this our capacity for a gapek love means</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.489" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">we have a gnostic potential we have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.919" end="00:22:02.989" style="s2">power the potential to remember to know</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:06.289" style="s2">that we belong here we can sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.989" end="00:22:10.549" style="s2">don&#39;t belong here we can sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.289" end="00:22:12.879" style="s2">belong somewhere else we know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.549" end="00:22:18.289" style="s2">something fundamentally wrong here and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.879" end="00:22:21.230" style="s2">then the idea is this this God beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.289" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">all gods this absolute fullness of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.230" end="00:22:29.480" style="s2">sends individuals down into the world of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:32.690" style="s2">suffering to bring us the gnosis to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:36.620" style="s2">bring us this kind of transformative</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.690" end="00:22:38.810" style="s2">knowledge that will set us free and what</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.620" end="00:22:42.470" style="s2">the Gnostic Christians did is they said</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.810" end="00:22:46.150" style="s2">Jesus was this individual so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.470" end="00:22:50.170" style="s2">Gnostics don&#39;t put a huge emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.150" end="00:22:53.420" style="s2">the person of Jesus and his crucifixion</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.170" end="00:22:56.210" style="s2">instead that teachings of Jesus are much</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.420" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">more important to them because what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.210" end="00:23:02.950" style="s2">what is going to happen here is Jesus is</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:06.920" style="s2">going to bring us the way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.950" end="00:23:12.830" style="s2">gnosis of agape so that we can free</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.920" end="00:23:19.480" style="s2">ourselves from this so then the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.830" end="00:23:24.020" style="s2">therefore don&#39;t don&#39;t see the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.480" end="00:23:28.210" style="s2">Christianity as doctrine or Dogma the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.020" end="00:23:32.870" style="s2">purpose of it is to give us a mythology</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.210" end="00:23:35.560" style="s2">that will free us from our existential</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.870" end="00:23:38.900" style="s2">suffering and allow us to experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.560" end="00:23:41.720" style="s2">this transcendence of the gods now this</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.900" end="00:23:43.280" style="s2">this inversion right this radical</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.720" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">inversion it&#39;s like this what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.280" end="00:23:47.780" style="s2">it&#39;s the calm and age it&#39;s the axial</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:50.060" style="s2">revolution that it&#39;s finally applied to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.780" end="00:23:55.070" style="s2">even to the whole mythological framework</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.060" end="00:23:58.760" style="s2">of the ancient world and what it means</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.070" end="00:23:59.930" style="s2">is the the Gnostics have a very and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.760" end="00:24:01.730" style="s2">is one of the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.930" end="00:24:03.980" style="s2">critics often leveled against them the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.730" end="00:24:06.890" style="s2">Gnostics keep churning out new Gospels</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.980" end="00:24:09.250" style="s2">and new stories and new myth because for</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.890" end="00:24:13.430" style="s2">them it&#39;s not about having a final</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.250" end="00:24:17.170" style="s2">Orthodox story a final Orthodox set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.430" end="00:24:21.670" style="s2">principles it&#39;s about having engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.170" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">participated in the process of creating</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:36.070" style="s2">agog a that&#39;s what matters that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.080" end="00:24:36.070" style="s2">actually matters</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.980" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">now this idea that spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.380" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">ultimately about transcending the gods</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:56.340" style="s2">rather than serving the gods is very</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:59.820" style="s2">it&#39;s very both pertinent to us today and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.340" end="00:25:03.750" style="s2">very radical for its time because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.820" end="00:25:06.020" style="s2">have basically the challenging of a not</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.750" end="00:25:08.220" style="s2">even a belief it was just an</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.020" end="00:25:10.050" style="s2">unquestioned presupposition that our</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.050" end="00:25:15.540" style="s2">servitude and slavery getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.420" end="00:25:20.340" style="s2">transformed into no no descent the core</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.540" end="00:25:24.830" style="s2">of spirituality is not worship the core</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.340" end="00:25:29.270" style="s2">of spirituality is self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.830" end="00:25:31.559" style="s2">healing and freeing people from</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.010" end="00:25:51.330" style="s2">first of all it still got all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.140" end="00:25:54.360" style="s2">platonic elements here are the people</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.420" end="00:26:02.790" style="s2">frees them so that they can return to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.790" end="00:26:04.590" style="s2">and see the light right but of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.790" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">for Plato you come back down into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.590" end="00:26:09.450" style="s2">cave the cave for the Gnostics you try</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:15.990" style="s2">to spread the message to as many people</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.450" end="00:26:18.090" style="s2">as you can so it has the Platonism it of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.990" end="00:26:21.020" style="s2">course has a way of connecting that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.090" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">platonism to christianity by</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.020" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">reinterpreting jesus as the embodiment</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.410" end="00:27:53.390" style="s2">entrapped in a world of illusion there</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.320" end="00:27:55.460" style="s2">are evil overlords who are trying to</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.290" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">you can see a movie starring Jim Carrey</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.050" end="00:28:52.850" style="s2">because it keeps pointing us to patterns</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:56.540" style="s2">that are pervasive and profound and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.850" end="00:29:00.230" style="s2">powerful and we can&#39;t quite articulate</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.230" end="00:29:05.780" style="s2">the myth at least gives us a moment of</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.780" end="00:29:23.030" style="s2">recognition of our suffering so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.510" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">Gnostics are offering a radical form of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.030" end="00:29:31.730" style="s2">the actual revolution now it carries</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:33.320" style="s2">with it a dark side they keep showing</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.730" end="00:29:34.430" style="s2">you with all of this stuff that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.320" end="00:29:37.480" style="s2">light side and the dark side of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.430" end="00:29:40.400" style="s2">Christianity right and you probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.480" end="00:29:42.260" style="s2">could see how there&#39;s a Gnostic element</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.400" end="00:29:44.060" style="s2">also with in Star Wars you&#39;ve trapped</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.260" end="00:29:46.490" style="s2">within the Empire with the evil overlord</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.060" end="00:29:48.380" style="s2">the Emperor and you have to get free and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.490" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">you need to have the knowledge of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.380" end="00:29:52.820" style="s2">force that will set you free and blah</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:55.630" style="s2">blah blah blah like we love this and we</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.630" end="00:30:00.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the dark side of the Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.950" end="00:30:04.820" style="s2">vision the doc&#39;s the dark side of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.800" end="00:30:07.040" style="s2">Gnostic vision is it can it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.820" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">to and many of them many of the original</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.040" end="00:30:14.750" style="s2">Gnostic writers that I&#39;ve read it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:19.550" style="s2">not the case but it can do this this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.750" end="00:30:24.170" style="s2">ultimately a conspiracy theory this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.550" end="00:30:25.490" style="s2">grand conspiracy theory that behind look</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.170" end="00:30:28.340" style="s2">one of the reasons why this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.490" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">comforting is behind all the apparent</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.340" end="00:30:37.610" style="s2">chaos and suffering there actually is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:40.990" style="s2">some evil overlord I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.610" end="00:30:45.260" style="s2">things that would make evil so much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.990" end="00:30:49.040" style="s2">tractable for us as if it was ensconced</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.260" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">within an individual but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.040" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">ultimate conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.460" end="00:31:02.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole system that is keeping</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.790" end="00:31:06.020" style="s2">you from realizing the truth and who you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.520" end="00:31:11.250" style="s2">truly are the true man that you are and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.020" end="00:31:13.080" style="s2">how you belong elsewhere and living</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.250" end="00:31:17.550" style="s2">another way and now you say oh well</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.080" end="00:31:21.660" style="s2">conspiracy well stop and think look what</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.550" end="00:31:23.420" style="s2">are the Gnostics saying this evil</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.660" end="00:31:26.610" style="s2">overlord</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.420" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">some of them say not all of them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.610" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">the same as the god of the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.040" end="00:31:39.930" style="s2">who are the people that worship the God</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.110" end="00:31:41.940" style="s2">of the Old Testament the Jews here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.930" end="00:31:46.560" style="s2">idea that&#39;s now being sewn into Western</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:51.030" style="s2">culture the Jews are part of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.560" end="00:31:54.840" style="s2">conspiracy to keep us from realizing our</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.030" end="00:31:57.540" style="s2">true heritage that is going to turn out</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.840" end="00:32:04.230" style="s2">to be an extraordinarily dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.540" end="00:32:06.030" style="s2">bloodthirsty idea Nazism is a twisted</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.230" end="00:32:09.540" style="s2">and other people have pointed this out</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.030" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">Nazi Nazism is not primarily a political</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.540" end="00:32:17.730" style="s2">or even a socio-economic movement Nazism</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:20.760" style="s2">is a twisted Gnostic response of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.730" end="00:32:27.630" style="s2">meaning crisis that was being magnified</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.760" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">in the Weimar Republic of Germany so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.630" end="00:32:36.510" style="s2">there is a dark side to Gnosticism so we</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:41.580" style="s2">should have an ambivalent attitude</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.510" end="00:32:46.560" style="s2">towards it in order to understand it we</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.580" end="00:32:49.580" style="s2">must think of how we can extricate Nasus</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.560" end="00:32:52.830" style="s2">from Gnosticism how can we salvage</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.580" end="00:32:57.780" style="s2">gnosis from narcissism just like how can</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:33:02.600" style="s2">we salvage agape from Christianity how</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.780" end="00:33:05.990" style="s2">can we salvage wisdom from the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.600" end="00:33:05.990" style="s2">neurological order</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.550" end="00:33:17.520" style="s2">so on one side right you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.750" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">dangers why did this happen it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.520" end="00:33:22.700" style="s2">complicated story but part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:26.100" style="s2">problem part of the reason is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.700" end="00:33:27.990" style="s2">emerging fourth Oh doc Church it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.100" end="00:33:29.880" style="s2">even an Orthodox Church at that time it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.990" end="00:33:32.220" style="s2">called itself the Apostolic Church the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.880" end="00:33:34.590" style="s2">church that thought Jesus was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.220" end="00:33:38.130" style="s2">unique right and the point was to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.590" end="00:33:41.130" style="s2">worship Him and that faith is what was</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.130" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">crucial faith in the sense of believing</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.130" end="00:33:51.059" style="s2">in him as a sacrifice persecuted and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:52.980" style="s2">mean that literally persecuted the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.059" end="00:33:57.330" style="s2">Gnostic form of Christianity and drove</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.980" end="00:34:00.630" style="s2">it underground and as underground it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.330" end="00:34:04.380" style="s2">became a meshed with any type of group</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.630" end="00:34:08.100" style="s2">that was trying to challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.380" end="00:34:10.830" style="s2">established order and that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.100" end="00:34:12.540" style="s2">tends to surface again and Nazism will</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.830" end="00:34:16.530" style="s2">see there are more things that feed into</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.540" end="00:34:19.560" style="s2">Nazism but that&#39;s all we need for right</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.530" end="00:34:21.600" style="s2">now Gnosticism of course is also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.560" end="00:34:26.520" style="s2">influential in some very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.600" end="00:34:28.860" style="s2">people so here are three people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.520" end="00:34:30.360" style="s2">going to start talking about more and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.860" end="00:34:34.970" style="s2">more you&#39;ve already heard me talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.360" end="00:34:39.389" style="s2">Tillich Tillich is one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.970" end="00:34:41.550" style="s2">theologians Tillich talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.389" end="00:34:42.990" style="s2">meaning crisis in a classic book that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.550" end="00:34:46.830" style="s2">highly recommend to you called the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.990" end="00:34:48.929" style="s2">courage to be and he talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.830" end="00:34:51.450" style="s2">the response to that is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.929" end="00:34:53.669" style="s2">discovering and it&#39;s clear because of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.450" end="00:34:55.379" style="s2">how he talks about symbols and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.669" end="00:34:58.340" style="s2">about transformation although he does</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.379" end="00:35:00.900" style="s2">not use the term but he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.340" end="00:35:02.940" style="s2">gnosis he&#39;s talking about that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.900" end="00:35:05.100" style="s2">response to the meaning crisis is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:09.080" style="s2">gnosis of the God beyond the god of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.100" end="00:35:12.510" style="s2">theism that what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.080" end="00:35:14.700" style="s2">discover the God who of course is not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.510" end="00:35:16.890" style="s2">God because what&#39;s the God beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.700" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">God of theism as the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.890" end="00:35:22.910" style="s2">destroys</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.420" end="00:40:07.050" style="s2">trying to give you an argument for it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.920" end="00:40:12.360" style="s2">how we should have an ambivalent</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.360" end="00:40:19.980" style="s2">back in the historical picture because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.350" end="00:40:22.740" style="s2">told you about the the three that are</p>

<p begin="00:40:24.180" end="00:40:30.510" style="s2">Christianity we&#39;ve seen this by taking a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.190" end="00:40:34.590" style="s2">look at right Jesus and John and Paul</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.510" end="00:40:36.420" style="s2">and we&#39;ve seen how it&#39;s interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.590" end="00:40:40.830" style="s2">Gnosticism we have already seen how</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.420" end="00:40:43.710" style="s2">Gnosticism is influenced and influencing</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.830" end="00:40:49.380" style="s2">platonism and in particular I want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.710" end="00:40:52.500" style="s2">look at Neoplatonism because it is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.380" end="00:40:55.620" style="s2">deeply enmeshed with Christianity this</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.500" end="00:40:59.250" style="s2">triangle is going to be necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.620" end="00:41:01.590" style="s2">understanding the final elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.250" end="00:41:03.420" style="s2">orders of meaning the grammar of you as</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.590" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve put it before of meaning we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:15.210" style="s2">what is Neoplatonism by the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:17.540" style="s2">Neoplatonism is also why the main</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.210" end="00:41:22.320" style="s2">character and the matrix is called neo</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.540" end="00:41:25.290" style="s2">for neoplatonism and he&#39;s often referred</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.320" end="00:41:28.380" style="s2">to as the one because the one is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.290" end="00:41:32.460" style="s2">central thing within neoplatonism again</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.380" end="00:41:35.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why all of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.460" end="00:41:43.470" style="s2">mythological patterns keep being so</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.970" end="00:41:44.910" style="s2">attractive to us so platanus let me give</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.470" end="00:41:47.550" style="s2">you an analogy I think this is a helpful</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.910" end="00:41:49.650" style="s2">analogy scientists right now are trying</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.020" end="00:42:12.300" style="s2">collapses by analogy platanus is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.510" end="00:42:17.010" style="s2">grand unified field theory of ancient</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.300" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">spirituality cuz what does he do well he</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.010" end="00:42:28.010" style="s2">takes plato spirituality he takes the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:33.870" style="s2">whole idea of an agog a right from Plato</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.010" end="00:42:36.390" style="s2">he takes Aristotle&#39;s theory the whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.870" end="00:42:39.780" style="s2">Aristotle worldview the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.390" end="00:42:42.330" style="s2">knowing right the theory of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.330" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">about that and he takes from the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.600" end="00:43:04.570" style="s2">that whole therapeutic project right</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">overcoming modal confusion and what he</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.570" end="00:43:14.940" style="s2">does is he integrates them together he</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.940" end="00:43:25.240" style="s2">how does he do that well he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.510" end="00:43:28.690" style="s2">first of all he says well let&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.240" end="00:43:30.610" style="s2">thing well you can start anywhere you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.690" end="00:43:32.950" style="s2">can start in any one of these places in</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.610" end="00:43:36.490" style="s2">Platanos as writing and then get to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.950" end="00:43:38.590" style="s2">other two it&#39;s it is such a powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.490" end="00:43:40.390" style="s2">integrated system and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.590" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">reading Platonists it&#39;s not like when</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:47.770" style="s2">argument you&#39;re also undergoing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:50.500" style="s2">spiritual exercise that is trying to</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.500" end="00:43:57.730" style="s2">your cognition so what&#39;s the main theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.360" end="00:43:59.770" style="s2">here let&#39;s start here so if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.730" end="00:44:03.190" style="s2">you have Aristotle&#39;s conformity theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.770" end="00:44:06.420" style="s2">we know something right remember this by</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.190" end="00:44:10.120" style="s2">conforming to it by sharing the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.420" end="00:44:16.600" style="s2">structural functional organization with</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.120" end="00:44:20.410" style="s2">it right and then Platina says a wait a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.600" end="00:44:23.230" style="s2">sec Aristotle also has sort of levels of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.410" end="00:44:26.110" style="s2">being and we talked about this we talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.230" end="00:44:28.540" style="s2">about at the lowest level right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.110" end="00:44:33.160" style="s2">pure potentiality and at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.540" end="00:44:34.570" style="s2">level there&#39;s pure actuality and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.160" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">don&#39;t need to get into the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.570" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">but here&#39;s the idea there are levels of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:48.340" style="s2">reality levels of realness as we know</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:50.260" style="s2">and this doesn&#39;t mean intellectual as we</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.340" end="00:44:52.660" style="s2">like this is participatory this is very</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.260" end="00:44:54.850" style="s2">much like gnosis and he&#39;s in discussion</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.450" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">he all of his stuff is so good right</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.049" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">as we conform and make this level of</p>

<p begin="00:45:56.920" end="00:46:10.710" style="s2">higher level of reality what this does</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.279" end="00:46:13.739" style="s2">for us is it helps us deeply remember</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.710" end="00:46:15.849" style="s2">the being mode who we really are</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.739" end="00:46:21.430" style="s2">let me try and do put this all together</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.849" end="00:46:25.989" style="s2">you with an example what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.430" end="00:46:29.349" style="s2">makes something real think about this</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.989" end="00:46:33.579" style="s2">think about Socrates here right Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.349" end="00:46:35.170" style="s2">like what do you mean by real we we care</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.579" end="00:46:37.210" style="s2">about whether or not things are real</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.170" end="00:46:39.160" style="s2">with like it really matters to us look</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.210" end="00:46:42.670" style="s2">at the word really it really matters to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.160" end="00:46:47.259" style="s2">us and yet what is it that makes</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.670" end="00:46:53.589" style="s2">something real how much time have you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.259" end="00:46:56.739" style="s2">put into that because if you are driven</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.589" end="00:46:59.369" style="s2">by a pursuit of realness and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.739" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">understand what it is if you if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.369" end="00:47:03.849" style="s2">something you&#39;re pursuing and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.690" end="00:47:12.430" style="s2">understand remember what that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.849" end="00:47:15.089" style="s2">the gap of okay so what makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.430" end="00:47:15.089" style="s2">something real</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.369" end="00:47:23.630" style="s2">well and and notice for Latinas and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.499" end="00:47:27.619" style="s2">again Eric pearl make especially in his</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.630" end="00:47:28.999" style="s2">book thinking being just a fantastically</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.619" end="00:47:33.259" style="s2">brilliant book can&#39;t recommend it enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.999" end="00:47:36.410" style="s2">right but it&#39;s not what makes something</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.259" end="00:47:38.630" style="s2">real is how do we also sense it as real</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.410" end="00:47:41.420" style="s2">so it&#39;s both what structurally</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.630" end="00:47:43.099" style="s2">functionally organizes it to be real two</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.420" end="00:47:45.470" style="s2">sides of the worldview and what makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.099" end="00:47:47.390" style="s2">how do we sense it how does it make us</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.470" end="00:47:50.839" style="s2">be able to sense it as real and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.390" end="00:47:56.809" style="s2">the answer and it and it&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.839" end="00:47:59.170" style="s2">it&#39;s basic but another sense it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.809" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s profound what makes something real</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.170" end="00:48:07.849" style="s2">is how one it is how integrated it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">how much it is structurally functionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.849" end="00:48:14.089" style="s2">organized so we treat the object as more</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:17.799" style="s2">real than the shadows because it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.089" end="00:48:17.799" style="s2">structurally functionally organized</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.339" end="00:48:23.210" style="s2">that&#39;s talking about the object when is</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.809" end="00:48:25.039" style="s2">what is it to understand something well</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.210" end="00:48:27.380" style="s2">here&#39;s a bunch of separate things and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.039" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">when I understand them I find how</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.380" end="00:48:30.380" style="s2">they&#39;re all one how they can all be</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">integrated together</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.380" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">when I understand something I understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.170" style="s2">how all of its parts are integrated</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:37.700" style="s2">together and then what we do is okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.170" end="00:48:39.739" style="s2">these things have been integrated here</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.700" end="00:48:43.160" style="s2">and then oh and I can integrate these</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.739" end="00:48:46.099" style="s2">here and I can and this is more real</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.160" end="00:48:47.809" style="s2">what&#39;s one behind all of these variants</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.099" end="00:48:52.099" style="s2">thing and then I can course find what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.809" end="00:48:56.200" style="s2">underneath all of this and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.099" end="00:48:56.200" style="s2">underneath this and once underneath this</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:01.819" style="s2">things become more real to us as we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:05.089" style="s2">integrate them together and they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.819" end="00:49:10.309" style="s2">real as things as they are integrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.089" end="00:49:12.920" style="s2">together so as we try and find the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.309" end="00:49:17.269" style="s2">deeper underlying principles that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.920" end="00:49:21.079" style="s2">integrate things together we become more</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.269" end="00:49:21.609" style="s2">integrative together and we become more</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.609" end="00:49:28.770" style="s2">we are realized it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.940" end="00:49:31.380" style="s2">the object we&#39;re getting to what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.770" end="00:49:36.470" style="s2">real and we as we become more integrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.380" end="00:49:40.140" style="s2">more actualized are becoming more real</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.470" end="00:49:43.740" style="s2">I&#39;m becoming more integrated and you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.140" end="00:49:45.330" style="s2">see this at Plato&#39;s in agog a write the</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.330" end="00:49:50.820" style="s2">reduced I&#39;m becoming more real as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.880" end="00:49:54.600" style="s2">becoming more integrated and that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.820" end="00:49:58.140" style="s2">allowing me to make viable and real</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.600" end="00:50:00.690" style="s2">these more integrated deeper levels of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.140" end="00:50:06.030" style="s2">reality and then the whole thing spins</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.030" end="00:50:12.450" style="s2">from where things are only potential</p>
