<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">my trusted sources right a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.130" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">way you interpret information and are</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">able to kind of see the tea leaves</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.480" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">before everybody else does and it just</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:32.009" style="s2">makes sense of it more appropriately</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.009" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">a friend and I wanted to touch base with</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">you but I also figured you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">could record this and it would be useful</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:41.670" style="s2">because I could share it with some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">the people in my community as well so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.670" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">what we&#39;re living in interesting times</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">say a word you know recently what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">called it a liminal event yeah why do</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">you think that this is you know as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:08.750" style="s2">guess important as it is today</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:08.750" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a hard question</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.939" end="00:01:28.729" style="s2">hmm okay so let&#39;s start with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.939" end="00:01:32.209" style="s2">almost in the beginning there&#39;s a if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.729" end="00:01:32.899" style="s2">use the metaphor of the addict the you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.209" end="00:01:36.950" style="s2">know the addict</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.899" end="00:01:41.060" style="s2">has a to be an ad means in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.950" end="00:01:42.890" style="s2">fundamentally to choose to to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.060" end="00:01:44.899" style="s2">yourself and can choose to delude</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.890" end="00:01:49.390" style="s2">yourself to choose instead of actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.899" end="00:01:52.069" style="s2">perceiving reality to to keep have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.390" end="00:01:52.849" style="s2">preferred delusion an explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.069" end="00:01:54.380" style="s2">what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.849" end="00:01:56.149" style="s2">that allows them to continue to be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.380" end="00:02:00.379" style="s2">addict right that&#39;s the key the key to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.149" end="00:02:02.450" style="s2">the whole thing and you know within the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.379" end="00:02:04.579" style="s2">addict arc there&#39;s a downward spiral I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.450" end="00:02:06.049" style="s2">mean if you&#39;re deluded you&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.579" end="00:02:07.489" style="s2">good choices in the context of reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.049" end="00:02:08.869" style="s2">because reality is trying to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.489" end="00:02:11.450" style="s2">what&#39;s what to do and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.869" end="00:02:12.739" style="s2">listening right yeah so you things get</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.450" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">worse so the delusion has to become more</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.739" end="00:02:16.100" style="s2">intense and things get worse than</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.030" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">delusion has become more intense until</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.100" end="00:02:21.069" style="s2">you hit rock bottom alright some event</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:23.930" style="s2">occurs where reality hits you so hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.069" end="00:02:25.489" style="s2">that your delusion pops loose for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.930" end="00:02:27.560" style="s2">moment you have a moment of clarity a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.489" end="00:02:30.109" style="s2">liminal event are you entering through</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.560" end="00:02:32.989" style="s2">space where the constructs that you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.109" end="00:02:34.430" style="s2">imposed on yourself that have separated</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.989" end="00:02:36.590" style="s2">you from effective choice making</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.430" end="00:02:39.230" style="s2">suddenly drop and you&#39;re able to look</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.590" end="00:02:41.299" style="s2">around and begin the process of climbing</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.230" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">back into sobriety now you may not make</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.299" end="00:02:44.870" style="s2">it but at least you&#39;re the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.370" style="s2">to do that I think this parable is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.870" end="00:02:48.919" style="s2">good parable for where we are as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:51.169" style="s2">civilization right we are in a we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.919" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">deeply deeply addicted and we have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.169" end="00:02:56.209" style="s2">deeply deeply separated from reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">along a lot of fronts right pick any</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.209" end="00:03:00.530" style="s2">part of our civilization the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">are married</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.530" end="00:03:05.299" style="s2">our dyadic relationships our families</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.010" style="s2">the way that we educate and raise our</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.299" end="00:03:10.220" style="s2">children the way that we produce and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.010" end="00:03:12.109" style="s2">distribute and eat food even the basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.220" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">stuff the way that we spend our time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.109" end="00:03:16.040" style="s2">attention obviously the way that we we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.690" end="00:03:18.440" style="s2">choose our leaders and whether we make</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.040" end="00:03:19.669" style="s2">choices as a community the way they ruin</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.440" end="00:03:21.769" style="s2">our financial system these things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.669" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">all ultimately been running on</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.769" end="00:03:25.730" style="s2">increasingly intense delusion for a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:29.690" style="s2">time in our hyper fragile</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.730" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">and this is an opportunity really this</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.690" end="00:03:33.170" style="s2">event it&#39;s hitting us is something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">is actually generating a liminal event</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.170" end="00:03:36.830" style="s2">reality is hitting us we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.569" style="s2">shuttling so think about how many people</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.830" end="00:03:41.780" style="s2">right now in many cases for the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.569" end="00:03:44.360" style="s2">time actually have to make meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.780" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2">choices which is to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.360" end="00:03:47.690" style="s2">whatever was I didn&#39;t know but my time</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.190" end="00:03:50.860" style="s2">spans gotten very odd because things</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.690" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">were happening so fast but two weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.860" end="00:03:55.819" style="s2">probably for a lot of people the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:58.519" style="s2">question of hey should I go buy a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.819" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">like extra food and water came into</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.519" end="00:04:03.970" style="s2">their mind right and their sense making</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:06.109" style="s2">framework actually had to make a choice</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.970" end="00:04:08.629" style="s2">do I just kind of keep going and doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.109" end="00:04:10.310" style="s2">whatever I do or do I actually get out</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.629" end="00:04:11.690" style="s2">of my normal habit maybe it&#39;s little</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.310" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">uncomfortable and go do this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.690" end="00:04:17.810" style="s2">that possibly even seems weird and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:19.459" style="s2">wasteful yeah two weeks later you get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.810" end="00:04:20.600" style="s2">you get to find out that the exam comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.459" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">back you get to see what kind of grade</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.600" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">your sense making framework had and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.389" style="s2">you&#39;re looking around going oh this</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:27.770" style="s2">the store shelves are now bare I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.389" end="00:04:29.900" style="s2">happened to have run out of of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.770" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">groceries because you know you consume</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:33.740" style="s2">which you&#39;ve got huh maybe that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">the best choice like even just that like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.740" end="00:04:36.349" style="s2">people are now realizing that they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:39.110" style="s2">to actually start making meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.349" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">choices I noticed my my teenage</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.110" end="00:04:45.050" style="s2">daughters and by the way not just people</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">but also institutions so San Diego I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.050" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">got two kids in high school and on a day</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">let&#39;s call it eight days ago an email</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.760" style="s2">goes out to parents everybody when</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:04:57.979" style="s2">everybody&#39;s very concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.760" end="00:05:00.289" style="s2">coronavirus children just want to let</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.979" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">you know that under state law if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.289" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">pull your kid out of school they will</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">have an unexcused and excused absence</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:08.630" style="s2">and so the bureaucracy the institution</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:12.590" style="s2">with literally punishing parents for</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.630" end="00:05:15.010" style="s2">making that choice okay fast-forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.590" end="00:05:19.010" style="s2">five days and the school district says</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.010" end="00:05:20.389" style="s2">schools cancelled until April 10th or</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.010" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">something like that and here&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.389" end="00:05:23.449" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">and by the way Spring Break is now</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.449" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">canceled and pulled into that period so</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">we&#39;re basically getting rid of Spring</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:29.630" style="s2">Break and we&#39;re kind of gluing it into</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:31.460" style="s2">this event I think they&#39;re like the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:32.840" style="s2">day they send that in to say apologize</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.460" end="00:05:36.860" style="s2">apologize no Spring Break is gonna stay</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.840" end="00:05:39.449" style="s2">and is still out so all right so schools</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.860" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">cancelled but now what do the parents do</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.449" end="00:05:44.069" style="s2">yeah got kids that are no longer gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:45.539" style="s2">be a school what&#39;s the rule was to rule</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.069" end="00:05:47.340" style="s2">in the house yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.539" end="00:05:48.750" style="s2">from from my daughter&#39;s the rule was in</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.340" end="00:05:51.210" style="s2">fact what they&#39;re calling house arrests</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.750" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">which is to say sorry quarantine theirs</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.210" end="00:05:53.879" style="s2">they&#39;ve got their grandparents to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.500" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">with them so they need to be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.879" end="00:05:57.599" style="s2">careful than most but then some actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2">the numbers know him to be perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.599" end="00:06:04.289" style="s2">frank but any event but only a fracture</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.500" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">their friends were equally under house</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.289" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">arrest</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:10.259" style="s2">yeah day two a much larger fraction</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.550" end="00:06:21.960" style="s2">changing environment environment with</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.289" end="00:06:24.150" style="s2">their habits aren&#39;t giving them good</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.960" end="00:06:26.009" style="s2">answers they have to actually think</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.150" end="00:06:28.259" style="s2">about the choices they&#39;re going to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.009" end="00:06:29.939" style="s2">and those those choices have</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.259" end="00:06:32.370" style="s2">consequences and those consequences land</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.939" end="00:06:34.110" style="s2">and possibly land quite significantly so</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:39.240" style="s2">that&#39;s one big piece yep</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.110" end="00:06:40.590" style="s2">continue ok next big piece what is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.240" end="00:06:41.969" style="s2">story about that&#39;s being addicts like</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.590" end="00:06:45.750" style="s2">what happened what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.969" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">and one of the things that I think is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:51.240" style="s2">kind of left hanging out and that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:55.409" style="s2">haven&#39;t really built a capacity of in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.240" end="00:06:58.110" style="s2">our current civilization is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.409" end="00:07:00.719" style="s2">recognition of the reality of something</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.110" end="00:07:03.089" style="s2">that is known as complexity this notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.719" end="00:07:04.740" style="s2">of what complexity really is and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.089" end="00:07:06.930" style="s2">important it is in fact in many ways how</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.740" end="00:07:09.389" style="s2">decisive it is and how we could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.930" end="00:07:11.729" style="s2">go forward as humans and live in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.389" end="00:07:13.650" style="s2">durable way and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.729" end="00:07:16.439" style="s2">characteristics of complexity is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.650" end="00:07:18.060" style="s2">notion of systems like complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.439" end="00:07:20.219" style="s2">they&#39;re systems and they hang together</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.060" end="00:07:22.580" style="s2">and very very subtle in interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.219" end="00:07:26.550" style="s2">ways and they affect each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.580" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">so typically we and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.550" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">pretty much everybody in the planet</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.599" end="00:07:31.589" style="s2">right now except for indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:33.870" style="s2">have used what&#39;s called a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.589" end="00:07:35.639" style="s2">approach to try to manage complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.870" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">systems and this is something I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.639" end="00:07:40.169" style="s2">harping on for a long time so I hope</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:42.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not boring but a simple complicated</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.169" end="00:07:45.419" style="s2">approach is like a silos you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.839" end="00:07:46.830" style="s2">bureaucracy yeah I&#39;ve got a you know an</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.419" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">academic gap ok at Department of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.830" end="00:07:50.819" style="s2">Mathematics and we got the Department of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:53.139" style="s2">Biology and I&#39;ve just divided reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.819" end="00:07:54.999" style="s2">into two distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.139" end="00:07:56.590" style="s2">and there&#39;s advantages to that I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.999" end="00:07:57.909" style="s2">specialize in mathematics and really</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.590" end="00:07:59.379" style="s2">focus and learn a lot and go deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.909" end="00:08:01.330" style="s2">analytically break it down to smaller</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.379" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">and smaller pieces but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.330" end="00:08:04.810" style="s2">disadvantage to that which is that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:06.490" style="s2">may be things about mathematics in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.810" end="00:08:08.289" style="s2">biology that actually are deeply related</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.490" end="00:08:09.699" style="s2">to each other and I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.289" end="00:08:11.110" style="s2">connections between them that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.699" end="00:08:12.939" style="s2">definitely part of reality reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.110" end="00:08:14.830" style="s2">they&#39;re not separate then I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.939" end="00:08:17.379" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s it that&#39;s the academic</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.830" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">environment in our social environment</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.379" end="00:08:24.279" style="s2">for example we have this notion that say</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:25.870" style="s2">the physical experience of getting a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.279" end="00:08:27.189" style="s2">virus that the actual human embodied</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.870" end="00:08:30.719" style="s2">experience of getting a virus getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.189" end="00:08:34.539" style="s2">sick the institutional structure called</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.719" end="00:08:37.779" style="s2">the medical system that is more that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.539" end="00:08:40.209" style="s2">responsible for that the media system</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.779" end="00:08:42.070" style="s2">that supports the way that we make sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.209" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">of our environment and the way they make</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.070" end="00:08:47.079" style="s2">choices and let&#39;s go with listen the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:48.910" style="s2">financial system our distinct right</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.079" end="00:08:51.180" style="s2">they&#39;re governed very differently the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.910" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">Federal Reserve does not have</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.180" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">responsibility for for hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:57.640" style="s2">Kaiser Permanente doesn&#39;t that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:09:01.060" style="s2">whole at a time specifically working out</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.640" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">what&#39;s going on MSNBC yeah well here we</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.060" end="00:09:05.649" style="s2">are in a situation where they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:07.480" style="s2">complicated they&#39;re in a complex they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.649" end="00:09:11.140" style="s2">implicated in each other and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.480" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">concrete we have a very specific you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.140" end="00:09:16.839" style="s2">know when the number of people who get</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:20.440" style="s2">sick exceeds a certain number that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.839" end="00:09:22.449" style="s2">the the logical as closely this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.440" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">systemic assumption of our hospitals how</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.449" end="00:09:26.649" style="s2">many ICU units how many doctors how many</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:28.750" style="s2">Bentall errors have we economically</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.649" end="00:09:31.750" style="s2">decided to put in place to support</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.750" end="00:09:36.430" style="s2">sickness when a particular event of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.750" end="00:09:37.540" style="s2">sickness overwhelms that number then we</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.430" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">actually begin to see what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.540" end="00:09:41.560" style="s2">phase transition in the medical system</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.240" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer the medical system now is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.560" end="00:09:46.149" style="s2">this big broken thing that&#39;s still in</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.240" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">harm all over the place yep and remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.149" end="00:09:48.370" style="s2">go sideways so it&#39;s not whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:50.709" style="s2">necessary if you get sick from</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.370" end="00:09:53.199" style="s2">coronavirus if you&#39;re in Seattle right</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.709" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">now and you get hit by a car you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.199" end="00:09:56.290" style="s2">actually much worse off than you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:58.110" style="s2">two weeks ago because the emergency room</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.290" end="00:10:00.940" style="s2">is filled with other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.110" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">cascades out capacity is no longer there</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.940" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">and there&#39;s a called externalities the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:06.840" style="s2">externalities go up nonlinearly in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:09.000" style="s2">phase drain</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.840" end="00:10:10.920" style="s2">right so I&#39;ve got some extra knowlet&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:12.779" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got enough beds and I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">enough doctors it&#39;s kind of like filling</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.779" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">up a cup with water as the cup gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:18.750" style="s2">filled with water I could just fill a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.310" end="00:10:20.490" style="s2">cup of water I can just keep pouring</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.750" end="00:10:23.160" style="s2">more sick people into it that&#39;s okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.490" end="00:10:25.500" style="s2">if I get a car wreck okay the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.160" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">operator or the ER goes from not as</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.500" end="00:10:30.029" style="s2">packed to more packed but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">okay but once I fill the cup with water</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.029" end="00:10:33.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a totally different ballgame</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:38.070" style="s2">now what happens is the sick person goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.990" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">from being less able to get access to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.070" end="00:10:42.750" style="s2">medical resources to possibly being</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:44.070" style="s2">unable to and die all right well okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.750" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">that&#39;s fine so we just learned about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.070" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">that so let&#39;s move to another one this</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">seems awfully less connected let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:53.279" style="s2">with the financial system well as it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">turns out when people are and those two</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:57.150" style="s2">implicate media in this as well when</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">people are getting a virus that&#39;s by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.150" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">way new and new is important because</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:03.510" style="s2">novelty is a mystery yeah then for</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.260" end="00:11:04.950" style="s2">example they start flying with their</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.510" end="00:11:06.150" style="s2">choices change local people&#39;s choices</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.950" end="00:11:07.740" style="s2">change because they have this notion</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.150" end="00:11:10.710" style="s2">this sense that oh I could get sick and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.740" end="00:11:12.390" style="s2">as the media convey is a particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.710" end="00:11:17.460" style="s2">narrative that influences their choices</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.390" end="00:11:19.170" style="s2">well as we go fly less airlines make</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.460" end="00:11:20.490" style="s2">less money and it&#39;s by the way just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.170" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">filling a cup again up to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.490" end="00:11:23.070" style="s2">level it doesn&#39;t matter that much but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:25.890" style="s2">passed a certain level the airlines</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.070" end="00:11:27.900" style="s2">system subsystem begins to break right</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.890" end="00:11:29.730" style="s2">they they have to just stop sending</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.900" end="00:11:31.020" style="s2">airplanes and of course there&#39;s cascade</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.730" end="00:11:34.740" style="s2">effects that people aren&#39;t traveling as</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.020" end="00:11:36.030" style="s2">much then restaurants and events don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.740" end="00:11:37.260" style="s2">have people who are in them and of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.030" end="00:11:39.089" style="s2">course the events might close down which</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.260" end="00:11:41.250" style="s2">has a feedback loop in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.089" end="00:11:43.260" style="s2">direction then you&#39;ve got the financial</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:45.390" style="s2">system the stock market is watching all</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">of this stuff it&#39;s like huh what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.390" end="00:11:48.150" style="s2">on like in China you know did the event</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">occurred in China across all these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.150" end="00:11:53.070" style="s2">dimensions the Chinese airline stocks</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:54.690" style="s2">went down before American airline stocks</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.070" end="00:11:56.820" style="s2">went down but the people who invest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.690" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">airline stocks go well this thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.820" end="00:11:59.550" style="s2">becomes a pandemic American Airlines</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:01.950" style="s2">starts in German airline stocks are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.550" end="00:12:04.440" style="s2">gonna go down so they start selling yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.950" end="00:12:06.209" style="s2">and you get this a panic response at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.440" end="00:12:08.730" style="s2">level of the financial system which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.209" end="00:12:10.709" style="s2">not like you get a response like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.730" end="00:12:12.660" style="s2">rational response if the economy is</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.709" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">gonna go gonna shrink so we need to not</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.660" end="00:12:15.510" style="s2">be paying as much for this stock but</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:18.000" style="s2">then as soon as the signal goes it goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.510" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">down yep and then just to be clear we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:21.720" style="s2">had a geopolitical consequence</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">we saw what happened oil prices and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.720" end="00:12:27.550" style="s2">whether or not that was a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">reaction like oh crap the economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.550" end="00:12:31.180" style="s2">shrinking surger demand for oil is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:32.829" style="s2">go down and we need to respond to it or</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.180" end="00:12:34.360" style="s2">was an offensive move</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.829" end="00:12:35.860" style="s2">hey this is chaos I should take</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.360" end="00:12:37.660" style="s2">advantage of the strategic opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.860" end="00:12:39.940" style="s2">and try to do something I come to grab</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.660" end="00:12:41.079" style="s2">market share by flushing the price and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.940" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">shutting that people who can&#39;t afford to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.079" end="00:12:44.949" style="s2">run at that price doesn&#39;t matter in</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.209" style="s2">either case that creates a shock wave</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.949" end="00:12:48.069" style="s2">effect in the financial system that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.209" end="00:12:49.779" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like big dislocation moves and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.069" end="00:12:52.120" style="s2">of course implications to cascade n2</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.779" end="00:12:53.560" style="s2">uncertainty which then feeds back into</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.120" end="00:12:56.199" style="s2">say the political system so that all</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.560" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">these things are connected and when</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.199" end="00:13:01.180" style="s2">they&#39;re operating normally we get very</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">complacent and we kind of forget that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.180" end="00:13:05.860" style="s2">have a deep deep responsibility that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">civilization that we live in is a rare</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.860" end="00:13:09.970" style="s2">and precious thing and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.529" end="00:13:10.569" style="s2">can tend to go about our day to day</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.970" end="00:13:12.790" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.569" end="00:13:15.339" style="s2">drinking $10 smoothies and not being</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:18.579" style="s2">sick here in the West at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.339" end="00:13:20.170" style="s2">pyramid in particular is singular in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.579" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">history has never happened before and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.170" end="00:13:25.569" style="s2">the baseline is it ain&#39;t the case and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:26.769" style="s2">we take a look at those I personally</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.569" end="00:13:27.970" style="s2">spend a lot of time let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.769" end="00:13:30.610" style="s2">these various systems that are so</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.970" end="00:13:33.250" style="s2">crucial in maintaining our our quality</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.610" end="00:13:34.089" style="s2">of life and I can tell you they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.250" end="00:13:36.189" style="s2">in great shape</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.089" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">alright they&#39;re not in good shape</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.189" end="00:13:42.130" style="s2">they&#39;ve gotten very very very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">and this is part of that notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.130" end="00:13:47.019" style="s2">delusion we&#39;ve become an addict to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:53.019" style="s2">particular lifestyle that is tries to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.019" end="00:13:53.649" style="s2">pit wealth against resilience and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.019" end="00:13:54.939" style="s2">uses a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.649" end="00:13:57.550" style="s2">should see in the middle so efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.939" end="00:13:59.110" style="s2">pulls resilience away and gives you</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.550" end="00:14:02.319" style="s2">wealth gives you what&#39;s called plenitude</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.110" end="00:14:06.220" style="s2">and that feels pretty cool for a while</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.319" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">right it&#39;s like taking a shot of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:10.629" style="s2">feta means you can this massive burst of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.459" style="s2">energy but you&#39;re pulling resources from</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.629" end="00:14:13.449" style="s2">the future into the present to get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.459" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">burst of energy you&#39;re pulling</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.449" end="00:14:17.439" style="s2">resilience out of your biological system</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">in exchange for a burst of productivity</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.439" end="00:14:24.309" style="s2">and by the way you can get addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:26.290" style="s2">it so it&#39;s a good metaphor and so here</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.309" end="00:14:28.420" style="s2">we are we&#39;re about to get a really</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.290" end="00:14:29.439" style="s2">serious like oh you know moment of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.420" end="00:14:31.569" style="s2">clarity we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna hit</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.439" end="00:14:33.850" style="s2">reality is punching us in the face and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.569" end="00:14:36.339" style="s2">in the sort of medium article on this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:37.869" style="s2">recently like yesterday saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.339" end="00:14:42.220" style="s2">the thing you need to be very clear that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.869" end="00:14:44.110" style="s2">the virus is a risk but it&#39;s one of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.220" end="00:14:46.179" style="s2">nine risks that are now emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.110" end="00:14:47.499" style="s2">there may be thirty risks tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.179" end="00:14:50.259" style="s2">because it&#39;s hard to see as different</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.499" end="00:14:51.629" style="s2">systems move things that were perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.259" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">fine under ordinary circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.629" end="00:14:56.110" style="s2">suddenly go outside of their tolerances</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:14:57.929" style="s2">and they add more chaos and burden on</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.110" end="00:15:01.149" style="s2">the rest of the overall system</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.929" end="00:15:04.929" style="s2">you mentioned in that article yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.149" end="00:15:06.879" style="s2">that you know things that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.929" end="00:15:08.649" style="s2">institution current civilization the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.879" end="00:15:09.730" style="s2">structures the ideas the habits the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.649" end="00:15:12.429" style="s2">feedback loops that are hanging</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:15.699" style="s2">everything together is in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.429" end="00:15:17.019" style="s2">evaporation mmm-hmm and and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.699" end="00:15:19.899" style="s2">start talking about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.019" end="00:15:23.139" style="s2">different Raptors like various areas</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.899" end="00:15:26.220" style="s2">that basically could you were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.139" end="00:15:28.209" style="s2">see it now like just start to crumble</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.220" end="00:15:29.649" style="s2">maybe we can talk about a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.209" end="00:15:32.920" style="s2">those right and go a little bit more in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.649" end="00:15:35.050" style="s2">detail if that&#39;s ok very concrete well</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.920" end="00:15:38.230" style="s2">one of the obvious ones is the medical</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.050" end="00:15:41.129" style="s2">system right yeah and you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.230" end="00:15:44.139" style="s2">already that you know let&#39;s say the beds</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.129" end="00:15:47.049" style="s2">now if they&#39;re you know overworked</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.139" end="00:15:48.519" style="s2">because they have more Cobin 19 people</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.049" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">coming in then somebody that gets an</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.519" end="00:15:53.170" style="s2">accident is no longer able to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:54.249" style="s2">support potentially right and at some</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.170" end="00:15:56.439" style="s2">point will get saturated there</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.249" end="00:16:00.699" style="s2">especially if the as the virus</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.439" end="00:16:03.900" style="s2">propagates what other medical system</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.699" end="00:16:06.450" style="s2">challenges do you see coming up</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.900" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">well they give you three no you actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.450" end="00:16:10.950" style="s2">let me give you four and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:13.410" style="s2">interesting related so one is doctors</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.950" end="00:16:14.760" style="s2">and nurses getting sick all right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.410" end="00:16:18.150" style="s2">seen this happen all over the place and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.760" end="00:16:19.710" style="s2">as it turns out in spite one we have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.150" end="00:16:20.820" style="s2">shortage of masks but the masks don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.710" end="00:16:23.640" style="s2">seem to work very well</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.820" end="00:16:25.110" style="s2">yeah nice so if a doctor is in theater</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.640" end="00:16:26.400" style="s2">really surrounded by a lot of sick</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.110" end="00:16:29.430" style="s2">people for a period of time and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.400" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">not wearing a full-on hazmat suit they</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.430" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">will get sick and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:36.870" style="s2">that you know 10 to 12 10 to 14 days</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:38.580" style="s2">later you&#39;re gonna have a start having</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.870" end="00:16:40.380" style="s2">doctors and nurses dropping out of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.580" end="00:16:43.350" style="s2">workforce you know so our actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.380" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">capacity of irreplaceable resources you</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.350" end="00:16:48.089" style="s2">can&#39;t make doctors faster yep</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:49.260" style="s2">starts to drop out that could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.089" end="00:16:51.720" style="s2">catastrophic but it&#39;s a really really</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.260" end="00:16:52.740" style="s2">big deal now I mentioned also Alice in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.720" end="00:16:55.080" style="s2">that essay that we can also think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.740" end="00:16:56.970" style="s2">in terms of nested layers so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.080" end="00:16:58.500" style="s2">for example in Seattle you get a real</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.970" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">issue like you run out of beds you run</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.500" end="00:17:02.220" style="s2">in a ventilator as you run out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">whatever but see how this part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.220" end="00:17:05.220" style="s2">Washington and if the rest of Washington</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:07.230" style="s2">is okay the rest of Washington can kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.220" end="00:17:10.380" style="s2">of like bring resources to bear but as</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.230" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">this as the pandemic expands more and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.380" end="00:17:14.339" style="s2">more places are implicated directly and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">their ability to act as a backstop for</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.339" end="00:17:17.130" style="s2">the rest for their age for their</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:21.329" style="s2">neighbors goes down so it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.130" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">issue yeah okay let&#39;s go is a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.329" end="00:17:26.699" style="s2">different one let&#39;s go to prisons</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">prisons are a really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.699" end="00:17:31.140" style="s2">challenging threat vector you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:33.179" style="s2">really do physical distancing some</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.140" end="00:17:34.679" style="s2">prisons they&#39;re designed not to be good</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.179" end="00:17:37.350" style="s2">at that I throw almost perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.679" end="00:17:38.580" style="s2">designed to expose everybody you know so</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.350" end="00:17:40.170" style="s2">you can get a lot of sick prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.580" end="00:17:41.850" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem and and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.170" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">gonna just by themselves each prison</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.850" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">holds more people that can be handled by</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:48.690" style="s2">it by an entire city&#39;s medical system</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:52.110" style="s2">generally speaking but guards are also</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.690" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">going to be exposed yeah and if you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.110" end="00:17:56.070" style="s2">sick guards or you get guards who</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:58.500" style="s2">suddenly are like I&#39;m not exposing my</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.070" end="00:18:00.210" style="s2">family to this and don&#39;t go to work then</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.500" end="00:18:03.000" style="s2">you actually said in the start having a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.210" end="00:18:03.690" style="s2">criminal or a prison fragility and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.000" end="00:18:05.820" style="s2">saw this in Italy</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.690" end="00:18:07.380" style="s2">my understanding is disciplic fifty</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.820" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">Italian prisons the last you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.380" end="00:18:11.560" style="s2">looked at it we&#39;re essentially being run</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:12.730" style="s2">by the prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.560" end="00:18:14.950" style="s2">now that has its own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.730" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">implications in terms of just you the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.950" end="00:18:18.730" style="s2">human consequences on the prisoners in</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:19.960" style="s2">the prison but you might imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.730" end="00:18:21.190" style="s2">couple of those prisons suddenly stopped</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.960" end="00:18:22.510" style="s2">being prisons and then they become</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.190" end="00:18:24.340" style="s2">places where a whole bunch of people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.510" end="00:18:26.440" style="s2">are infected spread and people who may</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.340" end="00:18:28.420" style="s2">in fact go to great lengths to not be</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.440" end="00:18:29.980" style="s2">quarantined yep and so you got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.420" end="00:18:31.900" style="s2">dissemination vector that&#39;s implicated</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.980" end="00:18:33.460" style="s2">that you can do the same thing with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.900" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">homeless right the homeless have been a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.460" end="00:18:39.640" style="s2">real real problem particularly in big</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:41.110" style="s2">cities like LA and San Francisco and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.640" end="00:18:44.050" style="s2">clear clearly are not good at dealing</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.110" end="00:18:46.150" style="s2">with that problem is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a human</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.050" end="00:18:48.700" style="s2">crisis and has been on the books for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.150" end="00:18:52.680" style="s2">long time and growing and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.700" end="00:18:54.490" style="s2">becoming a acute because again</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.680" end="00:18:56.350" style="s2">quarantine is not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.490" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">particularly well on folks for just</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.350" end="00:19:02.910" style="s2">living in tents in Skid Row in LA yep</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:05.290" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to act as</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.910" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">simultaneously a reservoir of potential</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.290" end="00:19:09.790" style="s2">infection for the rest of the population</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:11.770" style="s2">and in particular check this out</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.790" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">so let&#39;s move to the fourth example of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.770" end="00:19:15.940" style="s2">the medical domain let&#39;s say that we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:21.900" style="s2">in fact try to do something like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.940" end="00:19:23.490" style="s2">chinese-style hard quarantine right</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.900" end="00:19:25.590" style="s2">president comes on</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.490" end="00:19:26.910" style="s2">being says martial law is declared the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.590" end="00:19:30.440" style="s2">National Guard has been brought out</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.910" end="00:19:33.270" style="s2">everybody stay in your house yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.440" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">well the troops who are enforcing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.270" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">if they&#39;re not wearing hazmat suits are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:41.790" style="s2">now subject to being infected now as</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:43.140" style="s2">young adults who are probably pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.790" end="00:19:44.940" style="s2">healthy more or less than us they&#39;re big</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.140" end="00:19:47.429" style="s2">smokers they they&#39;re probably not</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.940" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">exposed to see like really serious risk</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.429" end="00:19:52.380" style="s2">of death although the the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">of getting sick are seriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.380" end="00:19:55.230" style="s2">non-trivial no matter what people you</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:58.380" style="s2">need to make clear this is not the kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.230" end="00:20:00.330" style="s2">of thing that you want to get but some</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.380" end="00:20:02.280" style="s2">of them are you taking off out of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.330" end="00:20:04.050" style="s2">awkward boards you may have some real</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.280" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">depletion of capacity chat your sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.050" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">your your wall is trying to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">quarantine is gonna be leaking in</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:10.110" style="s2">different places creating a stochastic</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.870" style="s2">possibility of just events occurring</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.110" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">across that barrier and of course every</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.870" end="00:20:16.170" style="s2">single one of those people they need</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:17.730" style="s2">resources they need food they need water</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.170" end="00:20:19.770" style="s2">they whip their families and they become</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.730" end="00:20:21.179" style="s2">potential vectors to spread it and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.770" end="00:20:22.860" style="s2">more you have them on the ground without</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.179" end="00:20:23.940" style="s2">hazmat suits the more you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.860" end="00:20:26.429" style="s2">actually creating a breaking your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.940" end="00:20:29.700" style="s2">quarantine all right yourself that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.429" end="00:20:31.950" style="s2">like there&#39;s like thousands of examples</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.700" end="00:20:34.530" style="s2">in that subdomain let&#39;s shift over to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.950" end="00:20:36.840" style="s2">the financial domain I was just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.530" end="00:20:38.760" style="s2">say that you know people are stopping</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.840" end="00:20:40.679" style="s2">working now right yeah blood looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.760" end="00:20:43.380" style="s2">from home well they&#39;re stopping working</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.679" end="00:20:46.920" style="s2">and certain industries like airlines</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.380" end="00:20:48.780" style="s2">hotels tourism all affected directly and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.920" end="00:20:52.260" style="s2">then multiple other industries are</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.780" end="00:20:55.080" style="s2">affected indirectly and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.260" end="00:20:56.790" style="s2">worry I think is you know first of all</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.080" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">if people are not working do they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.790" end="00:21:02.429" style="s2">the means to pay their bills mortgages</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:05.130" style="s2">and things of that sort as well as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.429" end="00:21:08.160" style="s2">just does the economy come to a halt and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.130" end="00:21:11.550" style="s2">it seems like it is yeah let&#39;s run a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.160" end="00:21:13.080" style="s2">couple things and I can again like try</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.550" end="00:21:14.820" style="s2">to try to think through the implications</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.080" end="00:21:17.550" style="s2">of this across a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.820" end="00:21:19.080" style="s2">numbers so something like 70% of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.550" end="00:21:21.900" style="s2">American population there&#39;s paycheck to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.080" end="00:21:23.580" style="s2">paycheck and I&#39;m not going to take that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.900" end="00:21:26.520" style="s2">as a humanitarian crisis I&#39;m gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.580" end="00:21:29.160" style="s2">that as an example of fragility I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.520" end="00:21:31.650" style="s2">be like self let&#39;s just be selfish</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.160" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s fragility because what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.650" end="00:21:36.210" style="s2">is that when something like this occurs</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:37.230" style="s2">and when the economy does shut down</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.210" end="00:21:39.410" style="s2">significantly</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.230" end="00:21:41.340" style="s2">big sectors of it that tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.410" end="00:21:43.380" style="s2">clustered with people who don&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.340" end="00:21:45.780" style="s2">to have a lot of job security like in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.380" end="00:21:48.419" style="s2">the restaurant industry you were going</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.780" end="00:21:53.690" style="s2">to very quickly begin having households</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.419" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">that have income less than their costs</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.690" end="00:21:57.270" style="s2">alpha times houses that have been kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.500" end="00:21:59.850" style="s2">of zero and cash reserves of zero</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.270" end="00:22:01.290" style="s2">yeah and in particular somebody just</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.850" end="00:22:02.820" style="s2">sent me a message recently that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.290" end="00:22:04.020" style="s2">like looking at about six weeks of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:06.990" style="s2">having something on the order of 30</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.020" end="00:22:10.200" style="s2">million men young men are 30 million</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.990" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">young men with no job no cash and no</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.200" end="00:22:17.100" style="s2">family mmm well they may decide to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">things that are not that are antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.100" end="00:22:22.650" style="s2">as they tend to when they&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:23.790" style="s2">circumstance and that&#39;s just a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.650" end="00:22:25.919" style="s2">effect right so you start having</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.790" end="00:22:28.169" style="s2">situations where people who literally</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.919" end="00:22:30.809" style="s2">don&#39;t have resources either at the level</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.169" end="00:22:33.090" style="s2">of suffering are you know gang kicked</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.809" end="00:22:34.620" style="s2">out of their houses or unable to feed</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.090" end="00:22:36.510" style="s2">themselves or having by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.620" end="00:22:38.760" style="s2">declining health because they have now</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.510" end="00:22:40.110" style="s2">high stress malnutrition which makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.760" end="00:22:41.340" style="s2">them increasingly large director to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.110" end="00:22:44.309" style="s2">six across a bunch of different fronts</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.340" end="00:22:47.179" style="s2">fYI you know historically that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.309" end="00:22:50.910" style="s2">four horsemen include that plague</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.179" end="00:22:52.500" style="s2">pestilence and famine are all part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.910" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">the same story because they feed back on</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.500" end="00:22:56.940" style="s2">each other right you get people get sick</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.530" style="s2">the crops aren&#39;t made people get hungry</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.940" end="00:23:02.940" style="s2">they get more easier to get sick you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.530" end="00:23:04.860" style="s2">a cycle okay let&#39;s do another one let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.940" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">go with supply chains all right we saw</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.860" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">this with China and this is this was</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.450" end="00:23:08.730" style="s2">something that we were looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:10.380" style="s2">while ago and then finally it became</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.730" end="00:23:12.750" style="s2">mainstream but of course supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.380" end="00:23:14.250" style="s2">go in all directions so now that Italy</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.750" end="00:23:16.020" style="s2">is shut down and Europe&#39;s getting rid of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.250" end="00:23:18.360" style="s2">gets shut down the u.s. soon will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.020" end="00:23:20.580" style="s2">shut down means that the whatever supply</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.360" end="00:23:22.020" style="s2">chains we control whether we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.580" end="00:23:23.429" style="s2">bottom of that but the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.020" end="00:23:27.390" style="s2">cascades back out to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.429" end="00:23:29.190" style="s2">world which just means more cycle</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.390" end="00:23:31.140" style="s2">dynamics and interruptions and slowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.190" end="00:23:32.070" style="s2">things down even if people were going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.140" end="00:23:34.020" style="s2">work there aren&#39;t going to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.070" end="00:23:36.210" style="s2">component parts and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.020" end="00:23:37.080" style="s2">demand chain and this demand demand</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.210" end="00:23:39.690" style="s2">chain going the opposite direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.080" end="00:23:41.790" style="s2">obviously the u.s. is still the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.690" end="00:23:44.429" style="s2">consumer of the world so to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.790" end="00:23:48.450" style="s2">which US consumption goes down or goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.429" end="00:23:51.240" style="s2">away in certain sectors I mean a friend</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.450" end="00:23:53.070" style="s2">of mine does sophistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.240" end="00:23:55.170" style="s2">financial stuff and he creates these</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.070" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">trading pairs and he did a trading pair</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.170" end="00:24:01.770" style="s2">with jets which is airline stocks as an</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.830" end="00:24:03.570" style="s2">ETF and then zoom conferencing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.770" end="00:24:06.630" style="s2">basically long zoom conferencing short</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.570" end="00:24:11.070" style="s2">air current airplanes yeah long net flix</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.630" end="00:24:12.809" style="s2">short the NBA yeah but of course this F</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.070" end="00:24:14.490" style="s2">cascade effects so people all over the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.809" end="00:24:16.230" style="s2">world are not going to be impacted by</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.490" end="00:24:18.990" style="s2">crashing demand for things that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.230" end="00:24:21.059" style="s2">produce in their environment and so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.990" end="00:24:22.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.059" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve been a lot of reports put out by</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.590" end="00:24:25.980" style="s2">very sophisticated organizations like</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:28.950" style="s2">Goldman Sachs they&#39;re sort of projecting</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.980" end="00:24:29.970" style="s2">certain and complete IR consequences</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.950" end="00:24:32.730" style="s2">they actually they&#39;re not good there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.970" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">their dire consequences but I&#39;ll put put</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.730" end="00:24:38.760" style="s2">my my my neck on the chopping block and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">say that a I believe there was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.760" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">projection and I by the way I could be I</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:44.940" style="s2">can&#39;t remember we&#39;re calling it</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:48.600" style="s2">incorrectly of a reduction of global GDP</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.940" end="00:24:51.059" style="s2">growth to two percent yeah but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.600" end="00:24:54.330" style="s2">really that seems very optimistic to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.059" end="00:24:57.210" style="s2">very often I was just going to say if I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.330" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">mean look right now we&#39;re probably at in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.210" end="00:25:03.179" style="s2">the very early days in the US right if</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:06.390" style="s2">this takes conservatively three months</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.179" end="00:25:09.179" style="s2">maybe more isn&#39;t that half our GDP in</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.390" end="00:25:11.970" style="s2">the year that&#39;s gone and then how we</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.179" end="00:25:13.230" style="s2">expecting I mean so that from if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.970" end="00:25:15.210" style="s2">even talking growth I think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.230" end="00:25:18.270" style="s2">recede actually not probably growth</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.210" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">right well yeah and again remember we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.270" end="00:25:23.190" style="s2">talking about fragility so if this was</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:25.740" style="s2">like the the thriving American economy</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.190" end="00:25:27.450" style="s2">in the mid-60s that&#39;s one thing this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.740" end="00:25:29.130" style="s2">an American American economy that more</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.450" end="00:25:30.660" style="s2">or less fell apart the seams in two</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.130" end="00:25:32.309" style="s2">thousand eight is what how it was held</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.660" end="00:25:35.220" style="s2">together with heroic in doses of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.309" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">stimulants levels of methamphetamines</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.220" end="00:25:42.450" style="s2">that would make a an addict shudder and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:44.580" style="s2">now is getting hammered again right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.450" end="00:25:46.140" style="s2">things are already breaking let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.580" end="00:25:49.530" style="s2">obviously the Federal Reserve&#39;s response</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.140" end="00:25:53.070" style="s2">over the past couple of days is it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.530" end="00:25:54.660" style="s2">called not measured I mean they&#39;d they</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.070" end="00:25:56.730" style="s2">dressed drop to zero but they obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.660" end="00:25:58.710" style="s2">had zero effect on the market to markets</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.730" end="00:26:00.419" style="s2">like so what yeah you would that with</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.710" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">where else you got right they dropped</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.419" end="00:26:04.450" style="s2">five trillion dollars in commitments to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:06.730" style="s2">the repo market</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.450" end="00:26:08.260" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s out of control it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.730" end="00:26:10.200" style="s2">absurd but it&#39;s an enormous amount and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.260" end="00:26:13.390" style="s2">so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening is is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.200" end="00:26:15.490" style="s2">unfortunately addiction to stimulants</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.390" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">has that half-life you have to get more</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.490" end="00:26:19.210" style="s2">to get the same hit exactly and now</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:20.830" style="s2">we&#39;re running up now we&#39;re running into</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.210" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">into headwinds right we&#39;re not just sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.830" end="00:26:24.010" style="s2">of sitting still we&#39;ve got all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">things coming at us and like I said you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.010" end="00:26:27.070" style="s2">know the geopolitical stuff is there</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:30.730" style="s2">you know the geopolitical situation is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.070" end="00:26:33.070" style="s2">one where everybody&#39;s kind of waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.730" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">see like okay well how do i as my</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.070" end="00:26:37.150" style="s2">position get better you know Russia</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.310" style="s2">always is looking to play a chess game</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.150" end="00:26:41.350" style="s2">that&#39;s China is always looking to play a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.310" end="00:26:43.780" style="s2">Go game right our current president</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.350" end="00:26:44.830" style="s2">apparently likes to play poker but</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.780" end="00:26:47.710" style="s2">everyone&#39;s trying to figure out how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.830" end="00:26:49.260" style="s2">they get more chips or more what they</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.710" end="00:26:51.910" style="s2">call dingo their little colored pieces</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.260" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">we&#39;re more territory on the board for</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.910" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">their team yeah and unfortunately crisis</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:01.110" style="s2">breeds opportunity and in that context</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.320" end="00:27:03.640" style="s2">all kinds of things are going on like</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.110" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">disinfo is increasing rapidly which</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.640" end="00:27:08.530" style="s2">creates all kinds of decreases</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">probability know what&#39;s going on three</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.530" end="00:27:12.970" style="s2">of strategic alliances are shifting I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.390" end="00:27:14.950" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot so so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.970" end="00:27:16.600" style="s2">the sense making side of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.950" end="00:27:19.450" style="s2">interesting right I mean even the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.600" end="00:27:21.970" style="s2">position of the US government I mean has</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.450" end="00:27:25.450" style="s2">shifted so drastically in just weeks</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.970" end="00:27:27.130" style="s2">yeah well why is it that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.450" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">having a hard time making sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.130" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">and and why is it that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:32.770" style="s2">make sense of it a lot faster a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:34.180" style="s2">comprehensively than perhaps other</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.770" end="00:27:38.110" style="s2">people what&#39;s the difference in sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.180" end="00:27:39.610" style="s2">making that&#39;s happening well so what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.110" end="00:27:41.970" style="s2">the things is clearly happening and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.610" end="00:27:45.490" style="s2">impacting everybody&#39;s velocity</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.970" end="00:27:47.320" style="s2">things are happening fast and this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.490" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">that whole exponential curve right</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.320" end="00:27:50.290" style="s2">people that I said like you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:51.490" style="s2">it if humanity humanity&#39;s biggest</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.290" end="00:27:53.140" style="s2">challenge right now is they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.490" end="00:27:54.790" style="s2">the exponential curve something like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.140" end="00:27:57.040" style="s2">missing the quote but we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.790" end="00:27:59.620" style="s2">that yeah and so and I see it actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.040" end="00:28:02.980" style="s2">oftentimes in just like on social media</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.620" end="00:28:04.780" style="s2">you know there&#39;s only been one case why</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.980" end="00:28:06.160" style="s2">does that matter how can that possibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.780" end="00:28:07.420" style="s2">matter that&#39;s a thousand case it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.160" end="00:28:10.360" style="s2">could that possibly matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.420" end="00:28:12.790" style="s2">and there&#39;s truly only people who have</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.360" end="00:28:15.430" style="s2">have some facts like haven&#39;t had an</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.790" end="00:28:17.530" style="s2">embodied experience with exponential</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.430" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">that had the ability to go yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.530" end="00:28:20.830" style="s2">will thousand become</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.340" end="00:28:22.090" style="s2">a million in two months yeah and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.830" end="00:28:23.740" style="s2">million by the way becomes everybody one</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.090" end="00:28:26.740" style="s2">month later like that&#39;s the thing I bet</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.740" end="00:28:30.789" style="s2">you know that thought experiment I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.740" end="00:28:32.380" style="s2">got a petri dish and I put exactly one</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.789" end="00:28:35.350" style="s2">bacteria in the center of the petri dish</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.380" end="00:28:38.140" style="s2">and the next the next day or the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.350" end="00:28:41.950" style="s2">hour it doubles and it takes six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.140" end="00:28:43.270" style="s2">to cover half the petri dish how much</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.950" end="00:28:46.809" style="s2">longer does it take to cover the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.270" end="00:28:47.140" style="s2">petri dish yeah just few more days one</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.809" end="00:28:50.380" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.140" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">no no one hour that&#39;s the thing right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.380" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s doubling every hour that&#39;s true the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:57.130" style="s2">first six weeks is doubling from a small</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:58.779" style="s2">base until it covers half but once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.130" end="00:29:01.720" style="s2">covered half the next doubling which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.779" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">exactly one hour it goes the whole so</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.720" end="00:29:05.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like you jump out of an airplane</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:07.929" style="s2">your body your brain is a use to moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.890" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2">vertically at real velocity it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.929" end="00:29:11.529" style="s2">I think ground rush so you look down the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:13.419" style="s2">ground since for our way for our way for</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.529" end="00:29:14.860" style="s2">our way far away you hit it that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.419" end="00:29:17.049" style="s2">a thing that they trained you with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.860" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">like we&#39;re experiencing ground rush in</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.049" end="00:29:20.890" style="s2">viral space because it just moves it a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">rate that we don&#39;t make sense up and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.890" end="00:29:27.130" style="s2">then what&#39;s happening of course is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:29.169" style="s2">the virtually nobody is trained in their</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.130" end="00:29:32.049" style="s2">day-to-day lives to be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.169" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">complexity so we&#39;ve got velocity you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.049" end="00:29:36.220" style="s2">got complexity going on simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">so you just get surprised you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.220" end="00:29:40.029" style="s2">like a you know measuring firefighters</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:41.860" style="s2">where they&#39;re to focusing on the fire</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.029" end="00:29:44.440" style="s2">they&#39;re focusing on the fire and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.860" end="00:29:45.789" style="s2">suddenly gosh I don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.440" end="00:29:47.740" style="s2">movie they&#39;re I invented for like a a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.789" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">plague of locusts just shows up out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.740" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">nowhere and starts like eating their</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">their hoses like we were going to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:55.029" style="s2">with a local it&#39;s like what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:58.659" style="s2">it&#39;s like that kind of thing now in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.029" end="00:30:02.049" style="s2">case I have kind of three things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.659" end="00:30:05.140" style="s2">have supported me the one is I started</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.049" end="00:30:07.210" style="s2">out as an entrepreneur so at the startup</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.140" end="00:30:09.669" style="s2">club like a startup tech entrepreneur so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.210" end="00:30:10.990" style="s2">things like pace like pace of change in</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.669" end="00:30:12.610" style="s2">fact specifically exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.990" end="00:30:15.580" style="s2">where things that I learned hands-on</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.610" end="00:30:17.260" style="s2">yeah and complexity like having to deal</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.580" end="00:30:18.909" style="s2">with multiple different modal changes</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.260" end="00:30:21.100" style="s2">like dealing with finance and legal and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.909" end="00:30:22.090" style="s2">technology and marketing and HR like all</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.100" end="00:30:23.350" style="s2">these different things and having to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.090" end="00:30:24.820" style="s2">able to state switch between them and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.350" end="00:30:26.409" style="s2">notice how they said back into each</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.820" end="00:30:27.820" style="s2">other yep and I wasn&#39;t by the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.409" end="00:30:29.110" style="s2">trained I didn&#39;t go to business school</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.820" end="00:30:31.570" style="s2">or anything like that so I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.110" end="00:30:32.269" style="s2">learned it on the streets as it were so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.570" end="00:30:33.979" style="s2">I kind of had</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.269" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">build competence to do it in general</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.979" end="00:30:38.839" style="s2">here and then when I quit being an</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:41.359" style="s2">entrepreneur I didn&#39;t just go hang out</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.839" end="00:30:42.440" style="s2">at fancy Islands I joined the board of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.359" end="00:30:44.029" style="s2">company called the Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.440" end="00:30:46.429" style="s2">which happens to be the pioneers in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.029" end="00:30:47.690" style="s2">complex system science so I got a chance</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.429" end="00:30:49.820" style="s2">to say okay all that stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.690" end="00:30:52.659" style="s2">experienced firsthand let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.820" end="00:30:57.349" style="s2">the theory how does this theory work and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.659" end="00:30:59.359" style="s2">then about ten years ago I got very</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.349" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">concerned about the state of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.359" end="00:31:02.839" style="s2">as I begin digging into each these</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:04.969" style="s2">systems and asking very smart people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.839" end="00:31:06.909" style="s2">are domain experts about say like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.969" end="00:31:09.349" style="s2">know nuclear proliferation or</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.909" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">concentrations of heavy metals in very</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.349" end="00:31:14.629" style="s2">specific biological niches they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:15.889" style="s2">wow yeah it&#39;s actually really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.629" end="00:31:17.839" style="s2">getting worse fast like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.889" end="00:31:20.389" style="s2">fragility in the domain that I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.839" end="00:31:22.190" style="s2">about and I notice is the two things</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.389" end="00:31:23.599" style="s2">every single one of these experts that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.190" end="00:31:25.579" style="s2">talked to was saying more or less the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.599" end="00:31:27.139" style="s2">same thing and if I asked them about</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.579" end="00:31:28.940" style="s2">another domain that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.139" end="00:31:31.339" style="s2">familiar with they were sure there was</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.940" end="00:31:32.209" style="s2">very surprised interested did you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.339" end="00:31:34.190" style="s2">about this sort of it here they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.209" end="00:31:35.929" style="s2">no good I had no idea because you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.190" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">siloed we&#39;re stuck in vertical</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.929" end="00:31:38.899" style="s2">disciplines and we don&#39;t cross</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:40.369" style="s2">communicate so about 10 years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.899" end="00:31:41.239" style="s2">basically just took it upon myself to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.369" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">start trying to learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.239" end="00:31:45.889" style="s2">precisely what these kinds of things are</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:48.950" style="s2">about and had been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.889" end="00:31:52.249" style="s2">talking about trying to work to address</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.950" end="00:31:53.659" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now so something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.249" end="00:31:56.029" style="s2">anything special other than just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.659" end="00:31:56.690" style="s2">sheer circumstance that I was prepared</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.029" end="00:32:00.499" style="s2">for this event</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.690" end="00:32:03.499" style="s2">you saw it coming you also knew that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.499" end="00:32:06.649" style="s2">this is one of those phase shift phase</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.499" end="00:32:08.329" style="s2">transition type of moments and now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.649" end="00:32:09.950" style="s2">talk about what you see playing out and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.329" end="00:32:11.570" style="s2">we talked about some of the risks in</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.950" end="00:32:15.259" style="s2">terms of you know medical financial</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.570" end="00:32:18.200" style="s2">government so on what is a month later</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.259" end="00:32:21.649" style="s2">look like to you like you know where do</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.200" end="00:32:23.929" style="s2">you see the world going so we be</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.649" end="00:32:25.159" style="s2">prepared for that we&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.929" end="00:32:26.959" style="s2">thinking about are considering right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.159" end="00:32:30.229" style="s2">right so let me just kind of put it in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.959" end="00:32:32.179" style="s2">it first like a visual metaphor and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.229" end="00:32:36.229" style="s2">say some scenarios so the visual</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.179" end="00:32:41.749" style="s2">metaphor is let&#39;s say I have a marble</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.229" end="00:32:44.119" style="s2">and I&#39;m rolling it on like a glass table</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.749" end="00:32:45.830" style="s2">but the glass table has a big groove in</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.119" end="00:32:47.570" style="s2">it I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.830" end="00:32:49.429" style="s2">kind of very easily predict where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.570" end="00:32:50.840" style="s2">marbles gonna go and it&#39;s gonna get into</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.429" end="00:32:51.500" style="s2">that groove and it&#39;s gonna follow the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.840" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">grooves down</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.500" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">I missed the groove steep enough it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:56.299" style="s2">actually quite difficult to get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:58.360" style="s2">marble to move anywhere but the groove</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.299" end="00:33:01.190" style="s2">once it&#39;s in it it&#39;s stuck in it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.360" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">okay what you see is the the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.190" end="00:33:05.000" style="s2">language of science it means a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:07.370" style="s2">significant activation energy as</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.000" end="00:33:09.169" style="s2">necessary to change the trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.370" end="00:33:11.000" style="s2">the system the system in this case is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.169" end="00:33:14.450" style="s2">just the marble and its trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.000" end="00:33:16.309" style="s2">that path but I imagined that what</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.450" end="00:33:18.230" style="s2">happens is is that as the marbles</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.309" end="00:33:21.529" style="s2">rolling down to the groove the groove</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.230" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">gets shallower and shallower so less</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.529" end="00:33:25.250" style="s2">than less activation energy is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">to move it out of the groove and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.250" end="00:33:27.980" style="s2">imagine actually there&#39;s a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.639" style="s2">where the group disappears completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.980" end="00:33:33.889" style="s2">and it&#39;s on a perfectly smooth table</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.639" end="00:33:35.240" style="s2">absolutely perfectly smooth and now you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.889" end="00:33:36.610" style="s2">can notice if you&#39;ve ever experienced</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.240" end="00:33:39.940" style="s2">anything like this before</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.610" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">it could go anywhere yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.940" end="00:33:43.700" style="s2">projectory now becomes almost completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">unpredictable your vacuum moved into a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.700" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">chaos state all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:51.169" style="s2">so well that is a visual metaphor what</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at right now is some</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.169" end="00:33:57.230" style="s2">scenarios our scenarios where the things</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:34:02.299" style="s2">that are happening are kind of lowering</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.230" end="00:34:04.549" style="s2">the the side to that that groove and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.299" end="00:34:06.350" style="s2">the marble could get kicked out of it so</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.549" end="00:34:08.089" style="s2">this is a phase transition each each one</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:09.830" style="s2">of these subsystems is its own its own</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.089" end="00:34:11.480" style="s2">groove so the medical groove once</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.830" end="00:34:12.619" style="s2">medical overwhelm happens it gets the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.480" end="00:34:14.419" style="s2">marble gets kicked out of that groove</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.619" end="00:34:16.310" style="s2">and with a different level of energy</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.419" end="00:34:23.500" style="s2">there&#39;s more uncertainty in the system</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.310" end="00:34:27.020" style="s2">yeah now there&#39;s one big scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.500" end="00:34:28.849" style="s2">the powers that be and the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.020" end="00:34:30.740" style="s2">are capacities is people to come</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.849" end="00:34:33.619" style="s2">together and do stuff hold together</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.740" end="00:34:35.720" style="s2">under all of this and after some period</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.619" end="00:34:36.770" style="s2">of time we&#39;re on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.720" end="00:34:38.810" style="s2">something that we can all remember and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.770" end="00:34:40.129" style="s2">talk about and so structural changes</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.810" end="00:34:42.619" style="s2">have happened but more or less we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.129" end="00:34:48.139" style="s2">still in the groove sure somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.619" end="00:34:50.270" style="s2">the 2008 yeah yeah yeah some people lost</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.139" end="00:34:51.589" style="s2">money big changes were made at the end</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.270" end="00:34:52.220" style="s2">of the day the bigger thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.589" end="00:34:55.429" style="s2">stayed the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.220" end="00:34:56.690" style="s2">that&#39;s a some number of scenarios I</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.429" end="00:34:58.339" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the percentage chances</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.690" end="00:34:59.580" style="s2">of that but it&#39;s you know it exists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.339" end="00:35:02.070" style="s2">there in his pits</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.580" end="00:35:04.350" style="s2">anyways the more the more the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.070" end="00:35:06.840" style="s2">plausible scenarios sure now of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.350" end="00:35:09.810" style="s2">as the as this as this as the situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.840" end="00:35:12.810" style="s2">continues to develop this creates</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.810" end="00:35:15.300" style="s2">opportunity for change right and so this</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.810" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">is one of the questions is agency who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.300" end="00:35:18.210" style="s2">actually per to coming into the system</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:20.010" style="s2">trying to move things around like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.210" end="00:35:21.900" style="s2">Saudi Russian oil thing that was people</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.010" end="00:35:24.150" style="s2">trying to actually take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.900" end="00:35:25.890" style="s2">chaos or take advantage of crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.150" end="00:35:28.380" style="s2">say oh hey maybe I can shift this thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.890" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">a lot because leverage is there yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.380" end="00:35:31.650" style="s2">one of the questions is gonna be what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:33.330" style="s2">else happens there what else happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.650" end="00:35:35.910" style="s2">that&#39;s driven by people by agents</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.330" end="00:35:37.260" style="s2">deliberately injecting more chaos into</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.910" end="00:35:39.120" style="s2">the system because they want to shift</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.260" end="00:35:43.380" style="s2">the system in their preferred direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.120" end="00:35:45.750" style="s2">right now if they do that they might and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.380" end="00:35:47.220" style="s2">we may not notice it but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.750" end="00:35:49.230" style="s2">circumstances where particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.220" end="00:35:51.240" style="s2">injections create cascade effects there</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.230" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">there may there are a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.240" end="00:35:56.070" style="s2">scenarios where things actually spiral</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.200" style="s2">out of control or the the the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.070" end="00:36:00.210" style="s2">complexity is changing everyday to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.200" end="00:36:01.590" style="s2">point where like we try to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.210" end="00:36:05.270" style="s2">problem in our various solution actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.590" end="00:36:09.000" style="s2">creates more problems over here you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.270" end="00:36:11.100" style="s2">so in that case risk of information and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.000" end="00:36:12.600" style="s2">disinformation all having an effect here</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.100" end="00:36:14.310" style="s2">is that&#39;s a big one that&#39;s a really big</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.600" end="00:36:15.930" style="s2">one misinformation disinformation which</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.310" end="00:36:17.430" style="s2">is sort of a primary weapon in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.930" end="00:36:19.050" style="s2">modern era yeah and we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.430" end="00:36:20.760" style="s2">susceptible to it because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.050" end="00:36:24.180" style="s2">trustworthy institutions we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.760" end="00:36:26.280" style="s2">lost trust of our institutions and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.180" end="00:36:27.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t build new ways to be good at</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.280" end="00:36:29.250" style="s2">making sense in the modern information</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.960" end="00:36:30.390" style="s2">environment so it&#39;s sort of like right</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.250" end="00:36:33.000" style="s2">in the middle of a transition of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.390" end="00:36:36.870" style="s2">capacity and it&#39;s very vulnerable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.000" end="00:36:38.550" style="s2">and so you know they can world World War</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.870" end="00:36:41.790" style="s2">two they have like the loose lips sink</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.550" end="00:36:43.130" style="s2">ships this was something more like see</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.790" end="00:36:45.630" style="s2">something say something or even better</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.130" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">tell the truth it&#39;s probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.630" end="00:36:49.010" style="s2">important thing right now like right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:51.570" style="s2">the moral lesson not to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.010" end="00:36:53.010" style="s2">and so yeah I&#39;ve actually talked through</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.570" end="00:36:55.260" style="s2">a couple of folks about it so in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.010" end="00:36:56.430" style="s2">context like this let&#39;s go the first</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.260" end="00:36:58.410" style="s2">scenario is that we kind of muddle</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.430" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">through and we&#39;ll be able to know like</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.410" end="00:37:04.050" style="s2">well we&#39;ll see if the medical systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:05.490" style="s2">start popping and and there can that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.050" end="00:37:07.050" style="s2">that financial system starts to move out</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.490" end="00:37:08.730" style="s2">it at our you know in the month two</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.050" end="00:37:10.230" style="s2">months you know either settles down or</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.730" end="00:37:11.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t and if it doesn&#39;t think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.230" end="00:37:12.180" style="s2">just continue to be really really really</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.640" end="00:37:15.480" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.180" end="00:37:16.859" style="s2">now generally speaking I can simplify</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.480" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">generally speaking outside of muddle</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.859" end="00:37:20.789" style="s2">through you actually have two possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.529" style="s2">major clusters of scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.789" end="00:37:25.369" style="s2">one&#39;s really bad and one&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.529" end="00:37:27.779" style="s2">really good I think is opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.369" end="00:37:30.089" style="s2">the determinant of that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.779" end="00:37:32.430" style="s2">something I think very powerful and very</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.089" end="00:37:35.130" style="s2">fundamental and it&#39;s it&#39;s very simple</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.430" end="00:37:37.670" style="s2">and the metaphor uses is the depression</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.130" end="00:37:41.390" style="s2">and in Germany and the United States</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.670" end="00:37:44.839" style="s2">okay sir so the Great Depression hits</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.390" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">financial crisis hits stock public</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.839" end="00:37:48.839" style="s2">market explodes and actually happened in</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:51.539" style="s2">both places happen all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.839" end="00:37:53.789" style="s2">but it happened the US and Germany then</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.539" end="00:37:55.319" style="s2">in the u.s. it was a big deal right the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.789" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">financial system was blown up the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.319" end="00:37:59.849" style="s2">economic system was hammered people were</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">really seriously out of work and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.849" end="00:38:02.700" style="s2">impoverished people were starving</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:06.150" style="s2">literally starving to death</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.700" end="00:38:09.690" style="s2">my bad stuff was happened but at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.150" end="00:38:12.270" style="s2">level of community it hung together and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.690" end="00:38:13.950" style="s2">got stronger neighbor helped neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.270" end="00:38:15.930" style="s2">people pulled together they realized</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.950" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">that they had a common wheel they had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.930" end="00:38:19.289" style="s2">common wealth that they all had</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.940" end="00:38:22.020" style="s2">collective responsibility to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.289" end="00:38:25.049" style="s2">and more or less on the United States</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.020" end="00:38:27.480" style="s2">that fabric the foundational fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.049" end="00:38:29.460" style="s2">civilization actually came together and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.480" end="00:38:31.650" style="s2">got stronger okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.460" end="00:38:35.339" style="s2">people did not atomized and become</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.650" end="00:38:37.740" style="s2">us-versus-them they became we and on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.339" end="00:38:39.690" style="s2">basis of we economic and financial</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.740" end="00:38:41.190" style="s2">questions can be solved rights are</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.690" end="00:38:44.190" style="s2">really cool things that we use to solve</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.190" end="00:38:47.579" style="s2">problems community is foundational all</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.190" end="00:38:49.010" style="s2">right now switch over to Germany now</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.579" end="00:38:51.510" style="s2">poor Germany had been dealt a bad hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.010" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">and wasn&#39;t one they got absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.510" end="00:38:56.279" style="s2">hammered their old legacy Imperial</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:57.960" style="s2">governor and the Kaiser had been booted</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.279" end="00:38:59.309" style="s2">so they were sitting on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.960" end="00:39:01.890" style="s2">Weimar Republic which didn&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.309" end="00:39:03.690" style="s2">of legitimate steam was actually run</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.890" end="00:39:05.339" style="s2">through with all kinds of very</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.690" end="00:39:06.900" style="s2">hyperbolic competing groups who are much</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.339" end="00:39:07.980" style="s2">more interested in fighting each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.900" end="00:39:12.210" style="s2">than trying to actually do the right</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.980" end="00:39:14.549" style="s2">thing for the whole so their financial</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.210" end="00:39:17.309" style="s2">system got torn through their economic</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.549" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">system got hammered but their community</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.309" end="00:39:21.329" style="s2">fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:22.559" style="s2">we became us versus them get one began</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.329" end="00:39:24.839" style="s2">looking out for their own interests</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.559" end="00:39:26.430" style="s2">withdrawing from the Commonwealth which</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.839" end="00:39:28.380" style="s2">made the financial and economic</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.430" end="00:39:31.349" style="s2">systems even more fragile which being</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.380" end="00:39:32.819" style="s2">deposited a downward spiral and of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.349" end="00:39:35.369" style="s2">course he then had a transition into</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.819" end="00:39:35.700" style="s2">Nazism right which is a very bad place</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.369" end="00:39:36.990" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.700" end="00:39:38.790" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying by the way so</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.990" end="00:39:40.200" style="s2">Venezuela is a similar dynamic in</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.790" end="00:39:42.030" style="s2">another direction right you either got</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.200" end="00:39:44.099" style="s2">really serious hardcore bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.030" end="00:39:47.160" style="s2">authoritarianism or really serious</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.099" end="00:39:48.839" style="s2">hardcore bad chaos and then kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.160" end="00:39:50.579" style="s2">threatens the other right the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.839" end="00:39:52.380" style="s2">chaos the law student says well I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.579" end="00:39:53.910" style="s2">rather have a authoritarian the threat</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.380" end="00:39:55.530" style="s2">of at or thora Tyrion can lead to chaos</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.910" end="00:39:58.440" style="s2">it&#39;s either of those are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.530" end="00:40:00.569" style="s2">equivalently bad places to be sure and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.440" end="00:40:00.839" style="s2">so in many ways like the balls in our</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.569" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">Court</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.839" end="00:40:06.990" style="s2">as people as individuals at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:11.970" style="s2">the days its if we are able to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.990" end="00:40:15.690" style="s2">a community level feel we feel on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.970" end="00:40:18.869" style="s2">ground yep is essential for seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.690" end="00:40:20.670" style="s2">we are able to weather the storm and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.869" end="00:40:22.260" style="s2">really what what direction we come out</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.670" end="00:40:23.970" style="s2">of it at the end of the day that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.260" end="00:40:27.230" style="s2">that&#39;s right and this is so it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.970" end="00:40:28.980" style="s2">these things where the die is not cast</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.230" end="00:40:30.210" style="s2">right it&#39;s in our hands</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.980" end="00:40:34.500" style="s2">I remember this great scene from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.210" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">movie Apollo 13 yeah where uh the guy</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.500" end="00:40:38.339" style="s2">from Westworld Edie something he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:40.440" style="s2">guy who&#39;s like we&#39;re in the best in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.339" end="00:40:42.030" style="s2">tie and in the background or the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.440" end="00:40:43.589" style="s2">the the kind of the more bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.030" end="00:40:44.790" style="s2">but the administrative heads at the guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.589" end="00:40:46.680" style="s2">were at his bosses but aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.790" end="00:40:48.089" style="s2">responsible sitting in the back talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.680" end="00:40:49.799" style="s2">and they&#39;re like all the big storms</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.089" end="00:40:51.930" style="s2">coming and with all these things failing</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.799" end="00:40:53.460" style="s2">and blabbity blah it&#39;s like yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.930" end="00:40:55.740" style="s2">this is gonna be the greatest disaster</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.460" end="00:40:57.420" style="s2">in NASA history he like tightens his tie</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.740" end="00:40:59.160" style="s2">and turns and says gentlemen I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.420" end="00:41:01.140" style="s2">this is gonna be our finest hour and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.160" end="00:41:03.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the difference right the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.140" end="00:41:04.770" style="s2">difference is he was committed he</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.450" end="00:41:06.990" style="s2">was gonna make it work and in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.770" end="00:41:09.540" style="s2">context crisis is an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.990" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">building entirely new good things and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.540" end="00:41:13.730" style="s2">there remember why not but back to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:16.380" style="s2">beginning this crisis is not the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.730" end="00:41:19.530" style="s2">this crisis is a symptom of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.380" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">that we are addicts we are addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.530" end="00:41:26.190" style="s2">extracting Clini tude in exchange for</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:28.460" style="s2">fragility yep and the good news is you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.190" end="00:41:31.140" style="s2">can actually have both abundance and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:33.329" style="s2">resilience and those two are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.140" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">compatible there&#39;s a place to go which</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.329" end="00:41:37.559" style="s2">is actually based upon very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.180" style="s2">building more we unless us versus them</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.559" end="00:41:39.960" style="s2">well you actually get to have abundance</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.180" end="00:41:41.790" style="s2">Andrews</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.960" end="00:41:44.610" style="s2">and you completely can deal with these</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.790" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">kinds of problems enduring and and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.610" end="00:41:48.420" style="s2">we today we&#39;re talking about it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:50.610" style="s2">community level but really we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.420" end="00:41:53.670" style="s2">talking we at the global level right one</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.610" end="00:41:55.710" style="s2">of the one of the you know criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.670" end="00:41:58.050" style="s2">the way this crisis has been handled is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.710" end="00:41:59.370" style="s2">that the us used to be the leader in</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.050" end="00:42:01.610" style="s2">terms of getting everybody to work</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.370" end="00:42:03.660" style="s2">together a global on a global plane</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.610" end="00:42:06.120" style="s2">unfortunately they have we have not been</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.660" end="00:42:08.690" style="s2">the leader in this particular case and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.120" end="00:42:11.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.690" end="00:42:13.950" style="s2">globally you know there could be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:16.170" style="s2">more cooperation there could be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.950" end="00:42:18.090" style="s2">more of how do we solve this together</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.170" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">and share information and share our</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.090" end="00:42:22.500" style="s2">resources to get to a place where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:23.970" style="s2">all benefiting we&#39;re not there yet maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.500" end="00:42:26.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll get there I my hope is there but</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.970" end="00:42:28.920" style="s2">the we part is really community and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.280" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">global correct yeah absolutely but we</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:33.720" style="s2">have to be very clear it can&#39;t be naive</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:35.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s really crucial and by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.720" end="00:42:37.620" style="s2">think I was just thinking this as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:39.750" style="s2">saying it that you&#39;re in the past I&#39;m do</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.620" end="00:42:41.220" style="s2">under the American hegemony like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.750" end="00:42:44.970" style="s2">quite quite clear after world war two</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.220" end="00:42:47.070" style="s2">under the American hegemony we we led</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.970" end="00:42:48.450" style="s2">and we led for two reasons we led</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.070" end="00:42:50.340" style="s2">because in some sense we were the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.450" end="00:42:52.590" style="s2">position to lead if anybody was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.340" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">lead was gonna be us and if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.590" end="00:42:56.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t leaders can be hard for other</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:58.890" style="s2">people to pull things off we also lived</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.700" end="00:43:00.920" style="s2">because nobody else had in choice you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.890" end="00:43:03.180" style="s2">know what America decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.920" end="00:43:06.360" style="s2">everybody else was more or less going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.180" end="00:43:08.310" style="s2">have to play within that construct and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.360" end="00:43:12.450" style="s2">in many cases I think we tried to lead</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.310" end="00:43:14.520" style="s2">with the with the real intent of for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.450" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">better for the benefit of all not in all</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.520" end="00:43:18.210" style="s2">cases for sure but in many cases you</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:20.990" style="s2">know I think that was the immune the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.210" end="00:43:23.580" style="s2">American Empire</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.990" end="00:43:25.410" style="s2">unfortunately they decided to give the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.580" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">imperial rob was in the in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.410" end="00:43:31.290" style="s2">arc of history a relatively benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:33.540" style="s2">Empire but that ain&#39;t there anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.290" end="00:43:35.190" style="s2">we&#39;re now in a mode of a truly</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.540" end="00:43:37.530" style="s2">multipolar world you know China can</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.190" end="00:43:39.380" style="s2">definitely decide its own fate Europe</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.530" end="00:43:41.460" style="s2">can decide its own thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.380" end="00:43:43.050" style="s2">Russia is sophisticated at deciding</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.460" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">their own fate they can actually punch</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.050" end="00:43:48.150" style="s2">above their grave and America can no</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">longer simply move left everybody has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.150" end="00:43:52.140" style="s2">move left with us that&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:53.340" style="s2">necessarily a bad thing because now it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.140" end="00:43:53.790" style="s2">means that if there is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.340" end="00:43:56.100" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.790" end="00:43:58.050" style="s2">it actually has to be cooperation people</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.100" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">actually have to choose to cooperate on</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.050" end="00:44:05.730" style="s2">the basis of true community you know so</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:09.470" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.730" end="00:44:13.170" style="s2">because no yeah we can&#39;t I can&#39;t help it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.470" end="00:44:16.200" style="s2">governments aren&#39;t good at that and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.170" end="00:44:23.090" style="s2">kinds of people who tend to rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.200" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">top of large bureaucratic institutions</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.090" end="00:44:27.840" style="s2">tend not to be the kinds of people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:29.400" style="s2">are good at that they tend to be the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.840" end="00:44:32.280" style="s2">kinds of people who are good at making</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.400" end="00:44:34.650" style="s2">sure they win fair they win us with us</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.280" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">them games we have some work to do there</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.650" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">right yeah quite rapidly by the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:44.970" style="s2">agreed and so couple things you</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:46.890" style="s2">mentioned right in your article that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.970" end="00:44:49.500" style="s2">wrote yesterday we&#39;re moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.890" end="00:44:51.660" style="s2">what you want to see as maybe what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.500" end="00:44:55.380" style="s2">called a self-organizing collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.660" end="00:44:57.390" style="s2">intelligence write a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.380" end="00:45:00.510" style="s2">that because what you&#39;re really saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.390" end="00:45:03.210" style="s2">is that&#39;s the formula yeah if we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.510" end="00:45:04.590" style="s2">able to put that in place in this weak</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.210" end="00:45:07.170" style="s2">community over a period of time that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.590" end="00:45:10.530" style="s2">that helps us solve for a number of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.170" end="00:45:12.570" style="s2">fragility you know system states that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.530" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">were in currently today yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.570" end="00:45:15.870" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s really too</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:17.340" style="s2">quickly just two dimensions to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.870" end="00:45:18.180" style="s2">not that it&#39;s not actually that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.340" end="00:45:19.890" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.180" end="00:45:22.590" style="s2">so one dimension again is just this</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.890" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">basic notion of community is the notion</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.590" end="00:45:27.120" style="s2">of people choosing to collaborate to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">achieve greater than they could</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.120" end="00:45:30.870" style="s2">individually and in support of something</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:32.970" style="s2">that all of them consider to be mutually</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.870" end="00:45:36.030" style="s2">valuable right that&#39;s we were familiar</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.970" end="00:45:37.050" style="s2">with that thank God and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.030" end="00:45:38.580" style="s2">getting better at that like actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.050" end="00:45:40.980" style="s2">getting better at doing things like okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.580" end="00:45:42.870" style="s2">where can I contribute my value best to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.980" end="00:45:45.750" style="s2">support the larger story and how do I</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.870" end="00:45:47.190" style="s2">discern you know who are the people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.750" end="00:45:48.270" style="s2">I should be supporting and listening to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.190" end="00:45:50.970" style="s2">all that kind of stuff like just getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.270" end="00:45:52.770" style="s2">better at that but then the second is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.970" end="00:45:54.740" style="s2">the the world that we are in at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.770" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">technological level in particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.740" end="00:46:02.820" style="s2">affords such a capacity to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">and to coordinate and to do together</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.820" end="00:46:07.109" style="s2">across at a global scale there just</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:09.900" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.109" end="00:46:12.329" style="s2">present prior to now you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.900" end="00:46:15.269" style="s2">good folks of the 50s and the 60s built</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.329" end="00:46:19.109" style="s2">the world we live in using the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.269" end="00:46:22.140" style="s2">radio television automobiles interstate</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.109" end="00:46:23.609" style="s2">highways were like the big thing during</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.140" end="00:46:25.799" style="s2">the Eisenhower administration and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.609" end="00:46:27.509" style="s2">built that world we&#39;re still largely</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.799" end="00:46:30.180" style="s2">using the institutional structures that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.509" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">were built by and for that world okay it</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.180" end="00:46:37.859" style="s2">is entirely possible like no no question</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:44.809" style="s2">that as we begin to innovate new</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.859" end="00:46:47.819" style="s2">structures of coordination that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.809" end="00:46:50.549" style="s2">appropriate to capabilities of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.819" end="00:46:52.109" style="s2">contemporary environment if those</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.549" end="00:46:55.019" style="s2">structures for coordination will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.109" end="00:46:58.019" style="s2">vastly more effective more capable more</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.019" end="00:47:00.869" style="s2">capacitive less expensive will produce</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.019" end="00:47:02.069" style="s2">less uncertainty and less extra nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.869" end="00:47:04.829" style="s2">less blowback with unintended</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.069" end="00:47:08.609" style="s2">consequences sure can be completely non</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.829" end="00:47:09.690" style="s2">extractive and can actually be the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.609" end="00:47:11.069" style="s2">of things that people enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.690" end="00:47:13.019" style="s2">participating in they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.069" end="00:47:14.759" style="s2">actually sort of subordinate their</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.019" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">personal aspirations to kind of be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.759" end="00:47:20.789" style="s2">good worker yep more to the point</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:23.730" style="s2">they&#39;re the only things that can deal</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.789" end="00:47:27.269" style="s2">with a pace and complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.730" end="00:47:29.190" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re in yeah so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.269" end="00:47:35.420" style="s2">that look like let me just give you like</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.190" end="00:47:38.009" style="s2">a very simple example I&#39;ll do like a two</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.420" end="00:47:41.069" style="s2">topologically ones already happening I</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.009" end="00:47:45.769" style="s2">one is this global mass movement to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.069" end="00:47:49.470" style="s2">able to find curate process and present</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.769" end="00:47:51.809" style="s2">real-time accurate true information</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.470" end="00:47:53.880" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on that people can</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.809" end="00:47:55.650" style="s2">use yeah right and that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.880" end="00:47:58.380" style="s2">right now and it&#39;s happening very well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.650" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">think it is the general under experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.380" end="00:48:04.499" style="s2">that the internet when that is doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:07.019" style="s2">just a flat-out better job than the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.499" end="00:48:10.049" style="s2">official channels at getting information</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.019" end="00:48:11.099" style="s2">to people yeah right and I mean that by</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.049" end="00:48:13.559" style="s2">the way it&#39;s really beautiful about is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.099" end="00:48:16.109" style="s2">they can be quite nuanced so if I just</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.559" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">need to know a few things I can get that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.109" end="00:48:20.310" style="s2">if I need to know very specific things</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:24.030" style="s2">either local to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.310" end="00:48:26.610" style="s2">or local to my area of expertise I get</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.030" end="00:48:27.600" style="s2">that too that&#39;s a very fine-grain thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.610" end="00:48:31.830" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t happen like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.600" end="00:48:34.290" style="s2">watching NBC everybody has to watch this</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.830" end="00:48:36.210" style="s2">same show so there maybe even if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.290" end="00:48:41.580" style="s2">doing their best they&#39;re barely giving</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.210" end="00:48:43.020" style="s2">me anything relevant to me and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.580" end="00:48:44.460" style="s2">frankly they&#39;re very rarely doing their</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.020" end="00:48:47.160" style="s2">best these days okay so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.460" end="00:48:48.560" style="s2">simple one sure and it&#39;s kind of wrote I</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.160" end="00:48:52.860" style="s2">mean we&#39;ve seen this happen you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.560" end="00:48:54.390" style="s2">Craigslist replaced classifieds this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.860" end="00:48:55.980" style="s2">that but just doing that in the domain</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.390" end="00:48:57.450" style="s2">of real time information and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.980" end="00:48:59.460" style="s2">building out by the way building our</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.450" end="00:49:01.740" style="s2">content so right now we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.460" end="00:49:03.780" style="s2">emergence of community groups and these</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.740" end="00:49:05.220" style="s2">community groups all of them are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.780" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">trying to solve with basic same set of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.220" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">problems you know how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:09.060" style="s2">that everybody in the community has</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:10.410" style="s2">enough food and water how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.060" end="00:49:12.600" style="s2">sure we take care of the album how do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.410" end="00:49:13.860" style="s2">take care of kids so that parents can</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.600" end="00:49:15.410" style="s2">actually go do other stuff that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.860" end="00:49:18.870" style="s2">community needs like if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.410" end="00:49:20.340" style="s2">single mom who&#39;s a nurse somebody in</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.870" end="00:49:21.840" style="s2">your community is to go to her and say</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.340" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">we will take care of your kid cuz you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.840" end="00:49:25.320" style="s2">taking care of this community right</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:28.050" style="s2">you know that&#39;s happening Google</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.320" end="00:49:29.640" style="s2">Spreadsheets on that there&#39;s handbooks</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.050" end="00:49:31.800" style="s2">people are writing about the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.640" end="00:49:34.500" style="s2">tech handbook as an example of a real</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.800" end="00:49:36.120" style="s2">good basically where you can get all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.500" end="00:49:38.190" style="s2">information pertinent for many different</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.120" end="00:49:41.790" style="s2">places and figure out how to remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.190" end="00:49:44.940" style="s2">that&#39;s not being produced by the CDC</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.790" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s being hacked together by just</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.940" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">people doing it and as better people</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:51.480" style="s2">come online people are just handing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:52.740" style="s2">off to him say can you do it all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.480" end="00:49:54.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s building building building by</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.740" end="00:49:56.580" style="s2">the way it&#39;s worse type of community</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.180" end="00:49:58.710" style="s2">effort on very delicate areas right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.580" end="00:50:00.120" style="s2">love that so let&#39;s take that now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.710" end="00:50:01.590" style="s2">do the next one the next one is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.120" end="00:50:02.790" style="s2">okay what about hard stuff right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.590" end="00:50:05.970" style="s2">don&#39;t we still need to have you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.790" end="00:50:07.890" style="s2">NASA to go to the moon and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.970" end="00:50:10.050" style="s2">may but it&#39;s not so long but there&#39;s -</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.890" end="00:50:12.870" style="s2">unlike in the tech sector so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.050" end="00:50:14.430" style="s2">biggest challenges that we have and by</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.870" end="00:50:19.110" style="s2">maybe even fact these central challenges</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.430" end="00:50:21.270" style="s2">is detection this thing has a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.110" end="00:50:23.640" style="s2">characteristic of being undetectable or</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.270" end="00:50:26.070" style="s2">asymptomatic for a long time so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.640" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">got you know they walk among you there</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.070" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">are people your teen days yes there</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:34.050" style="s2">there are people who don&#39;t have a clue</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:35.880" style="s2">that they&#39;re sick yes walking around</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.050" end="00:50:38.369" style="s2">creating the possibility of the people</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.880" end="00:50:41.369" style="s2">getting sick yeah that&#39;s more or less</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.369" end="00:50:44.340" style="s2">the whole problem and even if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.369" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">Institute a major quarantine if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.340" end="00:50:48.510" style="s2">detect whether or not there are sick</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:50.340" style="s2">people getting around if the sickness is</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.510" end="00:50:50.580" style="s2">still spreading we don&#39;t know when to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.340" end="00:50:53.220" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.580" end="00:50:54.180" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t if we do stop we would</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.220" end="00:50:55.740" style="s2">know if a second waves come through all</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.180" end="00:50:57.690" style="s2">right so detection is a major problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.740" end="00:50:59.100" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of Americans they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.690" end="00:51:01.260" style="s2">spread out all over the place and our</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.100" end="00:51:03.930" style="s2">current detection technology isn&#39;t up to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.260" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">snuff it&#39;s too slow it&#39;s 70s technology</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.930" end="00:51:08.670" style="s2">like they have to actually ship them</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.060" end="00:51:10.680" style="s2">back to a big lab and batiks process I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.670" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">mean all that crap all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.680" end="00:51:16.320" style="s2">there&#39;s already exists a technology that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">can solve the problem it&#39;s called gene</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.320" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">radar and fortunately that information</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:21.810" style="s2">processing thing brought this to my</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:25.230" style="s2">attention now a bunch of smart people</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.810" end="00:51:26.550" style="s2">know this is the case they talked to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.230" end="00:51:27.960" style="s2">people who were there checked it they</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.550" end="00:51:30.690" style="s2">said oh wow this thing was built to deal</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.960" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">with the Zika virus it can totally be</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.690" end="00:51:34.560" style="s2">repurposed to the coronavirus already</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">has been it&#39;s already an FDA fast track</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.560" end="00:51:41.100" style="s2">trials to solve the problem as we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:42.840" style="s2">yes and it could be scaled yeah to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.100" end="00:51:45.390" style="s2">able to get a device in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.840" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">every hospital in the country and could</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.390" end="00:51:50.310" style="s2">do five million tests a day okay now</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:52.470" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.310" end="00:51:56.280" style="s2">through a couple different paths one</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.470" end="00:51:57.600" style="s2">path might be the White House White</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.280" end="00:51:59.490" style="s2">House might say that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.600" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">solution go make it happen old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.490" end="00:52:05.010" style="s2">government and that&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">right great solution another path might</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.010" end="00:52:10.710" style="s2">be more decentralized right the Mormon</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:11.609" style="s2">Church these guys did worked wonders</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.710" end="00:52:13.859" style="s2">during Katrina</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.609" end="00:52:16.170" style="s2">there are Mormons everywhere they have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.859" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">lot of resources and all of them already</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.170" end="00:52:20.220" style="s2">have food and water taken care of and if</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:22.680" style="s2">I could they have a unusually like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.220" end="00:52:23.340" style="s2">larger than general level of care for</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.680" end="00:52:25.260" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.340" end="00:52:27.510" style="s2">yeah well the Mormon Church could become</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.260" end="00:52:31.380" style="s2">as effective at dealing with this virus</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.510" end="00:52:33.990" style="s2">as the Debbie Joe and the CDC as</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.380" end="00:52:35.430" style="s2">combined because the leverage of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.990" end="00:52:38.070" style="s2">technology can enable that to happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.430" end="00:52:39.570" style="s2">right it wouldn&#39;t actually with for 250</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.070" end="00:52:41.160" style="s2">million dollars and with people being</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.570" end="00:52:42.930" style="s2">able to pull together like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.160" end="00:52:45.600" style="s2">community people working together again</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.930" end="00:52:47.269" style="s2">boom could be done and in fact you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.600" end="00:52:49.039" style="s2">do a frickin Kickstarter</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.269" end="00:52:50.569" style="s2">you could get people signed up all over</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.039" end="00:52:51.709" style="s2">the country to say I will take one when</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.569" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">it&#39;s ready and I will make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.709" end="00:52:55.249" style="s2">we&#39;re ready to start doing testing pull</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:56.869" style="s2">together 250 million dollars get the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.249" end="00:52:59.839" style="s2">supply chain managed appropriately we</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.869" end="00:53:02.119" style="s2">could do a full Apollo 13 project but at</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.839" end="00:53:03.709" style="s2">the community level and any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.119" end="00:53:05.749" style="s2">three paths could be done right now we</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.709" end="00:53:07.909" style="s2">have the capacity to do it the hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.749" end="00:53:09.259" style="s2">science in R&amp;D has been done but we had</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.909" end="00:53:12.829" style="s2">to fight it right it&#39;s an information</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.259" end="00:53:14.419" style="s2">processing and one it&#39;s important in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.829" end="00:53:16.039" style="s2">context of where we are right now but -</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.419" end="00:53:17.630" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also very important to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.039" end="00:53:19.849" style="s2">grasp that this is generally the case</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.630" end="00:53:22.219" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a lot of problems we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.849" end="00:53:25.069" style="s2">solve as a civilization most of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.219" end="00:53:26.959" style="s2">solutions we already have it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.069" end="00:53:28.249" style="s2">really about inventing new things in</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.959" end="00:53:30.109" style="s2">some cases there will be but in most</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.249" end="00:53:31.609" style="s2">cases it&#39;s actually finding the people</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.109" end="00:53:34.309" style="s2">who actually been doing incredible work</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.609" end="00:53:36.529" style="s2">for decades that haven&#39;t been perceived</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.309" end="00:53:39.529" style="s2">and upregulated by our current fragile</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.529" end="00:53:41.089" style="s2">institutions yeah and then resourcing</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.529" end="00:53:43.939" style="s2">them in a context that actually has the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.089" end="00:53:45.949" style="s2">leverage of communitas right that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.939" end="00:53:48.909" style="s2">almost certainly the solution that moves</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.949" end="00:53:51.859" style="s2">us through this thing to the other side</p>
