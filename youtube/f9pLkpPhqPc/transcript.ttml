<p begin="00:00:00.740" end="00:00:06.600" style="s2">okay so I already covered why together</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.290" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">Tec is in my opinion better than</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.600" end="00:00:10.290" style="s2">open-source even though we were course</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:13.139" style="s2">gonna use open source so I&#39;m doing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.290" end="00:00:14.610" style="s2">same now for blockchain so what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.139" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">different than blockchain and better</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.610" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">than blockchain light open-source is</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:21.180" style="s2">because we were gonna use blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">when we need to when it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.180" end="00:00:26.010" style="s2">do so but the pitfalls they have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand it and people</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.010" end="00:00:29.490" style="s2">don&#39;t trust the product that came from</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:31.949" style="s2">it even if it is more trustworthy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">why it&#39;s there when we create it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.949" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">together and therefore there are tools</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">to be able to say I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2">that I needed to understand that and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">enough trust in the whole that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">somewhat pass off our sense making a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">people who do understand it to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">I know that this is being done out in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">the open for all of the tech people to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">see so though my brain doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">comprehend fully what what blockchain is</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">enough people who do are involved and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.579" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">can say I don&#39;t understand that I really</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">want to understand that a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">for blockchain is that although it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">more powerful it still has to compete in</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">with all of the technology that already</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">has all the people and already has the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">trust because it was built up even if</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:17.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a roadie in the trust that erosion</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">of trust is eroding it for them to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.570" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">people within the blockchain space trust</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">it because they understand what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">but the people outside it don&#39;t trust it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">the people who don&#39;t understand what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">is don&#39;t understand why I should trust a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">blockchain more than I would trust</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">Google when I can&#39;t trust Google more</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">than I would trust Facebook when I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">trust Facebook at least there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">something I can I can point to I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">point to Zuckerberg I can point to who</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">owns it and sew them eroding trust</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">erodes it for the rest when as it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">done together and the more we the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">the together is that we do it with and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:57.210" style="s2">for the more powerful it is and the less</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">risky it is and so blockchain does does</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.210" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">amazing stuff but like with a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">group of people it&#39;s not the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">is transparent but how you get and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">you get there&#39;s transparent enough for</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">the techies but it&#39;s not transparent</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">enough for the rest of us it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:12.920" style="s2">we&#39;re like live on YouTube working</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:15.319" style="s2">through what we need to work through</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:17.060" style="s2">so that is available for every member</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.319" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">that comes down the line are they gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:21.380" style="s2">watch it nope but because they could</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.400" end="00:02:23.959" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a trust built there that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.380" end="00:02:25.400" style="s2">we&#39;re not asking people and that like</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.959" end="00:02:27.230" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for tools of what don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.400" end="00:02:29.690" style="s2">you trust and how do you trust it or</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.230" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">whatever the system is we start with it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.690" end="00:02:33.860" style="s2">can always be improved and part of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:35.570" style="s2">they do in the block and all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.860" end="00:02:38.660" style="s2">individual projects and then the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.570" end="00:02:42.709" style="s2">overarching projects like holo chain are</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.660" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">that they have like their protocol right</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.709" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">there following that&#39;s literally what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">they are but you can&#39;t leave Otani on</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:53.959" style="s2">making the protocol better not as a end</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:55.700" style="s2">user right so having it be that like</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.959" end="00:02:58.190" style="s2">there are systems to make it viable for</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.700" end="00:02:59.209" style="s2">non techie people everyday people to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.190" end="00:03:01.550" style="s2">what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.209" end="00:03:04.250" style="s2">and be empowered to make it better</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.550" end="00:03:06.650" style="s2">is why a technology company that we all</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.250" end="00:03:09.290" style="s2">own and operate together is so needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.650" end="00:03:11.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s both more powerful the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:13.070" style="s2">that together is if it&#39;s you know a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.600" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">thousand of us we can create a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.070" end="00:03:17.299" style="s2">thing if weeds million of us we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:18.739" style="s2">create something fits billions of us we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.299" end="00:03:22.340" style="s2">can create a world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.739" end="00:03:23.810" style="s2">everybody and so that isn&#39;t what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.340" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">offer they offer decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.810" end="00:03:26.780" style="s2">because we need it we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:28.220" style="s2">have trust we do people have our</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.780" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">information and have access to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.220" end="00:03:33.049" style="s2">ourselves and be able to know people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">trustworthy we need that piece of it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.049" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">the system of creating it isn&#39;t giving</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">everyday people trust in it how we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">going to create which is democratically</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">transparently and for diversity so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:49.640" style="s2">everything can be improved because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:51.620" style="s2">democracy piece that is broken in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.640" end="00:03:53.720" style="s2">world that you can&#39;t you can&#39;t vote with</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.620" end="00:03:55.310" style="s2">your feet I can&#39;t just leave Canada if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.720" end="00:03:57.110" style="s2">don&#39;t like my Prime Minister you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.310" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">absolutely can leave together attack if</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:03:59.299" style="s2">you don&#39;t like we don&#39;t want you to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:01.579" style="s2">because you&#39;re gonna dissipate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.299" end="00:04:03.769" style="s2">energy so we&#39;re gonna make it work for</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.579" end="00:04:05.510" style="s2">you as much as possible without giving</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.769" end="00:04:10.700" style="s2">up our sovereignty right if you need me</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.510" end="00:04:15.079" style="s2">to go vegan or not go vegan no if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.700" end="00:04:17.539" style="s2">are offering solutions for vegans and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.079" end="00:04:19.640" style="s2">non-vegans and you can be either one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.539" end="00:04:21.200" style="s2">those then why would you leave to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.640" end="00:04:23.660" style="s2">a vegan project you might because really</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.200" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">don&#39;t want like what isn&#39;t working for</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.660" end="00:04:26.599" style="s2">you here and can we make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:27.860" style="s2">and if we can make it work we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.599" end="00:04:28.910" style="s2">make it work because we don&#39;t want them</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.860" end="00:04:31.009" style="s2">to vote with their feet and leave and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.910" end="00:04:33.250" style="s2">dissipate the energy that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.009" end="00:04:35.690" style="s2">diversity is creating for diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.250" end="00:04:37.759" style="s2">transparently is like if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.690" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">transparent enough for you to trust it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.759" end="00:04:41.930" style="s2">what do we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:42.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not installing cameras in my in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:44.509" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:46.490" style="s2">we are meeting live on camera for an</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.509" end="00:04:48.289" style="s2">hour that&#39;s basically the only time we</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.490" end="00:04:49.879" style="s2">communicate there&#39;s a tiny bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.289" end="00:04:51.740" style="s2">communication elsewise it&#39;s like setting</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.879" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">that up like hey read this thing do this</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.740" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">but most of our internet interactions</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:05:00.130" style="s2">are that are like transparently live</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">online so that we can work through</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.130" end="00:05:06.919" style="s2">issues and as issues arise find systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:09.409" style="s2">to deal with them in increasing numbers</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.919" end="00:05:11.060" style="s2">so figuring out what does together look</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.409" end="00:05:12.590" style="s2">like what does creating technology look</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.060" end="00:05:15.130" style="s2">like together and how do we improve that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.590" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">system how do we improve the product and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.130" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">so together tech creating a tech</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:23.240" style="s2">cooperative is powerful and less risky</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:26.509" style="s2">and now that I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.240" end="00:05:28.909" style="s2">that for years my next video is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.509" end="00:05:32.949" style="s2">how we&#39;re actually not a technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.909" end="00:05:32.949" style="s2">cooperative thank you</p>
