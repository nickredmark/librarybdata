<p begin="00:08:17.129" end="00:08:20.729" style="s2">already wondering alright fine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.659" end="00:08:22.979" style="s2">great I agree with you these are all big</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.729" end="00:08:25.169" style="s2">problems what can we do about the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.979" end="00:08:26.729" style="s2">becomes the next question and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.169" end="00:08:29.999" style="s2">the hardest of all of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.729" end="00:08:31.499" style="s2">because the fact is change is not going</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.999" end="00:08:33.089" style="s2">to come from the top down</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.499" end="00:08:35.069" style="s2">that&#39;s your 300 million P and I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.970" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">mean by we embraced a question about</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.970" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">alternative fuel source I&#39;m talking</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.889" end="00:09:51.420" style="s2">what&#39;s different between now and any</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.899" end="00:09:53.610" style="s2">climate history is the internet for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.420" end="00:09:56.610" style="s2">first time ever we have the power to</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:09:58.709" style="s2">community comes up as a solution to a</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.790" end="00:10:07.470" style="s2">can take that solution adapt it refine</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.680" end="00:10:09.990" style="s2">it for their own needs and by sharing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.470" end="00:10:11.910" style="s2">an open-source way by communicating</p>

<p begin="00:10:22.179" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">coming up with our own way to sorting</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.220" end="00:10:28.389" style="s2">and purifying water start coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:30.730" style="s2">our own ways of generating energy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.389" end="00:10:32.980" style="s2">growing food you know get out get our</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.189" end="00:10:45.610" style="s2">in time hopefully this is my dream in</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.259" end="00:11:09.489" style="s2">read a really interesting book recently</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.179" end="00:11:31.629" style="s2">we have to trust that our society or</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.639" end="00:11:56.049" style="s2">I say the centralized power structure</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.009" end="00:11:58.299" style="s2">that currently exists will crumble away</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.049" end="00:12:01.569" style="s2">they will simply fade away into</p>
