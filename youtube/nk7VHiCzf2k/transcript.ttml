<p begin="00:00:29.199" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">the weather is highly variable</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.519" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">and when there&#39;s lots of rapid</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:38.320" style="s2">barometric and humidity change</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">um it really messes up the mirrors in my</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">they&#39;re doable and a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">is not having things perfect but just</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:59.680" style="s2">having them</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">doable so we&#39;re going to proceed now</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.680" end="00:01:04.239" style="s2">as always we&#39;re going to start with uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">some questions from uh patrons</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.239" end="00:01:08.560" style="s2">um and then towards the end we&#39;ll move</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">to questions from the live chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">so the first is from an anonymous patron</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">whoever you are thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.840" style="s2">the question is what are the best</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:20.479" style="s2">practices for character development</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.840" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">um so i think the best practices for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.479" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">character development is to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">as a uh base</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">a as a system of virtues uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">that you identify with and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">and then and then also to see each</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">virtue as a particular way of being wise</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.000" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">um and so we go through these um</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">we can think about how do we cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">uh we cultivate a virtue uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">by thinking about the ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">in which well this model comes from</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">aerosol the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">uh we&#39;re trying to make our uh our</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">behavior as appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">uh to the situation where the situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">all often includes things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">are we regard is inherently valuable</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">because care</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">virtue has to do with our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">to what is true</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">what is good and what is beautiful um so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">using a standard example from</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">aristotle um so my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">one way in which i have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">to the truth and to goodness</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:30.800" style="s2">sometimes even to beauty is my speech</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">and so one of the virtues uh let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.800" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">zero in more on truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">um is you know uh being honest um</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">and so what do i want to do well i i can</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">i can go wrong in two ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">i can uh say too much too often</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">um and that would make me boorish</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">uh it would make me interruptive it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">would uh it would</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">detract from other people&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">speak um</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">it could be unkind it could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">um it could be cruel um so i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to just say everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">that&#39;s you know um but how could i i</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">could also fail to say enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">uh and uh i could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">in that sense i could be you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">of cowardly</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">i could be manipulative by being passive</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">aggressive i could be deceptive by being</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">inadequate uh in the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">information i&#39;m presenting</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">or another example courage i if i face</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">danger too often i&#39;m just an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">if i avoid it always i&#39;m a coward</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">so what you have to do is you cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">and you you cultivate virtues by</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">basically setting up</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">habits that act as what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">virtual engine you set up habits</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">of noticing and counteracting</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">like reducing when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">deviating by being by doing too much by</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">saying too much or facing too much</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">danger and then you also set up habits</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">that motivate you to get you to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">to generate behavior when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">saying enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">or when you&#39;re not facing enough danger</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">and so you build up habits that act of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">what&#39;s called a virtual engine</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">some of them are making you do more when</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing too little</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">and some of you some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">limiting your behavior when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">too much</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">so you you basically cultivate virtues</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">uh cultivating virtual engines but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">of course virtues don&#39;t stand</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">separately from each other right you</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">want to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">virtues in relationship to each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">you need to get good at getting a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">systematic relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">the virtues so like</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">am i when and and this is this is where</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">you know a lot of literature</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">um and parable and myth is very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">because what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">parables often do one of my favorite is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">the parable of the prodigal son</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">is it tells you how our various virtues</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">a non-reducible non-resolvable tension</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">with each other the parrot or the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">prodigal son tells us</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">that compassion and uh and justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">are right if you always do pursue</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">uh that&#39;s not that that&#39;s not good if</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">you always pursue justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">at the expense of compassion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">good they have trade-off relationships</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">so you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">trade-off relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">the virtues so they get to come into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">systematic relationship now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">starting to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">character but there is another degree</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">of systematicity that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">address which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">you&#39;re cultivating that those trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">relationships between the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">also in how they complement your</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">so character is often described as</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">second nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">because you&#39;re taking on all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">habits and then systems of habits</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">right you&#39;re doing all this virtual</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">engineering and then putting the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">in opponent processing of various</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">but you&#39;re doing all of that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">to compensate</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">for your personality where personality</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">um you know and we often talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:19.759" style="s2">big five or the big six</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">like are you more open or you are are</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:26.479" style="s2">and what you have to do is you have to</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">in your personality and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">process of identification</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">what virtues are you identifying with</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">and how do they fit together with your</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">personality but running through all of</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">that what you&#39;re throughout and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">helps you to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">and and create the system of the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">is the idea that ever</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">that virtue as i like to say is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">every virtue is a way of</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">so every virtue requires this</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">the this linking of discerning what</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">discerning through appearances</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">right discerning the relationship</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">and also being sensitive uh being</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">open to what&#39;s disclosing itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">situation so you&#39;re trying to get this</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">harmonic relationship between</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">and disclosure and what you&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">in in every situation in which you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">is you&#39;re trying to like courage i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">trying to see through the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">fear might be distorting and biasing my</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">to see what&#39;s really being disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">here so that i can act most</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">appropriately to this situation</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">so then above and beyond the habits</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">coming into virtues</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">the virtues being systemized into</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">characters into character</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">you are engaging in a comprehensive</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">for the cultivation of wisdom and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked a lot about this both from a</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">uh perspective of the best sort of</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">and also from a practical existential</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">of teaching people uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">ecologies and practices from the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">wisdom traditions buddhism and taoism</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">and also right now from the western</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">um epicureanism stoicism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">neoplatonism we&#39;re about to move into</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:44.399" style="s2">so i think if you have that nested and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">now going from top down wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">into the system of virtues and then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">into you know uh a a virtual engines of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">habit</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">a deep interweaving of personality of</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">and then also of course personality in</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">with personhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">your moral agency then i think that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">goes into answering this about how you</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">but think about the point about the</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">so this is a version of serious play</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">serious play is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">needed in order to set up a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">between yourself and future self because</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">you need</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">your while your current self causes your</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">future self</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">your future self normatively challenges</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">your current self and so they have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">biological relationship each is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">is contributing and so you have to give</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">you have to imaginatively invoke your</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">future self and give voice to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">future self</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">and allow it to talk you ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">you can implement that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">are journaling um you can even have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">future self that&#39;s at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">so when so i know i&#39;m going through my</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">day and i&#39;m trying to note my biases for</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">active open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">i know that my journal waits for me and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">my my journal is almost like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">this future self that&#39;s going to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">back on what&#39;s happening right now and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">that&#39;s how they&#39;re talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">you can actually do it directly through</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.320" style="s2">imagination you can do it through syria</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">play practices</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.320" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">there are versions of active role</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">uh that allow you to get into this</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:43.680" style="s2">of course if you belong to a religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">tradition there are religious traditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.680" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">uh that allow this kind of practice uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">to occur when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to your soul or to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">character or to your better self</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s also practices that you do</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">now um</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">that have to do with trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">right here right now you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">even some therapies like dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">behavioral therapy where you try to give</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">voice to your wise self</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">because your wise self is the self that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">is often</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">trying to speak on behalf of your future</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">self because</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">aspiration is ultimately a process of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">what&#39;s called proleptic</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">rationality aspiration requires is bound</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">up enmeshed with</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">wisdom cultivation so you try and sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">your wise self</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">so i mean part of that is with your</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">journaling you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">try to note the ways throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">in which you were virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">this is also called watering your buddha</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">in the buddhist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">you try and right it&#39;s one of the three</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">jewels the buddha the dharma the sangha</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">you try to remember throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:48.560" style="s2">when you were more like the buddha or</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">you&#39;re more like christ or you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.560" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">like socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">and you celebrate it and you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">identify with it you</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">you invoke it and you you you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">affirm that you want that to grow within</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">you to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">to to to become uh more prevalent within</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">and then what you can do is also and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">this was a technique</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">uh that has been it&#39;s a perennial</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">technique it goes back to the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">jordan peterson has more recently</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">revived it</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">you do reverse journaling you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">write a reverse narrative you write</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">about your future</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">potential future selves and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">write the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">like it&#39;s like you&#39;re reverse</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">engineering it okay here&#39;s john and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">things have gone really horrible how did</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">he get there and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">write a reverse narrative and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">john and things have gone very well in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">reverse narrative</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">and then you use that for discernment</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">and disclosure so you know how to move</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">um so all of these when you practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">them at least i</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">found um they all mutually reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">they just naturally start to glum onto</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">and mutually afford and reinforce each</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">other and so if you integrate what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">just said with my previous answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">about the cultivation of character i</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">think that&#39;s a way of answering your</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">at least i hope it&#39;s helpful i&#39;m here uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">the next question is from</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">rachel hayden who&#39;s also a patron</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">hello john thank you so much for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">book list advice last month you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">welcome rachel</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">rachel uh so far i&#39;ve really enjoyed on</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2"> in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">as you should it is rightly considered a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">masterpiece uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">and for those of you who are unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">it it&#39;s the classic work by harry frank</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">distinguishing bullshitting i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">trying to be of all gear this is a term</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s being used technically</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:36.480" style="s2">bullshitting from lying</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">so basically the idea is the liar</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.480" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">manipulates you by because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">you care about the truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">and telling you pretending that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">is true the artist tries to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">manipulate you by getting you to not</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">whether or not something is true or not</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">and just be caught up in how salient</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">it is um some people have</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">uh i just want to slow down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">um the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">we are often self-deceptive this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">socratic idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">when we find things salient beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">of them we so we&#39;re not really we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">our concern for the truth or the at</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">least the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">of what we&#39;re after is not calibrated</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">is not coordinated with how salient and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">motivating something is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">so you can often ask people why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">doing this well i really want this</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">um and then you ask them well do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">actually understand the phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">you want do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">what it entails like well i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">happy okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">what&#39;s happiness what well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">pursuing it so deeply what</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">is it what is it how do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">it very well</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">so the idea is we can often</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">the where the salience of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">is so radically disconnected uh from our</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">understanding now some people say</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">but sometimes like especially in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">or other situations</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">the salience is there way before the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">understanding that&#39;s why i&#39;m in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s a very good point but</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">that&#39;s to that&#39;s that means you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">fully picked up on</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">that intention defies action what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">difference between a wink and a blink</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">it&#39;s the intention behind the action</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">you&#39;re in a situation in which somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">is making something salient</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">at the expense of understanding its</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want you to question</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">them anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t want you to reflect and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">explore that&#39;s bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">when the salience exceeds our</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">understanding and that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">motivating us to increase our</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">understanding to ask questions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">explore like we do in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">that of course is wonder and socrates</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">famously said that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">uh wisdom begins in wonder so if once we</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">those two together we can understand we</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">have these two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">to bullshitting which is the right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">separation of salience from</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">understanding or for</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">caring about the truth and that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">and that is directly framed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">try and shut down</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">questioning shut down wondering shut</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">down reflection</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">shut down the attempt to to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">okay so all of that is now i think a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">good enough background</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">so i want to now go on with rachel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">as a uf citizen oh boy i&#39;m a canadian</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">and like the rest of the world we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">watching what&#39;s happening in the united</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">states with</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">um an increasing mixture of concern</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">and fascination and fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">um especially for canadians because</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:52.880" style="s2">you know we share this long border and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">we&#39;re a very small country</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">uh population wise compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">united states and militarily</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very concerning thing so i</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">understand your situation i have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">in the united states rachel and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">anxiety that they&#39;re expressing um is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">really significant</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">so as a u.s citizen how does one work at</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">the meta-political level while not</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">abdicating responsibility at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">political level</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">so i&#39;ll i&#39;ll finish up the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">question a sec</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">the distinction uh the political level</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">is the political level</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">uh is where you identify for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">particular position</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">uh which advocates a set of policies</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">that are supposed to bring about a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">particular goal</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the political level um</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">the metapolitical level</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">is uh working at the level of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">are the cultural cognitive processes</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">that are presupposed by that previous</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">what what do we need to do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">a system that is self-correcting so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">we can select the correct policies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">the correct goals and the correct ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">of implementing the policies</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">so in particular i&#39;m very concerned and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve had some discussions with zach</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">stein about this um also with brent</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">cooper</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">about uh that the metapolitical level</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">uh very significantly degraded the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">uh we that we have lost the commitment</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">uh to the idea that we are largely</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">and we need people who are opposing us</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">in order to give us the opponent</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">processing that is self-corrective</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">like you find in all biological systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">instead we have turned that into</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">adversarial processing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">in which the chances that i&#39;m wrong are</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">minimal</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;m right i&#39;m self-righteously right</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:41.280" style="s2">both sides say this</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">um the left to say i&#39;m self-righteously</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.280" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">right in getting you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">and pointing out you know how much human</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">beings are subject to fate</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">and the and the right says i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">self-righteously right and telling you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">how much we should hold human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">individually responsible for their</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">and of course like the prodigal son and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">then like justice and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">they&#39;re both right and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">wrong and at different times and at</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">different degrees</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">and we need them to cooperate at not at</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">the political level</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">at the metapolitical level of being</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">committed</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">to the process over their position so</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">everybody everybody benefits from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">so the problem is how do you work at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">how do you those two levels right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">especially united states are like</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a dichotomy or even an</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">antagonism between them</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">because people are so identified</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">self righteously with their position</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">and an adversarial processing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">the the fact that we should be</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">pressing political issues</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">but with the metacrisis unfolding so</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">rapidly it also</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">almost seems counterproductive to spend</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">so much energy on as you say increasing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">unhelpful left-right debates</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">yes and so the connection i take it that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">rachel&#39;s making is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">with adversarial processing with winner</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">all zero-sum gain and the other side</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">is distrustful and evil uh the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">you see the dialogue moving more and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">more towards bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">on on all on all sides um</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">look at work at sloman and you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">people and they come into these</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">situations and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">so opposed to each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">you get them to talk about their values</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">in the position it just exacerbates it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">but let&#39;s say that that uh let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">it&#39;s about health care</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">what a big issue in the united states if</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">you if you if you shift and say well</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">before we get to the positions and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">can you guys both explain what what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">health care</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">how it functions how it actually works</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">why it&#39;s breaking down and why it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">fun like what&#39;s the actual machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">what happens is and this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">called the knowledge illusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">this is a way in which we systematically</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2"> ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">we confuse the salience of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">access to information with the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">you can see this in even very mundane</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.919" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">things do you know how a bicycle works</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">sure sure i understand bicycle draw a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">bicycle draw bicycle a diagram</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">that will actually explain to me how it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">works most people can&#39;t do it do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">know how the toilet works oh yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">sure well draw a diagram show me how</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">does it work</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">um oh i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">so we we suffer from the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">illusion and notice this weird feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">loop the knowledge illusion</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">makes us ourselves and focus</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">on our values and our positions which</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">then exacerbate the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">illusion and make the adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">processing worse but in the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">when you ask people to explain the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">of the phenomena over which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">if they&#39;re honest and people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">always honest but if people are just</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">dishonest</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">there&#39;s not a lot we can do but if</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">they&#39;re honest and in the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">what happens is you see them converging</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">towards each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">they start genuine dialogue because</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">the realization of their shared</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">ignorance causes the realization of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">shared humility</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">and the shared need for wondering and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:09.679" style="s2">for becoming</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">wiser for getting a coordination between</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.679" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">discernment and disclosure going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you can do it so i would</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">recommend to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">that what what you can do is you can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">this within these situations</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">you can try and get people that are left</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">right to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">right still do deal with a political</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">issue and then okay we need to solve</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">this problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">but instead of values in the position</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">let&#39;s work on getting a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">of what the phenomenon actually is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">for you personally um rachel</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m the best person to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">ask for this advice</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s a general uh and i mean a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">piece of advice that i just gave you i</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:59.159" style="s2">hope you find that helpful</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">but personally uh this is um i&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.159" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">increasingly frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">uh and and i see friends and family</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">being being bludgeoned into silence</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">from both the left and the right up</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">both the left and the right um</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">undermining</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">science and doing engaging in</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">that it supports their particular i</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">political ideology</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">um and when that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">um it it&#39;s hard to be virtuously allied</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">uh with either the left or the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">um and it&#39;s happening um</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">i i consider myself uh quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">quite left for uh for most of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">my my history but i increasingly think</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">irrelevant uh because the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">right to my mind are now</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">undermining right are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">undermining through the tsunami of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">uh the metapolitical level um this</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">uh the uh science and history</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">um and and those three are so</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">interconnected together by the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">they all mutually depend on each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">uh that it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">so i suppose my response</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">there then and what i&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">defaulted to is while working as much as</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">i can</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">to get people to converge and to also</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:35.279" style="s2">a a re-identification with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">metapolitical level and a recommitment</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.279" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">at the political level i recommend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">people um</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">trying to find people uh at this third</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">and this isn&#39;t a trivial thing about to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">say but i generally are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">people who just</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">who display uh virtue and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">and that for me takes priority so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">in canada i&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">um the canadian governments</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">handle the covet crisis and this is just</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">an objective fact just look</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">at the numbers okay i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">argue with anything about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">we&#39;re handling the covet crisis way</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">better the united states</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">and i&#39;ve seen this uh that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">a quite leftist liberal government</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">a de facto coalition between a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">gov a liberal government</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">and a socialist party or socialist</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;s working with</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">a right center municipal government and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">everybody acted pragmatically and</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">and they practice listening to the</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">and then pain being sensitive to what</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">and so all three of these levels have my</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">because they&#39;re saving lives</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">and making them subservient to the</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">because literally hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">of people are dying</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">and then literally millions of lives are</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">being disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">and destroyed and covid is making the</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">teaching compared to in-person teaching</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">perhaps at the high school college age</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">level what is gain</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like a spring day here which of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.880" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">course is going to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">everybody uh everybody&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">circadian rhythms and stuff like that</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">do it the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">rob because i was surprised about what</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed what by what&#39;s gained by</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">the online teaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">uh so what i use in my online teaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">is i used a a flipped classroom model</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">what that means is i record so i record</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">asynchronously and they&#39;re put online</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">and the students can watch them whenever</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">they want to and that helps to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s nice because it</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">bridges between</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">you know having live action speech and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">having you know written text</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:09.919" style="s2">they can watch it at different times</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">they can re-watch it uh they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.919" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">bound by</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">time zones and then what i have is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">time in the week that would normally be</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">dedicated to the lecture</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">i have what i call town halls and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">what i do is i break that time up let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">say it&#39;s a three hour block</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">into half hour increments and then i</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">break the class up into small</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">cohorts of around 10 people or so or if</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a larger class</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">you know more but still much smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">then what people come in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">on zoom in in the zoom room and we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">open discussion which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re coming they&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">the lecture and they&#39;re instructed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">come in with</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">making connections comments</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">criticisms asking for clarifications</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">bringing up topics for discussion</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">and what this me what this has me what</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:58.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve do what i&#39;ve gained</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">is two things i get to have more</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">interaction with my students and i get</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">to know them more personally which helps</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">tailor my education to them and tailor</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">feedback to them and also what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">enhanced is student-to-student</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">interaction students are much more</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:16.640" style="s2">likely to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">and also feel supported which was odd</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.640" end="00:33:20.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s a virtual environment so</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">that was definitely gained</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.080" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">what was lost and this is strange</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">what&#39;s lost in this is really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s something i&#39;m struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">figure out how to do and i&#39;m struggling</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">to figure out because i&#39;m not only a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">teacher i&#39;m the director of the cogside</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">at the university of toronto what&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">is the hallway experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">we can capture right now pretty good i</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">think i just described it</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">what what was going on in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">but what we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">right is the hallway experience which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">especially important at college level</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">right but also to some degree at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">high school level</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">this is when people are outside the</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">the foyer experience we&#39;re doing the</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">but we&#39;re not actually you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">and talking to each other and doing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">weird blending</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">of fixing the personal and the</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">and right between you know sociality</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">and epistemology and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">is so vital so</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">deeply vital it&#39;s like the hallways are</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">the arteries and the veins along which</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">you know education flows and the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">rooms are the organs</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">and those organs are now starved for the</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">that makes them so vital vitally alive</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">and so what&#39;s been lost is the hallway</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">but trying a lot of things and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">technology is</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it allows me to do some of that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">some of it a bit here and there but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">technology&#39;s not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">having what i would want is a technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:15.599" style="s2">implemented the hall rooms and the</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.599" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">in between the classes um and of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of this going on with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">discord server</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">but then the coordination there isn&#39;t an</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">technology yet between them um and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">like with ammar&#39;s amazing techno mage</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">um and it depends on his particular</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">uh to be uh functional but</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">i what i would really like is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">technology that made that really smooth</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">and very userly user intuitive friendly</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">because i&#39;m something of a techno</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">peasant when it comes to that level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">and then i would like and this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">the conversations i&#39;ve had with jordan</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">hall and with zach stein</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">i would like a the development</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">of the classrooms so i hope that answers</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">well it&#39;s a really good question and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">really important</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">next question uh this is from an</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">and i want to thank you for your support</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">um how do i forgive myself for my</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a question uh that i deeply</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">identify with</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">um some degree i think because of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">personality i&#39;m socially phobic by</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">uh quite introverted</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">and then also because of my upbringing i</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">was brought up in a very punitive form</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">of fundamentalist christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">um i i have internalized um</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">a very sadistic superego as my very good</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:12.560" style="s2">leo ferraro designates it um</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">and so this is a question that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.560" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">wrestled with very significantly</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">um it it it um it</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">it it puts pressure it tends to fragment</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">or at least threat uh you know sheer</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">make threadbare uh the fabric the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">tapestry</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">of my sense of self because uh when i</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">look back at my previous self</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">it it i tend to i tend to want to pull</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">uh because of uh the foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">and the vice that i see in my past self</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">and i mean and this is not i hope it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">i mean it doesn&#39;t i&#39;m doing it right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">uh i i hope this is this is genuine and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">not just false modesty</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">right or egocentrism so i pull away and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">that takes the fragment um</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s one well that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">reasons why uh the the the prospect of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">personal immortality i find horrific</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">uh because that fraying um</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">strikes me as would just be inseparable</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">cleavage and destruction given enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">so i&#39;m sorry that was a long preamble to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">tell you how seriously i take this</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">so i have found uh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">there&#39;s practices from the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">tradition and the western traditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">that help me to deal with that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">what they do is they help me to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.839" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">replace punitive guilt</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">with two things replace punitive guilt</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">with moral guilt</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">and replace punishment part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s part of punitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:01.599" style="s2">guilt with what&#39;s called intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">regret</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.599" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">so uh punitive psychological guilt is</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">hurting yourself psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">you are paining yourself as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">trying to modify your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">now all behavior modification starts</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.680" style="s2">there pedagogically</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.359" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">but that the mistake is to end there if</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.680" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">you were to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">like if you were to just use punishment</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">on a dog</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">all the time you&#39;re going to turn it</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">into a monster</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">right in fact you want to you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">as little this is what all the research</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">shows even with your kids</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">right so think about it with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">you want to use as little punishment</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">that is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">for bringing about compliance often we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">we have trained ourselves sadistic super</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">ego</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">to over punish way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">what is needed for modifying our</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">so we have to let that go we have to let</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">that go so what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">well what we do is we first try to put</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">aside</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">psychological guilt and look at moral</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">guilt part of what i do in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">journaling is every day</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">i get into the habit</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">habit tends to reduce the overdramatic</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">nature that our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">always brings with us part of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">consciousness does is it just</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">turns up the drama on everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">so you get into the habit of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">acknowledging you know writing when</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">when what was a what was a vice that i</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">committed today</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">i was dishonest uh a vice of commission</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">you know i was dishonest what what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">uh what was a vice of omission i could</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">have been more empathetic there</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">but you get it into the habit of doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">it now what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">all of the super affect starts to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">away because you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">interested in the virtue of this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">more interested in cultivating the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">virtue i also look for my bias</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">my particular like about so you know i</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">caught myself today oh the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">bias there it is again</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">that&#39;s literally happened right and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">you you you get this middle place</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">between ah</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">and ignoring it because you&#39;re noting it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">down you&#39;re writing it down in the third</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">and then i do the fourth thing i also</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">try to notice</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">a virtue a way in which again my inner</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">buddha expressed itself or my inner</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">came to life and i don&#39;t get all i do</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t do that from like oh look how</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">great i am i try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">you know hold against narcissism but</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">right because if you are genuinely being</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">attracted to the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">eventually you&#39;ll get softer sun you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">get that meta virtue you&#39;ll you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">you won&#39;t have to resist the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">to the vice</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">because you&#39;ve gotten into the habit of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">finding the virtue so salient</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">just like as an adult you don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">your children&#39;s toys or children</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">so tempting anymore you can get to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">place where you&#39;re more and more tempted</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">to the good</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">and then that goes along with replacing</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">punishment</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:00.839" style="s2">with intelligent regret you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.839" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">where like if your friend has done</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">wrong you talk to them as a friend you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">don&#39;t punish them</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t make them feeling really bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">you might do that a little tiny bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">minimal force to get compliance to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">people to listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">and to take seriously and to commit to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:23.040" style="s2">behavioral change that&#39;s what compliance</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:25.839" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">compliance doesn&#39;t mean subservience so</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.839" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">minimal force</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">but what mostly do you when you persuade</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">you persuade them you say well look</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and look at how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">getting trapped and look at how this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">self-deceptive and self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">and you also inspire them to aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">look this is what i really</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">love about you you have this like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">try and train them in softer sun</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">in turning their eyes so they&#39;re tempted</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">to the good well do that to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">befriend yourself with intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">regret</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">replace psychological</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">guilt with moral guilt by getting into</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">the habit</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">of reflecting on your vices and your</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">so that it&#39;s not just this overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">affective place because those habits</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">will actually modify your behavior much</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">better than all this punitive affect</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">especially if those habits are conjoined</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:23.920" style="s2">to intelligent regret</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.839" style="s2">which appeals to you as an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">potentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.839" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">rational adult</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">rather than as a pre-linguistic</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">this this sounds like a hallmark card</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">from cognitive science but</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:22.319" style="s2">consciousness never ceases to astonish</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">me it&#39;s it&#39;s that kind of phenomena</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">um what&#39;s astonishing me about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">consciousness is</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">i mean but i&#39;m trying to separate my</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s bound up with the answer i just</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">gave like</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">consciousness it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve tended i i want to be very</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">respectful of my colleagues because</p>

<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">right but we&#39;ve tended to play make</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">this separate weird thing and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">know what it does or how it emerges</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s one way that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">capturing</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">um how sort of unique a phenomena it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">and some people then tie sort of they</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">hang</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">they treat it as a spiritual skyhook in</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">which they try and hang</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">various very questionable metaphysics um</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:50.359" style="s2">but the opposite is happening to me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">seeing how</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">on the called the elusive self on the</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">so how interwoven consciousness is with</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:11.119" style="s2">um intelligence and the self</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">and agency and biology</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.119" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:18.240" style="s2">like so it&#39;s the op it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">opposite of it&#39;s this weird thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:21.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">consciousness is kind of for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.119" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">ontological super glue right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">um and it glues to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">it it contributes to the processes by</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">which the self is glued together</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">uh the agent is glued to the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">the different kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">especially protect bacterial and</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">are are glued together um</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">the way our intelligence and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">is is glued to you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">aspects of uh the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">our personalities</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">connect us to the world you know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">know intelligence is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">relevance realization within people</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">personality is basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">a way in which evolution has distributed</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">relevance realization across people</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">because we have these various different</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">degrees of openness</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">and conscientiousness and stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">actually get this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">um capacity to realize</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">relevance in distributed cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:23.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">all all consciousness is gluing all</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.359" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">those together and it&#39;s moving us all</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">uh and and it&#39;s it is tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">self-transformative capacity like in</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">mystical experience or in</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">uh when you get when you get when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">in deal when you&#39;re in the uh like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">practicing dial dialectic and the deal</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">logos and you get that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">that third factor the sense of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">the we space emerging</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">and that weird that weird and wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">consciousness associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">so for me what&#39;s astonishing right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">is the power and breadth and depth of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">the super glue of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">so here&#39;s another question uh from uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">jackson lipford who&#39;s also a patron</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">how does one dream and set goals for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">future allah reverse narratives without</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">inviting self-deception and bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">um so the the the thing is uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">and this has been one of my concern</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.319" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know if peterson</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">does this</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">i i i&#39;ve i haven&#39;t seen it i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">been privy enough to the inside of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">how it works so</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t i&#39;m not criticizing that but i</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">have seen people</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">implementing this uh the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">narratives falling prey to what</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:39.359" style="s2">jackson is exactly saying self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.359" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">and and and then the answer there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">right um well do a lot to really</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">undermine the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">of uh by getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">in which you&#39;re constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:57.839" style="s2">deeply reintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">what you find salient with what you find</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.839" end="00:50:02.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">important uh sorry what that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.160" end="00:50:05.440" style="s2">that was the equivalent way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">putting it integrating what you find</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.440" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">salient with your</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">your attempts to understand as deeply</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">what you take to be true or most real um</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">and so you have to be you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">nothing in the practice i would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">of reverse narratives that&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">this job i think you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">uh an ecology of practices that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">cultivating wisdom and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:31.839" style="s2">and you have to pay much more attention</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">much more attention</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.839" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">to how the world and other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">are telling you you are transforming</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">than from your own first-person</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">because of course we overestimate how</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">well we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">we over interpret our experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">because of narcissistic narrative bias</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">um and we right and we often because of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">introspection</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">we pay attention to the wrong things</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">because introspection is a very flawed</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">uh mechanism very flawed process</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:03.040" style="s2">so pay much more attention to how people</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">are reporting to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">um your your transformative trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:11.119" style="s2">then your own sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:11.119" style="s2">you know have them talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">and so i think if you do that if you pay</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">to the people that you honor</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:21.280" style="s2">the people that you think what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">that the people that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.280" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">you feel are deserving of respect uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">because they have given you good reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">to believe</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">in their character believe in their</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">and their wisdom and their</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">care for you and then listen to them</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">navigate the world</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve been critical of sam harris at</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">points within the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">sometimes perhaps a little bit harsh</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">because i find</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">at times his stance is very strident um</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">and maybe i over compensated</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">and sometimes also in voices with raviki</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m generally critical of the new</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">atheists because i simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">as many of you know criticized both</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">and i think both theists and atheists</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">shared set of presuppositions that i</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">think should be seriously questioned</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">uh i&#39;m also working on a video series uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">for that which will come out after</p>

<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">this is not a criticism that i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">just me other people have noted uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">people who have</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">have at one time been quite staunch</p>
