<p begin="00:00:02.960" end="00:00:05.920" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.520" end="00:00:07.440" style="s2">at earth regenerators i thought it might</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.920" end="00:00:09.440" style="s2">be nice to give you a brief</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.440" end="00:00:11.679" style="s2">video update because it&#39;s just more</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.440" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">friendly to let you know some of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.679" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">going on here</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">they&#39;re really two sets of activities</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:23.680" style="s2">changing how earth regenerators works</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">that are both exciting and invigorating</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.680" end="00:00:26.960" style="s2">but also</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">can be a little confusing one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.960" end="00:00:29.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:31.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve just started a community</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">regenerators</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.039" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">training program or a mutual learning</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:36.399" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.600" style="s2">where almost 40 members of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.399" end="00:00:41.600" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.600" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">have joined uh joined diego galli</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.600" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">and me on a journey of discovery to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:48.640" style="s2">how can we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:50.480" style="s2">form a decentralized leadership team</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.640" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">and develop new capacities for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.480" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">network and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">started last week and we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:58.239" style="s2">exploring the framework of pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">and how to create effective groups</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.239" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">and a lot of our work will focus on how</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">to design</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">tools and frameworks for better</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">collaboration across this platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">to serve all of the projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">more than 2 000 members</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">around the world are trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">progress on</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">and make impacts in their local</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">so we have some really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">conversations that have just</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">started and we will give you updates as</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">to let you know what we&#39;re learning and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to accomplish and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">service to all of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">so that&#39;ll be coming soon the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">thing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">is here in barichara in colombia where</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">my family lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">we have begun the process of forming a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">and this grew out of several years of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">thinking of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not a completely you know new idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">but a few weeks ago we visited a piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">of heavily degraded land</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">that is in a strategic area related to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">the system of aquifers</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">the place that brings all of the water</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">to the village of bodhichara</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">and also to the nearby village of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">villanueva</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">and this degraded land was something</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">that was so inspiring to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">how badly damaged it is and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">uh for sale and is at a reasonable price</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">and i posted on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2">commenting about wanting to liberate</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">this land to my surprise</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">people started offering to donate money</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve now raised some money</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:30.800" style="s2">through these gifts</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">to be able to start talking with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.800" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">current owners</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">and try to negotiate a price to buy this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">land and set up a land trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">and this really compelled us to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">action and start</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">formally setting up this foundation to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">talk with</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">lawyers who understand how land trusts</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">work in this region</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re now developing a framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">that has several</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">models of cooperation that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">experimentally explore</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">and set up a research program to study</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">as we attempt</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">bioregional regeneration here in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">part of the northern andes</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">and we have four models of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to play with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">you know in combinations you could think</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">of them as elements to mix together</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">in different contexts and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">these four ways that we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">using this initial piece of land and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">foundation that we&#39;re setting up</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">to really take a lot of what we talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">about on this platform</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">and put it into practice now the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">framework of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">is the design school the design</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">institute for regenerating earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking about here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">some of our webinars and in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">writings</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">in the study group that we want to set</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">a design school where people can come</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">and join real world projects study</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">bioregional design</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">and practice regenerative design</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">within some of the projects that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">participating in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">including this piece of land that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">going to start negotiating the purchase</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">to set up a land trust and begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:04.720" style="s2">reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">so this model of cooperation is for</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.720" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">students and for teachers and trainers</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">from around the world to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">gather around local projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">and help create new ways of creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">and creating community development</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">in service to landscape regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">the second framework that we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">at is something</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">like a buyer&#39;s club so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">familiar with traditional cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">a really proven and effective model is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">if a group of families come together and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">buy things in bulk</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">like maybe 10 families come together and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">buy you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">100 pounds of rice and then they share</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">it between each other and they get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">better price</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">because they&#39;re buying in bulk so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">form of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">is very well established and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">thinking about is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">to take this model and apply it to land</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">that there are people who want to buy</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">land in the region</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">and what we&#39;d like to be able to do is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">coordinate and bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">so that they can either buy land that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">then is put into service of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">or that they can join and collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">with some of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">projects or other private landowner</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">in the region as we&#39;re coordinating with</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">them so this is a way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">leveraging the power of collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">purchasing and collective agreements to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">create larger scale impacts in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">region so we&#39;ll be experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">this locally</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">now a third way that we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">about creating cooperation because we</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">have four models</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">the third way that we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">look at forming a network of forest</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">reserves</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">and we actually have some collaborators</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">that are building a network of forest</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">reserves</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">within the green belt that surrounds</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">body chara right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">so we&#39;re using their model as a form of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">that we&#39;d like to work with and extend</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:57.199" style="s2">here the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">is that we will partner with private</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">landowners and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">help them create zoning where they might</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">identify a section of their land</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">and that they want to set aside for</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">native forest and then we can help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">to set up</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">the legal frameworks of protection as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">nature reserve</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">which gives them tax-exempt status but</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">restricts their ability to develop on</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">the land this might even lead in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">cases</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.280" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">to the landowners donating some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">land to the foundation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">setting up</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">so that we can form a patchwork quilt of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">forest reserves</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">spread across the landscape now also we</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">have a fourth model that our</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">family personally is very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">which is the model of creating</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">community food forests where we identify</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">pieces of land</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">and we&#39;re already working with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">moncora bio parque which is a six and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">half hectare</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">community forest right on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">bodhichara so it&#39;s a model for us to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">think with</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">but here the idea is to invite</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">a group of families or students part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">the design school</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">to come together on a larger piece of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">land and start to build</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">a food forest where they would engage in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">agroforestry practices to do things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">grow the plants that make natural fibers</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">for clothing and baskets</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">as well as construction materials for</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">natural building</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">for medicinal plants and for food so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">building a native forest for this region</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">that has all of this knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">skills built into it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">and here the idea would be to think of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">these food forests as being like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">learning school</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">embedded in the landscape with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">possibility that one or more families</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">might engage in intentional living on</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.759" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">or students might come and train in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">working on these reforestation projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">where families may also be living</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">so the idea is that the community food</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">forest becomes the model of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">for the people involved in it so these</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">are the four models that we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">about right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">and i want to share them with you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">show that as we&#39;re developing our</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">capacities to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">on the platform in a decentralized and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">geographically spread</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">way all around the planet that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">still very devoted</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">to creating models of bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">that seek to create regenerative local</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">economies</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">and that we&#39;re really prototyping this</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">very actively here in northern columbia</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">with the goal to have this become one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">the learning centers</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">that becomes part of a global network</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">that grows out of these efforts</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">or that connects with existing efforts</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">that are deeply aligned</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">so i just wanted to give you this little</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">update that these are two of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">and this is why we have fewer live</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">sessions right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;ve reduced the number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">webinars from two</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">per month down to one per month and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit less activity</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">visually happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">on the platform because we&#39;re very busy</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">with these two focus areas</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">but i wanted to just give you this</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">update and let you know more of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">because we&#39;re still working very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">develop upon</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">all that we&#39;ve built so far this year so</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">thank you for being here and being</p>
