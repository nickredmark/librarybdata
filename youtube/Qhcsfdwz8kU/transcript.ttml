<p begin="00:00:30.289" end="00:00:36.880" style="s2">come up with a grand narrative or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.890" end="00:00:41.840" style="s2">screwed if I understand correctly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.880" end="00:00:44.930" style="s2">that perhaps the key to this perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.840" end="00:00:48.110" style="s2">key to saving ourselves in this very</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.930" end="00:00:51.470" style="s2">dangerous period has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.110" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">with shamanism right yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.470" end="00:00:55.430" style="s2">shameless shameless are usually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:57.020" style="s2">useless and they&#39;re sort of stuck out in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.430" end="00:00:58.730" style="s2">the forest and they&#39;re cooking there</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.020" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">which is Bruce and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.730" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">but at times or evolutionary change when</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:06.920" style="s2">you go through a proper paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:08.420" style="s2">actually historically the shamanic cast</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.920" end="00:01:10.100" style="s2">the four or five percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.420" end="00:01:14.300" style="s2">population belong to the shamanic eyes</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.100" end="00:01:16.460" style="s2">are absolutely key made the connectors</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.300" end="00:01:18.920" style="s2">when that happens so your theory is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.460" end="00:01:21.740" style="s2">the shamanic a still exists perhaps led</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.920" end="00:01:25.070" style="s2">but less than not in a formal sense or</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.740" end="00:01:26.750" style="s2">it has to be created or I think if</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.070" end="00:01:28.700" style="s2">anything doesn&#39;t have to be formal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.750" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">a shamanic cast the least organized</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.700" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">people you ever find but when they</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:37.460" style="s2">create institutions to do so to back up</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:40.430" style="s2">and support truth and truth seeking so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.460" end="00:01:42.100" style="s2">so yeah churches for example or priests</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.430" end="00:01:44.869" style="s2">to it before they go corrupt at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.100" end="00:01:47.720" style="s2">their shamanic cast diplomats are so</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.869" end="00:01:49.640" style="s2">many casts medicine and of all kinds um</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.720" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">but also you know the outcasts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.640" end="00:01:55.940" style="s2">society the the brothel Madam&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:57.470" style="s2">horse and the executioner&#39;s all those</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.940" end="00:01:58.909" style="s2">guys belong to the shamanic ass they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.470" end="00:02:00.950" style="s2">about four to five percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.909" end="00:02:03.380" style="s2">population in any general population you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.950" end="00:02:05.659" style="s2">can measure their personality traits and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.380" end="00:02:07.340" style="s2">one of the most interesting aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.659" end="00:02:10.729" style="s2">each manic is that you don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.340" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">strangers you don&#39;t understand why the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.729" end="00:02:14.630" style="s2">rest of humanity is obsessed with their</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.560" end="00:02:17.490" style="s2">sex lives because he just</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.630" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">fuck anything that moves no problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.490" end="00:02:21.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand what the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:23.819" style="s2">man is obsessed with skin color because</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.720" end="00:02:25.350" style="s2">just like why would you care what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.819" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">getting called yet it&#39;s just skin color</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.350" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">okay this is typically shamanic traits</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">um which also means that the shaman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">are the ones that used to walk in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">between the tribes peacefully because</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:38.880" style="s2">there were there were sort of outcasts</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:39.989" style="s2">in their own tribe to begin words if the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.880" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">intermarrying way they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.989" end="00:02:43.290" style="s2">communicating with other tribes</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:46.860" style="s2">nobody was offended or hurt by that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.290" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">anyway so when you really needed a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.860" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">peaceful communication between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:52.650" style="s2">tribes you had to go to the Shannons and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:54.630" style="s2">this is the case if you started tribes</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.650" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">today we have the last remnants of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.630" end="00:02:59.580" style="s2">tribes today in the world in New Guinea</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:01.110" style="s2">Botswana Brazil northern Canada with</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:03.260" style="s2">units these are the places where I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.110" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">studied for the past 10 to 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.260" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">check out what the original tribe was</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:09.569" style="s2">like that&#39;s doing proper anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:11.069" style="s2">the great thing today is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.569" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">then take all the interviews you did</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.069" end="00:03:14.910" style="s2">there and you map those communities and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:16.530" style="s2">discovered they were the same in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.910" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">Arctic and they were the same of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.530" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">silver and I were the same of the jungle</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">meaning we were all the same people</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:24.299" style="s2">40,000 years ago we&#39;re still basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">the same so we&#39;ve got a model for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.299" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">original tribe actually worked now we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:30.180" style="s2">can take the data on contemporary human</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:51.930" style="s2">is so instrumental for me and so darkest</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:55.260" style="s2">to go back to the original nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.930" end="00:03:57.690" style="s2">plastic tribe and check how that worked</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.260" end="00:04:00.359" style="s2">what master key was for patriarchy was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.690" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">what inner and outer circuit were what</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:12.120" style="s2">and of course shamanic cast which is the</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">million people if everybody was running</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.140" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">whereas once you had permanent</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:31.630" style="s2">in turn required written language once</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.460" style="s2">your written language you could create</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.460" end="00:04:37.690" style="s2">actually last for long periods of time</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:46.090" style="s2">language really took off for the</p>

<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">settlements arrive in history we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.860" end="00:05:00.670" style="s2">have much larger populations and support</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:03.790" style="s2">them because we&#39;re actually producing</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.670" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">food and the reason we can produce food</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.790" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">which is a higher level of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:11.260" style="s2">compared to the searching for food and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:13.720" style="s2">hunting means we can all support much</p>

<p begin="00:05:13.720" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">triggered the idea of progress and even</p>

<p begin="00:06:03.550" end="00:06:07.690" style="s2">means that we have to celebrate the</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">going because they hunt and they also do</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.819" end="00:09:16.869" style="s2">the warfare so they can&#39;t stay on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:19.059" style="s2">move anyway their circuit it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.869" end="00:09:21.459" style="s2">bigger than the inner circle where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.059" end="00:09:22.869" style="s2">women the masculine circle is bigger if</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.459" end="00:09:24.459" style="s2">you go to the image to north encounter</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.869" end="00:09:26.529" style="s2">you discover that winter camps and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.459" end="00:09:27.939" style="s2">summer camps the summer camps move in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.529" end="00:09:30.129" style="s2">much smaller areas and they&#39;re owned by</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.939" end="00:09:33.160" style="s2">metro arts and essentially their child</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.129" end="00:09:35.019" style="s2">rearing and berry picking right and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.160" end="00:09:36.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the larger circuit which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.019" end="00:09:38.829" style="s2">the winter camps they go much further</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.910" end="00:09:40.389" style="s2">they stay with the ice and they kill the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.829" end="00:09:42.339" style="s2">seals so they killed the moose and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.389" end="00:09:45.129" style="s2">bring the meat back into the tribe that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.339" end="00:09:47.110" style="s2">that&#39;s thrown as a pet turkey so they go</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.129" end="00:09:48.339" style="s2">into the dangerous unknown so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.110" end="00:09:50.379" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.339" end="00:09:52.990" style="s2">men take risks on a love of the women</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.379" end="00:09:55.119" style="s2">don&#39;t they physiologically in nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.990" end="00:09:57.429" style="s2">take much larger risk and they also die</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.119" end="00:10:00.100" style="s2">at a rate that women don&#39;t women die</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.429" end="00:10:02.559" style="s2">mostly from child-rearing and childbirth</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">and take risks when they give birth to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.559" end="00:10:06.790" style="s2">children in the tribe they did in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:09.429" style="s2">entire world until the nineteen sixties</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.790" end="00:10:11.290" style="s2">everywhere but men take risks when it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.429" end="00:10:13.299" style="s2">comes to the hunting and the warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.290" end="00:10:15.730" style="s2">just getting out there and spying and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.299" end="00:10:17.829" style="s2">checking out what&#39;s happening so you got</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.730" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">the phonics storytelling we would cease</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.829" end="00:10:23.139" style="s2">the priesthood needs to get the tribe on</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:26.110" style="s2">the moon tomorrow mm-hmm then you got</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.139" end="00:10:27.369" style="s2">the magical storytelling which is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.110" end="00:10:29.049" style="s2">story turning about the women of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.369" end="00:10:31.899" style="s2">children basically there&#39;s a container</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.049" end="00:10:34.029" style="s2">here safe space in the center run by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.899" end="00:10:35.470" style="s2">metric but the condition for you to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.029" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">part of this container and to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.470" end="00:10:38.949" style="s2">safe space run by the metric is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:40.779" style="s2">when the metric tells you to get on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.949" end="00:10:42.970" style="s2">move you need to be on the moon because</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.779" end="00:10:44.740" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s behind the matter or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.970" end="00:10:46.869" style="s2">tribe moves is dead so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.740" end="00:10:50.379" style="s2">traditional let&#39;s say absolute power of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.869" end="00:10:52.230" style="s2">women in the in the matriarchy yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.379" end="00:10:54.339" style="s2">is the funny thing when we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.230" end="00:10:55.749" style="s2">reinstituting equality in the genders</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.339" end="00:10:57.879" style="s2">they will only reinstitute the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.749" end="00:11:00.129" style="s2">absolutely natural to us it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.879" end="00:11:01.389" style="s2">weird that men should dominate women or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.129" end="00:11:02.920" style="s2">women should dominate men for that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.389" end="00:11:07.059" style="s2">matter and any culture where that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.920" end="00:11:08.750" style="s2">happens is an inferior culture if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.059" end="00:11:10.189" style="s2">look at the most superior culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.750" end="00:11:13.160" style="s2">planet Udine anything you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.189" end="00:11:15.560" style="s2">like education levels income levels etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.160" end="00:11:18.350" style="s2">you find two groups that stand out and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.560" end="00:11:21.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the parsees of India who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.350" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">Zoroastrians ironically and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.740" end="00:11:29.319" style="s2">Jews to this room yeah so this cocky and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">strong yeah I would call that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.319" end="00:11:34.329" style="s2">complementarity between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:37.430" style="s2">rather than better than the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.329" end="00:11:39.800" style="s2">egalitarianism for the benefit all so</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.430" end="00:11:41.480" style="s2">you maximize few talent you maximize</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.800" end="00:11:44.199" style="s2">masculine time you also maximize</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.480" end="00:11:46.610" style="s2">androgynous talent between the two so</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.199" end="00:11:48.350" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s born today&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.610" end="00:11:50.209" style="s2">evolutionary winner you wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.350" end="00:11:51.949" style="s2">around unless you had to play the role</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.209" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">that leads to the original tribe that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.949" end="00:11:56.389" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:58.100" style="s2">to role you play you today we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.389" end="00:12:00.290" style="s2">that yet but at least we can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.100" end="00:12:03.649" style="s2">that anybody born today has a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.290" end="00:12:06.019" style="s2">makeup that actually made sense okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.649" end="00:12:07.670" style="s2">that also means that we have can go back</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.019" end="00:12:09.410" style="s2">to the history of philosophy and we can</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.839" end="00:27:28.389" style="s2">the city itself changes so the city</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.879" end="00:27:31.729" style="s2">stops being horizontal and goes vertical</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.389" end="00:27:33.379" style="s2">and vertical is phallic that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.379" end="00:27:38.379" style="s2">yeah to begin with the people who do</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.809" end="00:27:41.359" style="s2">best in cities are women</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.379" end="00:27:43.489" style="s2">why because women are used to dense</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.359" end="00:27:45.080" style="s2">environments because the inner circle</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.489" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">the tribe is a dense environment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.080" end="00:27:47.839" style="s2">some women are nitpicking at each other</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.839" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">in and not out ok the urban environment</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.789" end="00:27:53.330" style="s2">is incredibly feminine in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.129" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t means the first way with</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.330" end="00:27:56.570" style="s2">digital today was the Instagram and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.129" end="00:27:58.519" style="s2">influences and all these things are very</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.099" end="00:28:07.879" style="s2">wipe it away and then we&#39;re gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.019" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">being horizontal instead being vertical</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.879" end="00:28:13.580" style="s2">and vertical doesn&#39;t necessarily benefit</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:16.309" style="s2">women more than men he could very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:18.379" style="s2">be more of the outer circle because the</p>

<p begin="00:32:21.179" end="00:32:24.659" style="s2">all sort of access to the data that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.919" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">the first thing they trade in because by</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.659" end="00:32:27.929" style="s2">having access to the data they can nail</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">it exactly what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.929" end="00:32:33.179" style="s2">and they can prove it with facts ality</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:35.429" style="s2">cuz all everything that happens from now</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.179" end="00:32:38.220" style="s2">on on our planet possibly the universe</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.429" end="00:32:40.110" style="s2">itself is being stored well power as</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.220" end="00:32:42.090" style="s2">data I guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.110" end="00:32:43.620" style="s2">and we&#39;re also figuring out that since</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.090" end="00:32:45.539" style="s2">information is never lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.620" end="00:32:48.389" style="s2">universe the universe itself is huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.539" end="00:32:52.710" style="s2">storage machine mm-hmm so all of history</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.389" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">is remembered meaning memory is the big</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.710" end="00:32:56.519" style="s2">thing with digital meaning since</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:58.590" style="s2">everything is there now and available</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.519" end="00:33:00.299" style="s2">you can check the data you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.590" end="00:33:01.830" style="s2">a kiss to all the world&#39;s libraries at</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.299" end="00:33:03.210" style="s2">once and you&#39;ve got an electron that</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.029" end="00:33:12.659" style="s2">meaning we can stop speculating and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.590" end="00:33:14.039" style="s2">coming up with wild silly fantasies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.659" end="00:33:15.779" style="s2">in fairy tales which is what television</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.039" end="00:33:17.429" style="s2">did with us in the last 50 years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.779" end="00:33:19.289" style="s2">suddenly television is dead because</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.400" end="00:33:27.910" style="s2">well YouTube is throwing at us</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.260" end="00:33:30.630" style="s2">increasingly factual reality mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.910" end="00:33:35.290" style="s2">again it&#39;s phallic remember it&#39;s phallic</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.630" end="00:33:37.720" style="s2">mm-hmm why because I like storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.290" end="00:33:40.570" style="s2">you cannot garden hunt and you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.720" end="00:33:43.240" style="s2">start war unless you&#39;re based in reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.570" end="00:33:45.700" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got a foundational</p>

<p begin="00:33:48.550" end="00:33:53.260" style="s2">animal right so young boys are trained</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.430" end="00:33:54.429" style="s2">to think factuality that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.260" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">mathematics is easier for guys</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.429" end="00:33:58.210" style="s2">especially when they go into engineering</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:59.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what 93% of the world&#39;s tech</p>

<p begin="00:34:07.420" end="00:34:10.840" style="s2">together the caring in society that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.340" end="00:34:12.700" style="s2">should be half the value anyways they</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.840" end="00:34:14.740" style="s2">can do okay but the men are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.700" end="00:34:16.090" style="s2">kickstart the whole thing and get it</p>
