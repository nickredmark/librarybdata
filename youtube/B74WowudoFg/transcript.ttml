<p begin="00:00:14.349" end="00:00:20.630" style="s2">last time we spoke it was not so long</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.910" end="00:00:24.770" style="s2">ago but you&#39;ve been in the headlights</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.630" end="00:00:30.460" style="s2">even more since yes since the release of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.770" end="00:00:32.689" style="s2">the book and and also the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.460" end="00:00:34.850" style="s2">interview with captain human</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.689" end="00:00:40.190" style="s2">yeah well that seemed to start a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.850" end="00:00:43.160" style="s2">new Plateau let&#39;s say of interest yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.190" end="00:00:48.079" style="s2">thought that yes I&#39;ve been in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.160" end="00:00:53.300" style="s2">headlines a lot and a rather unsettling</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.079" end="00:00:56.510" style="s2">amount I would say yeah and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.300" end="00:00:59.809" style="s2">to dwell on the captain human include</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.510" end="00:01:02.300" style="s2">too much because you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been made</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.809" end="00:01:05.420" style="s2">to talk so much about it I think you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.300" end="00:01:08.510" style="s2">probably tired about it but just one</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.420" end="00:01:12.850" style="s2">thing that I I think you demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.510" end="00:01:17.840" style="s2">very clearly about yourself and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.850" end="00:01:20.750" style="s2">about the saying that patience is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.840" end="00:01:24.500" style="s2">virtue that you actually in the end you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.750" end="00:01:27.770" style="s2">won out because she stayed calm and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.500" end="00:01:31.490" style="s2">explained what you actually meant and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.770" end="00:01:34.940" style="s2">the end she liked words and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.490" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2">actually was an inspiring example to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.940" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">lot of people yeah it seems to have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:42.650" style="s2">it although it isn&#39;t clear why it was it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:46.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t still isn&#39;t really clear to me why</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.650" end="00:01:49.580" style="s2">it became so incredibly widespread I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.310" end="00:01:51.860" style="s2">mean I think the interview itself on</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.580" end="00:01:54.040" style="s2">YouTube has something approximating 8</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.860" end="00:01:57.290" style="s2">million views but if you add the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.040" end="00:01:59.120" style="s2">commentaries to that lots of people have</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.290" end="00:02:02.410" style="s2">cut it up and commented on it I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.120" end="00:02:04.670" style="s2">it&#39;s I suspect it exceeds 20 million and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.410" end="00:02:06.200" style="s2">there was something about the interview</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.670" end="00:02:08.330" style="s2">that really attracted a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.200" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">amount of attention so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.330" end="00:02:13.220" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously part and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">parcel of the political tension that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.220" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">that&#39;s odd that seems to underlie</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:21.940" style="s2">virtually everything right now yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:24.650" style="s2">think it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.940" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">like the intern interview from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.650" end="00:02:30.950" style="s2">Platonic ideal steaks like this is if</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:32.630" style="s2">you want you want an interview but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.950" end="00:02:35.270" style="s2">illustrates the cultural world</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.630" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">everything that&#39;s wrong about not taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.270" end="00:02:42.770" style="s2">your opponent seriously and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:45.170" style="s2">always show that interview so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.770" end="00:02:47.000" style="s2">great great way to just introduce people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.170" end="00:02:49.070" style="s2">to what&#39;s wrong with the political</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:53.000" style="s2">discourse I think I have I have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.070" end="00:02:56.150" style="s2">hypothesis to run by you yes well so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.000" end="00:02:58.459" style="s2">imagine what&#39;s happening is this the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:03:02.270" style="s2">we&#39;re in the midst of a technological</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.459" end="00:03:05.209" style="s2">transformation and the online video</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.270" end="00:03:08.510" style="s2">services are displacing network and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.209" end="00:03:10.670" style="s2">cable television and the online print</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.510" end="00:03:14.260" style="s2">services are displacing the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.670" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">print media so let&#39;s say that okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.260" end="00:03:19.400" style="s2">there&#39;s increasing desperation on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:21.230" style="s2">part of the traditional media and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.400" end="00:03:24.050" style="s2">then let&#39;s say that as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.230" end="00:03:26.360" style="s2">that that I did that additional</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.050" end="00:03:28.549" style="s2">nervousness and instability first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.360" end="00:03:31.400" style="s2">many people are leaving second budgets</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.549" end="00:03:35.660" style="s2">are being cut and third there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.400" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">increasing desperation for to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.660" end="00:03:40.430" style="s2">market share and as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:42.890" style="s2">that more and more articles are</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.430" end="00:03:45.769" style="s2">polarized because they attract more</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.890" end="00:03:48.380" style="s2">attention and that that&#39;s driving the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.769" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">political polarization in part does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.380" end="00:03:57.620" style="s2">seem reasonable to you yes I do think</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">that seems reasonable and I do think you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.620" end="00:04:06.650" style="s2">also have a great need for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:10.070" style="s2">established media to debunk sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.650" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">the people who are popular on YouTube or</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.070" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">have podcasts and are free free from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:20.900" style="s2">the big media houses and the TV channels</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:25.190" style="s2">so you think it&#39;s also direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.900" end="00:04:28.580" style="s2">competition yes but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.190" end="00:04:31.640" style="s2">sort of a conscious effort I think also</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.580" end="00:04:33.590" style="s2">it&#39;s incompetent sometimes you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.640" end="00:04:37.000" style="s2">never never</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.590" end="00:04:43.370" style="s2">everything together like all bright</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.000" end="00:04:45.620" style="s2">lights extremism populism and they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.370" end="00:04:50.230" style="s2">a very hard time discerning what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.620" end="00:04:52.970" style="s2">and the real Nazis from just people</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.230" end="00:04:55.060" style="s2">having legitimate ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.970" end="00:04:57.590" style="s2">legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.060" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">yeah well that that&#39;s another issue</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.590" end="00:05:03.890" style="s2">right is that it&#39;s in the radical left&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:08.600" style="s2">interest to lump everyone who opposes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.890" end="00:05:13.400" style="s2">their their ideological attempts into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.600" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">single terrifying category because if if</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.400" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">they had to contend with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:21.890" style="s2">you can be reasonable centrist or even a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:24.200" style="s2">reasonable Center leftist and dispute</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.890" end="00:05:26.090" style="s2">the validity of identity politics as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.200" end="00:05:28.430" style="s2">framework for conducting a political</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.090" end="00:05:30.110" style="s2">discussion if you have to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.430" end="00:05:31.610" style="s2">reasonable people can do that then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.110" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">have to accept that reasonable people</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.610" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">can object your ideology and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:39.530" style="s2">implies that your ideology isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:42.670" style="s2">reasonable so there&#39;s every reason for</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.530" end="00:05:46.640" style="s2">people on the radical left to not only</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.670" end="00:05:48.680" style="s2">assume that their opponents are</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.640" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">reprehensible but to make the case that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.680" end="00:05:52.760" style="s2">they&#39;re reprehensible without ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:55.370" style="s2">bothering to scratch below the surface</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.760" end="00:05:57.530" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s happening too and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.370" end="00:05:59.300" style="s2">of course I never want to let the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.530" end="00:06:02.150" style="s2">universities off the hook and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.300" end="00:06:05.050" style="s2">the fact that the universities have</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.150" end="00:06:07.760" style="s2">allowed and encouraged the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.050" end="00:06:10.100" style="s2">reticle left ideology and the humanities</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.760" end="00:06:13.730" style="s2">and the social sciences is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.100" end="00:06:16.040" style="s2">completely inexcusable so I might even</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.730" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">prove fatal to the universities we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.040" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">see about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:23.480" style="s2">but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me universities</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.970" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">have been around a long time though the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.480" end="00:06:33.290" style="s2">last we spoke I was doing a piece on how</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:36.170" style="s2">radical feminism had been mandatory for</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.290" end="00:06:39.660" style="s2">a course long university and we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.170" end="00:06:44.070" style="s2">about that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:49.730" style="s2">was mandated to include you you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.070" end="00:06:49.730" style="s2">Butler in this course and I continued</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.600" end="00:06:55.500" style="s2">writing about the universities and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.790" end="00:06:57.930" style="s2">goes much deeper in swinging it goes</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.500" end="00:07:01.410" style="s2">even white if you look at the grants if</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.930" end="00:07:05.160" style="s2">you look at its we have ten ten billion</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.410" end="00:07:08.220" style="s2">crona&#39;s which are being distributed from</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.160" end="00:07:10.650" style="s2">the state and they are they have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.220" end="00:07:13.530" style="s2">gender mainstreaming that&#39;s is taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.650" end="00:07:18.030" style="s2">place in the you know universities when</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.530" end="00:07:21.510" style="s2">it comes to courses and the reading</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.030" end="00:07:24.390" style="s2">lists and the professors is also when it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.510" end="00:07:26.670" style="s2">comes to the grants so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.390" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">include a gender perspective or at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.670" end="00:07:31.350" style="s2">you have to specify why you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:34.260" style="s2">gender perspective right which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.350" end="00:07:38.010" style="s2">probably fatal yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.260" end="00:07:40.470" style="s2">so one of my friend of mine that I got</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.010" end="00:07:42.600" style="s2">to know him via his dog because I have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.470" end="00:07:45.000" style="s2">dog and so our dogs became friends and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.600" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">then we became friends so he made his</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.000" end="00:07:56.090" style="s2">giddy about Travis wild and wine</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:56.090" style="s2">droughts and and how do you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.230" end="00:08:02.610" style="s2">domesticated plants no gap yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.390" end="00:08:03.870" style="s2">the difference in behavior sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:07.500" style="s2">boring but it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.870" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">interesting one thing but he was about</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.500" end="00:08:10.950" style="s2">to not get his not getting grant because</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:14.790" style="s2">he didn&#39;t think you know gender</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.950" end="00:08:16.980" style="s2">perspective yep and so well I know now</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.790" end="00:08:19.320" style="s2">that and that&#39;s it ten years ago and now</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.980" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s spreading so I&#39;m getting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.320" end="00:08:26.220" style="s2">of stories about that so it&#39;s crazy the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.020" end="00:08:28.050" style="s2">universities are really it&#39;s shifted</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.220" end="00:08:30.450" style="s2">into second gear here in Sweden at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.050" end="00:08:33.890" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the same it&#39;s it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.450" end="00:08:36.300" style="s2">everywhere in the West I would say our</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.890" end="00:08:38.760" style="s2">government just handed down a budget and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:43.560" style="s2">every as far as I can tell from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.760" end="00:08:45.330" style="s2">initial response and every government</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.560" end="00:08:47.450" style="s2">program has to include a gender</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.330" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">perspective now in the same manner and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.450" end="00:08:51.960" style="s2">so our government is deciding to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.590" style="s2">problem that doesn&#39;t exist well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.960" end="00:08:55.660" style="s2">happened is that we&#39;ve accepted</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.590" end="00:08:57.280" style="s2">hoody we&#39;ve accepted equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.660" end="00:09:01.890" style="s2">as the measure by which we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.280" end="00:09:04.600" style="s2">judge the fairness of organization&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.890" end="00:09:06.790" style="s2">operations at the same time when the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.600" end="00:09:09.310" style="s2">social science research is stacking up</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.790" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">on the other side of the distribution to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.310" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">state ever more clearly and with ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">more with ever less doubt that as you as</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:22.060" style="s2">you flatten out the sociological</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:24.400" style="s2">landscape so that men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.060" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">treated more equally that the difference</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.400" end="00:09:31.150" style="s2">in their occupational choices widens</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">it&#39;s become crystal clear and the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.150" end="00:09:36.460" style="s2">response to that from the radicals is</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">that pseudoscience even though the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.460" end="00:09:41.800" style="s2">people who are doing these studies</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">aren&#39;t conservative there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.800" end="00:09:45.550" style="s2">conservatives in the social sciences and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:47.380" style="s2">so people do these studies and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.550" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">shocked by the results they publish them</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.380" end="00:09:51.970" style="s2">because they&#39;re good scientists not</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:54.460" style="s2">because these findings buttress their</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.970" end="00:09:57.520" style="s2">ideological position and Plus whose</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.460" end="00:10:00.910" style="s2">ideological position wasn&#39;t to wish that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.520" end="00:10:02.650" style="s2">as you flatten out the sociological and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.910" end="00:10:04.660" style="s2">political landscape you make men and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.650" end="00:10:09.030" style="s2">women more different who is hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.660" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">that no one was hoping for that so as</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.030" end="00:10:15.220" style="s2">the science stacks up the legislative</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:18.120" style="s2">and political attempts to silence it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.220" end="00:10:22.390" style="s2">to mount an ideological counter-attack</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.120" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">multiplied yeah and we need more we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.390" end="00:10:28.390" style="s2">more more general science now because</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">the differences are accelerating so no</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.390" end="00:10:39.910" style="s2">need even more yeah more of the same but</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:43.210" style="s2">I would like to jump into the to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.910" end="00:10:45.640" style="s2">book and see what because I read your</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.210" end="00:10:47.950" style="s2">book and or I didn&#39;t really read it I</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.640" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">actually listened to it which was I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.950" end="00:10:53.110" style="s2">really recommend to people because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:55.270" style="s2">know you did a fantastic job of reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.110" end="00:10:58.300" style="s2">the book by yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.270" end="00:11:00.520" style="s2">so thank money I was looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.300" end="00:11:02.830" style="s2">reviews on audible and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.520" end="00:11:05.320" style="s2">performance review and a content review</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.830" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">yeah the performance review is higher</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.320" end="00:11:09.000" style="s2">than the content review it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:10.410" style="s2">what what to think about that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.000" end="00:11:12.300" style="s2">know whether I should be happy about</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.410" end="00:11:13.829" style="s2">that or not happy about that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.300" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">much difference but I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.829" end="00:11:19.050" style="s2">comical I think you should stop writing</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">and you should just be a narrator of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.050" end="00:11:23.639" style="s2">books I think that&#39;s the takeaway well</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:27.029" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do an audio book version of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.639" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">maps of meaning oh really yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.029" end="00:11:29.879" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:32.279" style="s2">yes so that&#39;s coming and that that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.879" end="00:11:36.149" style="s2">like 25 hours long or something like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.279" end="00:11:38.790" style="s2">that probably more so yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.149" end="00:11:40.740" style="s2">first book I read as an as an audiobook</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.790" end="00:11:43.800" style="s2">was better angels of our nature by</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.740" end="00:11:47.670" style="s2">Steven Pinker hmm it&#39;s like 50 hours or</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:50.339" style="s2">something so it was a 25 hours it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.670" end="00:11:52.439" style="s2">so bad I think maybe I&#39;m out too because</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.339" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a longer book I&#39;m probably I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.439" end="00:11:58.920" style="s2">probably under estimating the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:12:01.259" style="s2">time we&#39;ll sit but the rule the rules in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.920" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">your book yeah I think the first rule</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.259" end="00:12:04.860" style="s2">stand up straight with his shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:06.779" style="s2">back I think that&#39;s really when you read</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.860" end="00:12:11.100" style="s2">the chapter it&#39;s it&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.779" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">chapter but I as last time when I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.100" end="00:12:19.250" style="s2">about to speak to you I I went into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:21.959" style="s2">Urim Pearson fan groups in Sweden and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.250" end="00:12:24.600" style="s2">asked them what what do you think I</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.959" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">should ask you or him and then one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.600" end="00:12:29.880" style="s2">the guys was sir he said I really like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:31.439" style="s2">the book but when he says stand up</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.880" end="00:12:34.529" style="s2">straight with your shoulders back</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.439" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">I think he should explain more how to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.529" end="00:12:40.170" style="s2">it and then a lot of the helpful other</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:43.050" style="s2">guys in the thread started giving him</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.170" end="00:12:46.860" style="s2">physical exercises how to strengthen the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.050" end="00:12:49.439" style="s2">muscles between the shoulder dress it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.860" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">was like a long thread on how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.439" end="00:12:55.170" style="s2">build your chest up like and then in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.740" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">end like after 20 or 30 comments like</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.170" end="00:13:00.630" style="s2">somebody suggests that maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:02.220" style="s2">you&#39;re done didn&#39;t mean it literally he</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.630" end="00:13:05.189" style="s2">also meant it figuratively</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.220" end="00:13:08.069" style="s2">so but it was no no no meanness or</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.189" end="00:13:10.579" style="s2">anything but then yeah it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.069" end="00:13:14.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the physical advice it was so</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.579" end="00:13:15.779" style="s2">mostly a sort of a psychological advice</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.040" end="00:13:18.829" style="s2">so yeah well it&#39;s a good place where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.779" end="00:13:20.780" style="s2">metaphorical and the literal meet yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.829" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">well and the important part</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.780" end="00:13:26.030" style="s2">that chapter I think apart is that I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:27.740" style="s2">really trying to make a case and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.030" end="00:13:30.230" style="s2">a case that needs to be made over and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.740" end="00:13:32.360" style="s2">over and over until people understand it</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.230" end="00:13:33.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a book I would recommend that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.360" end="00:13:37.280" style="s2">was recently written called the great</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.950" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">leveller Walter Shaw Dell and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.280" end="00:13:41.900" style="s2">study of inequality and it&#39;s a brutal</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.940" style="s2">book because one of the things she Adele</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.900" end="00:13:45.890" style="s2">does is he calculates inequality</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.940" end="00:13:46.930" style="s2">coefficients like the Gini coefficient</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.890" end="00:13:50.060" style="s2">which is a measure of inequality</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.930" end="00:13:51.860" style="s2">economic inequality and he looks over</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.060" end="00:13:56.300" style="s2">the empirical data to see if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.860" end="00:13:59.000" style="s2">relationship between the the left or the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.300" end="00:14:01.330" style="s2">right wing nature of a government and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.000" end="00:14:03.800" style="s2">the inequality in the society and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.330" end="00:14:05.960" style="s2">what you&#39;d hope because inequality is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.800" end="00:14:10.730" style="s2">actually a genuine problem you&#39;d hope</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.960" end="00:14:12.950" style="s2">that left-wing governments were better</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.730" end="00:14:14.990" style="s2">at regulating inequality than right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.950" end="00:14:17.750" style="s2">governments you&#39;d hope that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.990" end="00:14:19.940" style="s2">evidence for that whatsoever so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.750" end="00:14:22.910" style="s2">making a case in Chapter 1 that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.940" end="00:14:25.280" style="s2">hierarchies exist and because</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.910" end="00:14:26.870" style="s2">hierarchies exist inequality exists or</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.280" end="00:14:29.990" style="s2">at least the two things are are</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.870" end="00:14:31.970" style="s2">indistinguishable at many levels but</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.990" end="00:14:34.640" style="s2">that you can&#39;t blame the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.970" end="00:14:38.030" style="s2">hierarchy or inequality on something</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.640" end="00:14:41.060" style="s2">proximal like capitalism or Western</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.030" end="00:14:43.910" style="s2">society inequality is the rule all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.060" end="00:14:46.070" style="s2">way back down to crustaceans and so when</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.910" end="00:14:48.440" style="s2">the Marxists complain about inequality</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.070" end="00:14:50.210" style="s2">and how intractable it is well they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.440" end="00:14:52.460" style="s2">a point but when they blame it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.210" end="00:14:56.330" style="s2">capitalism they&#39;re not taking the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.460" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">problem seriously it&#39;s way worse than</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.330" end="00:15:02.900" style="s2">the Marxist think because inequality is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:05.720" style="s2">genuinely a problem now the yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.900" end="00:15:09.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem in in in a bunch of ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.720" end="00:15:11.780" style="s2">the first is is that those at the top</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.350" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">tend to get more and those at the bottom</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:19.520" style="s2">really not good now you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.420" end="00:15:21.770" style="s2">in a capitalist society in a modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.520" end="00:15:23.870" style="s2">industrial capitalist society people</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.770" end="00:15:26.180" style="s2">tend not to end up at zero so much and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.870" end="00:15:28.250" style="s2">that seems to be true it is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.180" end="00:15:30.680" style="s2">the case and and I think Pinker has done</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.250" end="00:15:32.780" style="s2">a good job of outlining this the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.680" end="00:15:33.590" style="s2">at human progress org are doing a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.780" end="00:15:36.050" style="s2">job of the two</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.590" end="00:15:39.610" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely the case that our modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.050" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">societies are making the poor much less</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.610" end="00:15:46.460" style="s2">absolutely poor so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve decreased</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:49.190" style="s2">poverty worldwide between 2000 and 2012</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.460" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">by 50% a massive accomplishment we</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.190" end="00:15:50.990" style="s2">should be partying in the streets about</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:53.390" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.990" end="00:15:57.589" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing accomplishment but</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.390" end="00:15:59.810" style="s2">inequality is still a problem so so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.589" end="00:16:04.490" style="s2">chapters about how deep the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.810" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">now the suggestion is is that to compete</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.490" end="00:16:08.150" style="s2">in a world where there&#39;s unequal outcome</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.260" end="00:16:10.550" style="s2">your best bet is to take the full</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.150" end="00:16:13.430" style="s2">tragedy of being full-frontal</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.550" end="00:16:16.430" style="s2">essentially right to open yourself up to</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.430" end="00:16:19.430" style="s2">the catastrophe of existence and to move</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.250" end="00:16:26.990" style="s2">that&#39;s your best bet and I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.529" end="00:16:31.130" style="s2">that now I can give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.990" end="00:16:33.950" style="s2">that we did research on a program called</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.130" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">the Future authoring program and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.950" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">part of the suite that&#39;s offered at self</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:40.700" style="s2">authoring calm and we did the research</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.670" style="s2">the idea was to produce psychological</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.700" end="00:16:45.560" style="s2">interventions that were very cost</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.670" end="00:16:47.510" style="s2">effective that could be distributed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.560" end="00:16:49.010" style="s2">many people but we wanted to test them</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.510" end="00:16:51.020" style="s2">because you never know if you&#39;re idiots</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.010" end="00:16:51.980" style="s2">intervention is gonna do something good</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.020" end="00:16:53.630" style="s2">or something bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.980" end="00:16:56.150" style="s2">that&#39;s like rule number one for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.630" end="00:16:58.250" style="s2">serious social scientists assume your</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.150" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">idiot intervention will either be</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.250" end="00:17:03.290" style="s2">useless or harmful because those are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:06.370" style="s2">most likely outcomes right and any</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.290" end="00:17:08.689" style="s2">social scientist who&#39;s truly credible</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.370" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">understands that those who don&#39;t are not</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.689" end="00:17:13.429" style="s2">educated properly so anyways we tested</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.829" style="s2">the future authoring program and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.429" end="00:17:19.550" style="s2">mostly tested it in Holland and we did</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:21.650" style="s2">some stratification by group so in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.550" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">Holland this was at the Rotterdam school</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.650" end="00:17:26.390" style="s2">of at the Rotterdam School of Management</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.429" style="s2">and Erasmus University we had thousands</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.429" end="00:17:31.910" style="s2">authoring program where they laid out a</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.910" end="00:17:36.950" style="s2">and they tried to optimize their lives</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.010" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">along they wanted to consider their</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.950" end="00:17:40.670" style="s2">friendships intimate relationships</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:42.800" style="s2">career choices educational choices</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:49.250" style="s2">outside of work to optimize across all</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:51.950" style="s2">those levels and then to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.250" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">catastrophic pitfalls so you write about</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.950" end="00:17:56.060" style="s2">what your life could be like if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:17:57.770" style="s2">could have what you needed in three to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.060" end="00:17:58.730" style="s2">five years and then what write about</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.770" end="00:18:00.530" style="s2">what your life could be like if</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.730" end="00:18:02.600" style="s2">everything fell apart on you and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.530" end="00:18:05.570" style="s2">things went bad all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.600" end="00:18:08.360" style="s2">so they all did this exercise now before</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.570" end="00:18:10.730" style="s2">the exercise the Dutch women were</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.360" end="00:18:14.180" style="s2">outperforming the Dutch men let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.730" end="00:18:16.520" style="s2">the Caucasians and the non-western</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.180" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">ethnic minority women were doing worse</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.520" end="00:18:20.870" style="s2">than the Dutch men and the non-western</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">ethnic minority men were doing worse the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.870" end="00:18:25.430" style="s2">worst of all four groups about an eighty</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:27.590" style="s2">five percent performance decrement</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.430" end="00:18:29.780" style="s2">compared to the Dutch women two years</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.590" end="00:18:34.670" style="s2">after the intervention they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.780" end="00:18:36.700" style="s2">better than the Dutch women right man it</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.670" end="00:18:39.350" style="s2">blew us away we couldn&#39;t believe and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.700" end="00:18:41.330" style="s2">that&#39;s research published with Michaela</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.350" end="00:18:44.870" style="s2">shipper and and and some other</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.330" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2">colleagues at from Holland and what was</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.870" end="00:18:48.760" style="s2">so interesting about that was that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.340" end="00:18:51.350" style="s2">psychological intervention seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.760" end="00:18:52.820" style="s2">remove the barriers that were produced</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.350" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">by what was hypothetically a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.820" end="00:18:57.650" style="s2">sociological barrier it might be that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">you&#39;re you know an immigrant to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.650" end="00:19:00.800" style="s2">country that you don&#39;t have your story</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:04.430" style="s2">straight because it&#39;s so complicated</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.800" end="00:19:06.500" style="s2">you know so you need a better plan</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.430" end="00:19:08.300" style="s2">so and that&#39;s part of standing up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.500" end="00:19:11.780" style="s2">like okay man make a plan for the future</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.300" end="00:19:14.990" style="s2">plan a good future and and move forward</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.780" end="00:19:17.420" style="s2">towards it and also one one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.990" end="00:19:23.150" style="s2">took away from it was from the chapters</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.420" end="00:19:27.680" style="s2">and take yourself seriously otherwise no</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.150" end="00:19:29.660" style="s2">one else will yeah if you don&#39;t stand up</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.680" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">for yourself you will get pushed down</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.660" end="00:19:35.420" style="s2">and pushed over and not be taking notice</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:37.640" style="s2">oh yeah yeah well I think the way you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.420" end="00:19:39.650" style="s2">take yourself seriously is you you start</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.640" end="00:19:42.380" style="s2">to construe yourself as a player in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.650" end="00:19:45.020" style="s2">catastrophe of the world know the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.380" end="00:19:45.890" style="s2">and this is a motif route 12 rules for</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.020" end="00:19:47.750" style="s2">life in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.890" end="00:19:51.410" style="s2">is a very dark book although it has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.750" end="00:19:54.260" style="s2">very optimistic central message the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.410" end="00:19:56.930" style="s2">darkness is life is tragic and tainted</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.260" end="00:19:58.310" style="s2">by malevolence but the optimism is</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.930" end="00:19:59.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a hell of a lot more to you than</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.180" end="00:20:02.780" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a message</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.310" end="00:20:04.370" style="s2">that&#39;s really good for people because</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.780" end="00:20:06.500" style="s2">everyone knows that life is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.370" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">catastrophe that&#39;s stated by malevolence</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:26.030" style="s2">trick to taking yourself seriously is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:28.550" style="s2">understand that your errors count they</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.030" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">make things worse like it really is the</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:36.020" style="s2">your act together at least because if</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.930" end="00:20:39.290" style="s2">you&#39;re fragmented and disillusioned and</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:14.300" style="s2">because the you you you you deal a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.290" end="00:21:17.030" style="s2">with Christianity and Christian thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.300" end="00:21:20.030" style="s2">both mostly with the Old Testament but</p>

<p begin="00:21:29.270" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">your teachings and when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:40.220" style="s2">this that we can really create hell for</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:43.010" style="s2">ourselves in this world and we have no</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.450" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">bet</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:55.970" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right is that hell is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:59.180" style="s2">definitely within our grasp yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.970" end="00:22:04.040" style="s2">and and I think with our ingenuity we</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.180" end="00:22:08.090" style="s2">can invent many kinds of health but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.040" end="00:22:11.480" style="s2">would also do you think there&#39;s a do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.090" end="00:22:14.060" style="s2">have the capacity to create paradise on</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.480" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">earth do you think is that within their</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.060" end="00:22:18.710" style="s2">grasp I think that that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:22.100" style="s2">struggle upwards toward you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.710" end="00:22:25.400" style="s2">thinking recently about this this image</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.100" end="00:22:27.680" style="s2">came to mind of st. Joseph&#39;s oratorio in</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.400" end="00:22:30.050" style="s2">Montreal which is a huge religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.680" end="00:22:32.690" style="s2">building it&#39;s one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.050" end="00:22:34.070" style="s2">Cathedral I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a cathedral</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.690" end="00:22:35.750" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s an oratorio</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.070" end="00:22:38.180" style="s2">although I don&#39;t know technically the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.750" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">difference but it&#39;s one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.180" end="00:22:42.890" style="s2">religious edifices in the world and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.660" style="s2">was built in the latter half of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.890" end="00:22:46.820" style="s2">century which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.660" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">because most buildings of religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.820" end="00:22:50.600" style="s2">significance weren&#39;t built that late but</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:53.300" style="s2">anyways it&#39;s up on Mount Royal so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.600" end="00:22:55.130" style="s2">up on the hill and so it&#39;s the city on</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.300" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">the hill right it&#39;s the Universal City</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.130" end="00:23:00.470" style="s2">on the hill it&#39;s an image of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:03.380" style="s2">it&#39;s its lattice like stonework lit like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.470" end="00:23:05.630" style="s2">the interior of a forest devoted towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.380" end="00:23:09.950" style="s2">the glory of being in God so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.630" end="00:23:12.110" style="s2">image of paradise we could say and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.950" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">it&#39;s at the top of a hill and you climb</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.110" end="00:23:16.730" style="s2">up to it as a consequence of a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.360" end="00:23:19.400" style="s2">large staircase set into the hill and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.730" end="00:23:20.660" style="s2">pilgrims went there quite regularly in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.400" end="00:23:22.790" style="s2">the 20th century who were often</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.660" end="00:23:24.200" style="s2">physically disabled and so they would</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.790" end="00:23:27.860" style="s2">struggle up the hill on their crutches</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">or or or or with their with their with</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.860" end="00:23:31.460" style="s2">their damaged limbs and with their</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:34.220" style="s2">illnesses and so they would struggle up</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:36.170" style="s2">the hill towards the heavenly City</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.220" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">essentially and that&#39;s what were to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.170" end="00:23:40.250" style="s2">that&#39;s correct that&#39;s it&#39;s a drama that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.830" style="s2">when people were acting out now</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.250" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">st. Joseph&#39;s also happens to be full of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.830" end="00:23:48.230" style="s2">crutches that people left there for</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:50.300" style="s2">which is quite interesting to see but</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.230" end="00:23:51.860" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t matter in</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.300" end="00:23:54.590" style="s2">some sense so much as the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.860" end="00:23:56.600" style="s2">meaning is all these damaged people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.590" end="00:23:58.700" style="s2">were carrying a terrible load like they</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.600" end="00:24:00.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t just subject to the normative</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.700" end="00:24:02.030" style="s2">tragedy of being they were also</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.200" end="00:24:04.160" style="s2">physically disabled would go there and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.030" end="00:24:06.740" style="s2">struggle up these hundreds of stairs as</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.160" end="00:24:09.500" style="s2">they were trying to ask sand instead of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.740" end="00:24:11.300" style="s2">descending and it&#39;s like well we</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.500" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">certainly believe in hell if we have any</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.300" end="00:24:15.860" style="s2">sense if you don&#39;t believe that human</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:18.020" style="s2">beings can create hell then you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.860" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">child you&#39;re a naive child you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.020" end="00:24:23.240" style="s2">nothing you know nothing about history</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">or yourself and you say well can we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">we bring paradise into being well no but</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.750" style="s2">maybe we can at least walk up the hill</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:32.360" style="s2">away from hell and who knows what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:34.370" style="s2">could do if we took it seriously if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.360" end="00:24:37.250" style="s2">took our the idea that we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.370" end="00:24:40.040" style="s2">shoulder our burden nobly and with truth</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.250" end="00:24:42.230" style="s2">if we took that seriously as serious as</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.040" end="00:24:44.210" style="s2">the hell should make you take it who</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.230" end="00:24:48.260" style="s2">knows what we could accomplish you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.210" end="00:24:50.060" style="s2">as I said we&#39;ve lifted you&#39;ve reduced</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.260" end="00:24:52.940" style="s2">the poverty rate in the world by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.060" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">from the year 2000 to the year 2012 and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.940" end="00:24:58.190" style="s2">something like 300,000 people are being</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:00.020" style="s2">attached to the power grid now worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.190" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s a week or a day</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.020" end="00:25:04.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s either of those metrics is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:07.640" style="s2">still pretty good your fastest growing</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.670" end="00:25:10.130" style="s2">economies are in Africa like you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.640" end="00:25:11.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve made amazing strides in the last</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.130" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">50 years and they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.960" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">accelerating and so I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:18.890" style="s2">the upper limit for us is if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:21.880" style="s2">dissolve ourselves into idiot identity</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.890" end="00:25:26.540" style="s2">politics and and and start a civil war</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.880" end="00:25:32.030" style="s2">no yeah so I think one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.540" end="00:25:34.310" style="s2">reasons why we have very I certainly do</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.030" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">but I think people in general do as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.310" end="00:25:39.470" style="s2">I have a very easy time imagining</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:41.150" style="s2">horrible horrible things and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.470" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">daydreaming about horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.150" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">horrible things that can happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:50.150" style="s2">horrible things that you could do and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:55.190" style="s2">and but it&#39;s very hard to imagine heaven</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.150" end="00:25:58.850" style="s2">for example yeah you get Dante&#39;s Inferno</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.190" end="00:26:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s I think he wrote about heaven as</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.850" end="00:26:06.980" style="s2">well I&#39;m not yes that&#39;s a really boring</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.680" end="00:26:10.340" style="s2">book like angels angels sing&#39; White&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.980" end="00:26:12.470" style="s2">dresses singing and stuff like that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.340" end="00:26:14.780" style="s2">it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t sound like heaven to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.470" end="00:26:17.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a hell sounds like hell</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:21.610" style="s2">right have a nice night for real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.660" end="00:26:23.299" style="s2">interesting because you know I would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.610" end="00:26:24.980" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.299" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">Christian&#39;s especially on the Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.980" end="00:26:28.730" style="s2">end have tried to force hell out of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:30.649" style="s2">human imagination over the last hundred</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.730" end="00:26:32.570" style="s2">years and maybe as a way of making</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.649" end="00:26:35.239" style="s2">Christianity more marketable although I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.570" end="00:26:40.309" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s worked but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.239" end="00:26:41.960" style="s2">that belief in hell metaphorically let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.309" end="00:26:44.629" style="s2">say although I tell you if you&#39;re in one</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.960" end="00:26:47.299" style="s2">of those situations it feels eternal so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.629" end="00:26:49.129" style="s2">that&#39;s something to keep in mind too but</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.299" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">I think it&#39;s unbelievably salutary</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.129" end="00:26:54.019" style="s2">because even though we can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:57.499" style="s2">heaven so clearly we can certainly say</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.019" end="00:26:59.359" style="s2">well at least it&#39;s not our switz right</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.499" end="00:27:01.639" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll agree on that whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.359" end="00:27:04.879" style="s2">it&#39;s as far away from our wits as you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.639" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">can get yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.879" end="00:27:09.169" style="s2">direction you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:10.940" style="s2">specific as you might like it to be but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.169" end="00:27:12.230" style="s2">that&#39;s also why I&#39;ve been suggesting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.940" end="00:27:14.659" style="s2">people that they think about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.230" end="00:27:17.149" style="s2">locally it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re not so sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.659" end="00:27:20.330" style="s2">what the Utopia might be and we know</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.149" end="00:27:22.850" style="s2">that collectively presuming a utopia</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.330" end="00:27:24.379" style="s2">also seems to be a dangerous thing but</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.850" end="00:27:26.539" style="s2">there are stupid things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.379" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">doing to make your life and the life of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.539" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">people around you more wretched and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:31.820" style="s2">miserable than necessary and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:35.480" style="s2">hypothetically the case that you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.820" end="00:27:37.340" style="s2">stop doing some of them so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.480" end="00:27:39.649" style="s2">good place to start it&#39;s nice and humble</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.340" end="00:27:41.629" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re less than you could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.649" end="00:27:44.359" style="s2">and you know it and there&#39;s things you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.629" end="00:27:47.330" style="s2">could do about that and you know it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.359" end="00:27:50.570" style="s2">so maybe maybe it would be okay to take</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.330" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">a step in the right direction I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.570" end="00:27:59.450" style="s2">you you say in the book and you often</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:28:01.639" style="s2">return to that basic truth and and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.450" end="00:28:06.049" style="s2">say that you you you arrive at this when</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.639" end="00:28:09.289" style="s2">you contemplate the horribleness of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.049" end="00:28:13.009" style="s2">20th century with all suites and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.289" end="00:28:15.109" style="s2">Gulag and that life there is life is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.009" end="00:28:19.149" style="s2">suffering and and you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.109" end="00:28:21.619" style="s2">produce away the pain of existence and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.149" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">there&#39;s no totalitarian that can reduce</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.619" end="00:28:27.259" style="s2">away that you could just forget it you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:30.019" style="s2">know in Venezuela now it&#39;s illegal to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.259" end="00:28:32.419" style="s2">less list the the cause of the death of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.019" end="00:28:34.249" style="s2">a child as starvation in the hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.419" end="00:28:36.169" style="s2">oh that&#39;s convenient</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.249" end="00:28:38.090" style="s2">oh yes isn&#39;t that something isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.169" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">something so there we go now we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.090" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">the Utopia it&#39;s now illegal to die of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:44.600" style="s2">starvation in a hospital in Venezuela or</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.970" style="s2">at least to have it listed and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.600" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">exactly it man there&#39;s a little slice of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.970" end="00:28:56.359" style="s2">hell for you yeah but I I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:59.539" style="s2">one of the it&#39;s easier to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.359" end="00:29:02.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy but it&#39;s it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.539" end="00:29:08.809" style="s2">stop doing causing harm and causing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.330" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">suffering than to arrive at bliss that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.809" end="00:29:17.960" style="s2">sort of a basic way we are very bad at</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:21.169" style="s2">people are pretty bad at having eternal</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.960" end="00:29:22.759" style="s2">bliss in this life yeah well yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.169" end="00:29:25.249" style="s2">not easy to conceptualize what it would</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.759" end="00:29:27.259" style="s2">be I mean you do see you do taste it at</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.249" end="00:29:29.090" style="s2">times you know you taste it with music</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.259" end="00:29:31.669" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s why there&#39;s imagery</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.090" end="00:29:34.220" style="s2">of angels and and and the heavenly hosts</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.669" end="00:29:36.919" style="s2">singing you know because people do get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.220" end="00:29:38.509" style="s2">taste of what paradise might be like</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.919" end="00:29:41.359" style="s2">when they listen to music which is why</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.509" end="00:29:43.309" style="s2">music is so powerful for people because</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.359" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">it speaks of a kind of transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.309" end="00:29:48.109" style="s2">harmony of the of the layers of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:49.970" style="s2">and it engages a person in that and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.109" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">get that as well when you&#39;re engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.970" end="00:29:53.269" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and deeply engaged</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:56.119" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and finding meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.269" end="00:29:58.759" style="s2">but I mean stepping rapidly away from</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.119" end="00:30:00.999" style="s2">hell might be a form of bliss you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.759" end="00:30:03.590" style="s2">to know that at minimum you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.999" end="00:30:05.119" style="s2">contributing to the terrible suffering</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.590" end="00:30:07.429" style="s2">of the world and maybe you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.119" end="00:30:09.529" style="s2">something to to lift the to lift the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.429" end="00:30:12.049" style="s2">burden in a positive way I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.529" end="00:30:14.419" style="s2">really complicated because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.049" end="00:30:16.299" style="s2">want everything to be easy that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.419" end="00:30:18.529" style="s2">good idea for utopia</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.299" end="00:30:19.970" style="s2">everything&#39;s blissful and easy and all</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.529" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is laying back and eating</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.970" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">peeled grapes you know it&#39;s if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:25.399" style="s2">nothing to that that would last more</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:28.309" style="s2">than a week you need and you need an</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.399" end="00:30:30.289" style="s2">adventure and you need a struggle but</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.309" end="00:30:32.570" style="s2">perhaps we could have the adventure and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.289" end="00:30:34.309" style="s2">the struggle without the pointless</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.570" end="00:30:36.169" style="s2">suffering and malevolence we could at</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.309" end="00:30:39.109" style="s2">least aim at that and then and who knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.169" end="00:30:40.700" style="s2">what we might transmute that into at</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.109" end="00:30:42.679" style="s2">least we might be able to transmute it</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.700" end="00:30:44.749" style="s2">into lives that are meaningful despite</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.679" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">their suffering that would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.749" end="00:30:49.399" style="s2">start and I do believe that that&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:50.360" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s an attainable</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.399" end="00:30:52.909" style="s2">realistic</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.360" end="00:30:57.350" style="s2">I believe that that we are strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.909" end="00:30:59.899" style="s2">as in our essence to rise above the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.350" end="00:31:01.879" style="s2">tragedy of existence and to live nobly</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.899" end="00:31:03.649" style="s2">and with purpose and honorably I believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.879" end="00:31:05.480" style="s2">we can do that and so that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.649" end="00:31:07.669" style="s2">12 rules for life is a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.480" end="00:31:10.820" style="s2">optimistic book because I also think</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.669" end="00:31:12.679" style="s2">that that&#39;s a believable message no</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.820" end="00:31:15.649" style="s2">one&#39;s going to say well believe that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.679" end="00:31:18.529" style="s2">well we&#39;re going to eradicate suffering</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.649" end="00:31:21.049" style="s2">and and malevolence it&#39;s like that no I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.529" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think so but we can constrain it</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.049" end="00:31:26.029" style="s2">within the confines of our own being hmm</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:33.139" style="s2">and that&#39;s good enough that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.029" end="00:31:36.889" style="s2">start about in Chapter rule number eight</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.139" end="00:31:38.690" style="s2">you say tell the truth that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.889" end="00:31:41.090" style="s2">rule number eight if you tell truth Abby</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.690" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">stop life and you write that it is our</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.090" end="00:31:46.549" style="s2">responsibilities to see what is before</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:49.159" style="s2">our eyes courageously and to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.549" end="00:31:50.809" style="s2">it even if it seems horrible even if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.159" end="00:31:54.889" style="s2">horror of seeing it damages our</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.809" end="00:31:56.929" style="s2">consciousness and half biases and then I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.889" end="00:32:02.090" style="s2">just thought about that for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.929" end="00:32:07.490" style="s2">and I reflected about during the when</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.090" end="00:32:13.820" style="s2">Isis invaded Iraq in 2014 I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.490" end="00:32:17.149" style="s2">for 2015 2014 was and I was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.820" end="00:32:19.370" style="s2">few who wrote about what was following</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.149" end="00:32:21.620" style="s2">that right then because nobody thought</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.370" end="00:32:25.970" style="s2">it would take over such a large part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.620" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">Iraq and then I was watching loads of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.970" end="00:32:30.679" style="s2">videos of mass killings and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:33.409" style="s2">decapitations and murders and I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.679" end="00:32:37.820" style="s2">seeing I had contact with eyewitnesses</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.409" end="00:32:41.690" style="s2">we are journalists whose name is nur</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.820" end="00:32:43.789" style="s2">aquino and it was horrible really really</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.690" end="00:32:47.779" style="s2">horrible most the most horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.789" end="00:32:48.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever seen and because I had contact</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.779" end="00:32:52.220" style="s2">with nur akeno&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.850" end="00:32:53.990" style="s2">had family members down there Assyrians</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.220" end="00:32:56.149" style="s2">Christians were being murdered and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.990" end="00:32:59.240" style="s2">driven from the homes and this was even</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.149" end="00:33:01.220" style="s2">before singe or were they took this sick</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.240" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">snakes there and they murdered</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.220" end="00:33:08.119" style="s2">whole people you see this yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:12.259" style="s2">it was really horrible episode for them</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.119" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">I mean of course that&#39;s the big deal but</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.259" end="00:33:17.690" style="s2">III felt I had a responsibility to to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.759" style="s2">see this series for myself yet not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.690" end="00:33:21.590" style="s2">listen to journalists who hadn&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.759" end="00:33:25.340" style="s2">because I was writing about it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.590" end="00:33:29.539" style="s2">myself and I could feel it changing me</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.340" end="00:33:32.119" style="s2">yeah this is the the absolute as close</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.539" end="00:33:35.179" style="s2">to absolute darkness as I have ever come</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.119" end="00:33:38.269" style="s2">home because it was it was it was not</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.179" end="00:33:40.669" style="s2">historical these four people some</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.269" end="00:33:43.749" style="s2">younger than me some older but they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.669" end="00:33:47.109" style="s2">it was happening as I was watching it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.749" end="00:33:52.220" style="s2">and then I thought about the quote by</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.109" end="00:33:54.710" style="s2">Nietzsche if you gaze into the abyss the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.220" end="00:33:58.789" style="s2">abyss also gazes into you I really felt</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.710" end="00:34:03.019" style="s2">that thinking about this one when I read</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.789" end="00:34:05.690" style="s2">your work and I thought that I would ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.019" end="00:34:09.139" style="s2">you that how how can you be certain that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.690" end="00:34:12.349" style="s2">you can defeat the darkness that when</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.139" end="00:34:14.029" style="s2">you face that I mean it sir I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.349" end="00:34:17.809" style="s2">think that you can be certain that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.029" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">can you say well if you go to face the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.809" end="00:34:24.260" style="s2">dragon to get the gold it wouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:26.510" style="s2">dragon if it couldn&#39;t eat you the issue</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.260" end="00:34:29.089" style="s2">isn&#39;t that there is the issue isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.510" end="00:34:32.169" style="s2">you&#39;re certain of success the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.089" end="00:34:34.700" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have a better pathway and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.169" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">so if you&#39;re going to confront the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.700" end="00:34:38.990" style="s2">dragon of chaos say and dare to attain</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.460" end="00:34:41.990" style="s2">the goal then you have to put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.990" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">on the line for it but paradoxically it</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.990" end="00:34:45.260" style="s2">seems the more you&#39;re willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.929" style="s2">yourself on the line for it the higher</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.260" end="00:34:49.970" style="s2">the probability of your success which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.929" end="00:34:52.789" style="s2">also the part of opening yourself up to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.970" end="00:34:55.609" style="s2">the catastrophe no in that&#39;s that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.789" end="00:34:57.589" style="s2">Christianity has increasingly occupied</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.609" end="00:35:00.500" style="s2">the theater of in my imagination because</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.589" end="00:35:02.440" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea that you know little</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.500" end="00:35:06.230" style="s2">even speaking psychologically that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.440" end="00:35:10.339" style="s2">whatever Christ represents whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.230" end="00:35:13.309" style="s2">image is it is in part the call to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.339" end="00:35:15.030" style="s2">accept the catastrophe of existence to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.309" end="00:35:16.980" style="s2">accept it voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.030" end="00:35:20.070" style="s2">because the fundamental story is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.980" end="00:35:23.910" style="s2">Christ went to his torturous betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.070" end="00:35:25.500" style="s2">with his eyes open right and well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.910" end="00:35:27.780" style="s2">a hell of a thing it&#39;s no wonder that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.500" end="00:35:31.140" style="s2">images never left people&#39;s imagination</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.780" end="00:35:33.620" style="s2">because that&#39;s there isn&#39;t you can&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.140" end="00:35:37.020" style="s2">any more of someone than that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.620" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2">and you might say well is it okay that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.020" end="00:35:42.750" style="s2">everything will be asked of us and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:44.910" style="s2">answer is it doesn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.750" end="00:35:46.740" style="s2">everything is going to be asked of you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.910" end="00:35:49.410" style="s2">like you&#39;re going to die you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:51.690" style="s2">have to accept that in one in one form</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.410" end="00:35:53.550" style="s2">or another the question is how well the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.690" end="00:35:56.220" style="s2">answer is well you have to open your</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.550" end="00:35:57.630" style="s2">arms you have to accept it you know and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.220" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.630" end="00:36:03.480" style="s2">that if you can if you can love fate</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:06.300" style="s2">deeply enough you can trance you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.480" end="00:36:08.250" style="s2">transcend your the limitations of your</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.300" end="00:36:10.590" style="s2">mortality it&#39;s something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.250" end="00:36:13.500" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that strikes me as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.590" end="00:36:15.390" style="s2">plausible possibility now you said when</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.500" end="00:36:18.450" style="s2">you were watching all those things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.390" end="00:36:22.470" style="s2">that changed you yeah you mean what did</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.450" end="00:36:24.980" style="s2">it what did it change you realize at</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.470" end="00:36:32.070" style="s2">least I did what you&#39;re facing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.980" end="00:36:34.290" style="s2">something real and if if evil has has</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.070" end="00:36:41.550" style="s2">meaning if there is evil that that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.290" end="00:36:43.020" style="s2">evil and what if that was sort of and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.550" end="00:36:45.360" style="s2">then you have a terrorist attack in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.020" end="00:36:47.790" style="s2">Sweden and you store the story things</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.360" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">like what would I what would I do if I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.790" end="00:36:52.140" style="s2">were in that situation and you speak to</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:55.980" style="s2">people who have who have relatives there</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.140" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">and you realize that you&#39;re very lucky</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.980" end="00:37:04.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re living in Sweden and not</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:06.690" style="s2">there because I I think it would not be</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.440" end="00:37:08.910" style="s2">very hard to take up arms against these</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.690" end="00:37:11.100" style="s2">people well that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.910" end="00:37:14.730" style="s2">that you realize you realize things</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.100" end="00:37:17.460" style="s2">about yourself if you gaze into that of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.730" end="00:37:19.500" style="s2">this well you know the terrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.460" end="00:37:21.360" style="s2">too is and this is a motif again that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.500" end="00:37:26.100" style="s2">also runs through 12 rules for life is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.360" end="00:37:28.410" style="s2">that well let&#39;s say when the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.100" end="00:37:29.910" style="s2">when the I&#39;ll give you a personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.410" end="00:37:32.610" style="s2">example so when I heard about what</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.910" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">happened in Cologne on the new on New</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.610" end="00:37:38.130" style="s2">Year&#39;s Eve and I see I had a situation</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:40.080" style="s2">where my son was mugged a number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.130" end="00:37:41.880" style="s2">years ago and he was mugged by a gang of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.080" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">kids that were brought into our</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.880" end="00:37:46.290" style="s2">neighborhood as a favor to them so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.360" style="s2">they could play basketball in a local</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.290" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">Boys and Girls Club and there was about</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.360" end="00:37:53.670" style="s2">six or seven of them 18 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:56.550" style="s2">they mugged my 13 year old son and took</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.670" end="00:37:59.550" style="s2">his his I think he&#39;d they took his cell</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.550" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">phone and he came home and he was shaken</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.550" end="00:38:05.310" style="s2">up mostly with anger because he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:07.560" style="s2">believe that six 18 year old young men</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.310" end="00:38:10.260" style="s2">could be so cowardly that they would</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.560" end="00:38:12.360" style="s2">gang up on a 13 year old kid like so for</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.260" end="00:38:15.330" style="s2">him it was a betrayal of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.360" end="00:38:17.250" style="s2">apart from being afraid but mostly it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.330" end="00:38:21.330" style="s2">was anger on his part and I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.250" end="00:38:23.490" style="s2">absolutely outraged so I contacted the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.330" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">police and I contacted the nearby club</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.490" end="00:38:27.450" style="s2">that had sponsored the kids and I said</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:30.030" style="s2">look this is what happened and they did</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.450" end="00:38:31.620" style="s2">nothing about it the club knew who it</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.030" end="00:38:33.870" style="s2">was and wouldn&#39;t release the names</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.620" end="00:38:36.750" style="s2">because of confidentiality and all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.870" end="00:38:39.330" style="s2">of other nonsense and I had this fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.750" end="00:38:41.940" style="s2">that went on for weeks about standing</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.330" end="00:38:44.040" style="s2">outside the Boys and Girls Club and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:48.630" style="s2">waiting for those kids with a lead pipe</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.040" end="00:38:51.390" style="s2">because I was not happy but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.630" end="00:38:55.110" style="s2">was and I couldn&#39;t pursue it with any</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.390" end="00:38:57.510" style="s2">degree of legal I couldn&#39;t pursue it to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.110" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">the degree that I wanted to in the legal</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:00.570" style="s2">framework because at the same time my</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.790" style="s2">daughter was very ill and that was</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.570" end="00:39:04.920" style="s2">taking precedence but you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.790" end="00:39:07.260" style="s2">these terrible fantasies come up over</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.920" end="00:39:09.780" style="s2">and over they very very dark fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.260" end="00:39:11.190" style="s2">and you know I talked it over with my</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.780" end="00:39:13.140" style="s2">son because I told him what was</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.190" end="00:39:14.550" style="s2">happening in my imagination because I</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.140" end="00:39:16.230" style="s2">wanted to let him know that this really</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.550" end="00:39:17.580" style="s2">bothered me that he was attacked and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.230" end="00:39:20.990" style="s2">that I wasn&#39;t going to put up with it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.580" end="00:39:23.850" style="s2">but I also understood that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.990" end="00:39:26.100" style="s2">seats I would have been I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.850" end="00:39:29.370" style="s2">have been a very weak man to not have</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.100" end="00:39:32.790" style="s2">had those feelings and then you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.370" end="00:39:35.610" style="s2">well lots of times it&#39;s the better man</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.790" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">that takes up arms but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.610" end="00:39:39.840" style="s2">necessarily the best man who takes up</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:41.610" style="s2">arms because maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.840" end="00:39:43.710" style="s2">place past that you might say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.610" end="00:39:46.230" style="s2">naivety and cowardice that stops you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.710" end="00:39:48.660" style="s2">from defending yourself you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.230" end="00:39:51.900" style="s2">then you transcend naivety and cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.660" end="00:39:55.230" style="s2">and then you become dangerous but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.900" end="00:39:59.460" style="s2">you can transcend dangerous maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.230" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a place past that and well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.460" end="00:40:09.330" style="s2">hope there is you say that I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:11.400" style="s2">if it&#39;s in the book but you said it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.330" end="00:40:15.930" style="s2">before that you have to develop some</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.400" end="00:40:19.950" style="s2">teeth because you can you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.930" end="00:40:23.550" style="s2">mistake weakness for virtue</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.950" end="00:40:25.790" style="s2">right and but in Christianity one one</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.550" end="00:40:28.830" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve struggled with</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.790" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">Christianity is the that the meek shall</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.830" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">inherit them yeah but you know I read</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:37.380" style="s2">the other cheek yeah other word there</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:41.220" style="s2">are the worldliness of Christianity that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.380" end="00:40:44.100" style="s2">I find very more grexit yeah not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.220" end="00:40:49.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a temperamental no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.100" end="00:40:51.540" style="s2">mistranslation cuz meek look that up</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.470" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a line that always</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.540" end="00:40:56.040" style="s2">bothered me and I when I did these</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:40:57.600" style="s2">biblical lectures last year which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.040" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">going to continue by the way as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.600" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">I can possibly manage it I looked up</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:08.580" style="s2">that line there&#39;s a couple of lines that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:11.780" style="s2">really really I couldn&#39;t forget them the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.580" end="00:41:14.340" style="s2">poor will always be with us that was one</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.780" end="00:41:16.850" style="s2">to those who have everything more shall</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.340" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">be given from those who have everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.850" end="00:41:22.050" style="s2">from those who have nothing everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:23.850" style="s2">will be taken away that&#39;s a rough one</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.050" end="00:41:26.550" style="s2">and then the meek shall inherit the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.850" end="00:41:28.710" style="s2">earth but meek is the wrong the word has</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.550" end="00:41:32.460" style="s2">slipped over time it isn&#39;t what it meant</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.710" end="00:41:34.500" style="s2">if you go back into the original if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.460" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">go back to the original text let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.500" end="00:41:40.650" style="s2">here&#39;s a better translation those who</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:43.460" style="s2">have swords and know how to use them but</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.650" end="00:41:47.670" style="s2">keep the machines will inherit the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.460" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">okay right that&#39;s a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.670" end="00:41:54.099" style="s2">but that&#39;s turning on the cheek</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:56.349" style="s2">the Christianity yeah well that goes</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.099" end="00:41:59.290" style="s2">along without resist not evil but look</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.349" end="00:42:00.790" style="s2">look I can tell you some some things</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.290" end="00:42:04.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned about that too</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.790" end="00:42:07.540" style="s2">so I&#39;ll give you a two example so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.440" end="00:42:09.880" style="s2">know there&#39;s been a lot of points for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.540" end="00:42:13.420" style="s2">in the last 18 months where things could</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.880" end="00:42:15.790" style="s2">have gone badly wrong so for example I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.420" end="00:42:17.770" style="s2">went to McMaster University about a year</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.790" end="00:42:20.020" style="s2">ago or there abouts and there was a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.770" end="00:42:22.810" style="s2">demonstration and it was quite obnoxious</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.020" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">I mean there was about 200 people there</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.810" end="00:42:27.310" style="s2">that were to see me to came to see me in</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.790" end="00:42:30.280" style="s2">about 50 protesters likely and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.310" end="00:42:31.630" style="s2">drowned me out completely and and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.280" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">there was a handful of them who were</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.630" end="00:42:36.010" style="s2">really I would say really not good</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">people like most of them were just</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.010" end="00:42:40.930" style="s2">foolish kids and foolish self-righteous</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">kids who were deluded by their idiot</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.930" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">professors and by their own resentment</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:47.260" style="s2">but there were four or five people there</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.260" end="00:42:51.790" style="s2">that crowd that you described that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.150" end="00:42:53.890" style="s2">descended into Iraq and I can tell who</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.790" end="00:42:55.780" style="s2">they were by looking at them they you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.890" end="00:43:02.230" style="s2">know they were people that that just</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.780" end="00:43:04.390" style="s2">they just I perhaps I&#39;m wrong but I I</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.230" end="00:43:07.020" style="s2">believe that I could see what they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.390" end="00:43:09.339" style="s2">and there were two of them behind me</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.020" end="00:43:10.990" style="s2">woman and a man the woman wasn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.339" end="00:43:13.720" style="s2">so bad but the man was pretty bad and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.990" end="00:43:15.819" style="s2">they were blaring air horns at me an air</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.720" end="00:43:18.310" style="s2">horn at me I&#39;m close enough to damage my</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.819" end="00:43:20.200" style="s2">hearing which I was not the least bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.310" end="00:43:22.119" style="s2">impressed about and I told them I said</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.200" end="00:43:24.609" style="s2">look you can blow your damn air horn but</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.119" end="00:43:26.230" style="s2">if you get it too close to me well I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.609" end="00:43:29.829" style="s2">went I went and had a word with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.230" end="00:43:31.869" style="s2">police at that point but you know so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.829" end="00:43:38.109" style="s2">it was quite it was quite provoking and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.869" end="00:43:44.829" style="s2">and and pushy and but I just I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.109" end="00:43:47.170" style="s2">most of it was foolishness and I mostly</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.829" end="00:43:49.450" style="s2">watched and I tried to give my talk and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.170" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">it was completely drown out and then we</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.450" end="00:43:53.050" style="s2">had to leave and I gave the rest of my</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:55.180" style="s2">talk outside but you know all of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.050" end="00:43:57.849" style="s2">was filmed and then it was put up on</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.180" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">YouTube and all of the consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.849" end="00:44:01.750" style="s2">that holding my temper all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.880" style="s2">consequence of that was positive and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.750" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve really learned and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.880" end="00:44:07.780" style="s2">it is associate</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:09.940" style="s2">with this idea resist not evil and also</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.780" end="00:44:13.089" style="s2">of turning the other cheek it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.940" end="00:44:15.880" style="s2">like you can&#39;t respond it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.089" end="00:44:17.380" style="s2">don&#39;t and then with that Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.880" end="00:44:19.510" style="s2">interview you know it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.380" end="00:44:23.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a good really good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.510" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2">is that ain&#39;t no one maybe I managed it</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.890" end="00:44:27.970" style="s2">because I have had quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:31.300" style="s2">experience now dealing with hostile</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.970" end="00:44:36.460" style="s2">people and hostile press let&#39;s say but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.300" end="00:44:38.140" style="s2">I was able fortunately to stay detached</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.460" end="00:44:41.380" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.140" end="00:44:44.260" style="s2">with with maybe with even with a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.380" end="00:44:47.140" style="s2">a sense of humor during the interview</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.260" end="00:44:48.730" style="s2">and not take it personally and not get</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.140" end="00:44:52.210" style="s2">offended by it even though what was</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.730" end="00:44:53.830" style="s2">happening was deeply wrong there was an</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.210" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">element of being able to be detached</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.830" end="00:44:58.540" style="s2">about it and that worked you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:03.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t really fight with her I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.540" end="00:45:07.240" style="s2">allow her to set the linguistic agenda</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.310" end="00:45:09.550" style="s2">let&#39;s say but I didn&#39;t defend myself any</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.240" end="00:45:11.410" style="s2">more than was absolutely necessary you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.550" end="00:45:14.380" style="s2">know it&#39;s minimal necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.410" end="00:45:19.330" style="s2">something like that and that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.380" end="00:45:25.390" style="s2">overwhelmingly it was overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.330" end="00:45:30.760" style="s2">well-received yes I think it was really</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.390" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">I think the detachment sometimes is when</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.760" end="00:45:36.700" style="s2">you&#39;re in a public situation it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.849" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">of it&#39;s different it&#39;s different when</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.700" end="00:45:41.380" style="s2">you if you meet someone in streets if</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:43.990" style="s2">you&#39;re one-on-one and they say stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.380" end="00:45:46.420" style="s2">you or if you&#39;re at a dinner in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.990" end="00:45:49.330" style="s2">personal setting or something but when</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.420" end="00:45:53.530" style="s2">you&#39;re in a public setting you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.330" end="00:45:55.420" style="s2">basically a you&#39;re on a scene so you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.530" end="00:45:58.119" style="s2">you can be detached because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.420" end="00:46:00.700" style="s2">really the whole you that disparity says</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.119" end="00:46:03.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the avatar of yourself or so to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.700" end="00:46:07.930" style="s2">speak or a role you and you inhabit so</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.820" end="00:46:10.450" style="s2">you can have you can have patience not</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.930" end="00:46:12.250" style="s2">not you you but but I mean as a person</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.450" end="00:46:13.930" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to take it so personal I</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.250" end="00:46:15.099" style="s2">think people make that mistake and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.930" end="00:46:17.589" style="s2">think personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.099" end="00:46:18.870" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing too is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.589" end="00:46:20.010" style="s2">like it&#39;s not easy to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.870" end="00:46:21.600" style="s2">when you should take something</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.010" end="00:46:23.580" style="s2">personally and when you shouldn&#39;t like I</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.600" end="00:46:28.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t give you a good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.580" end="00:46:30.630" style="s2">too from politics like years ago who was</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.290" end="00:46:34.020" style="s2">running for I think it was Mondale I</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.630" end="00:46:38.430" style="s2">think so I might have this wrong but he</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.020" end="00:46:40.740" style="s2">was he was governor of Massachusetts now</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.430" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">who was that who ran for governor of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.740" end="00:46:49.290" style="s2">Massachusetts Oh anyways it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:50.970" style="s2">Mondale I don&#39;t believe but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.290" end="00:46:55.650" style="s2">matter he was governor of Massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.970" end="00:46:57.360" style="s2">and he had released a prisoner or his</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.650" end="00:46:59.910" style="s2">play or his prison system and released a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.360" end="00:47:02.340" style="s2">prisoner who immediately raped someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.910" end="00:47:04.980" style="s2">and he was being raked over the coals on</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.340" end="00:47:06.660" style="s2">a TV show about about the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.980" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">has happened I think the rapists name</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.660" end="00:47:09.030" style="s2">was Willie Horton if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:11.880" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.030" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">Dukakis it was it was Dukakis when</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.880" end="00:47:16.860" style="s2">Dukakis was running for president and a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:21.210" style="s2">journalist asked him well how would you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.860" end="00:47:24.330" style="s2">feel if Willie Horton had raped your</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.210" end="00:47:30.270" style="s2">wife or your daughter and Dukakis gave a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.330" end="00:47:32.520" style="s2">very I would say Placid answer and it it</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.270" end="00:47:34.020" style="s2">was one of the things that ensured he</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.520" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">was not going to be elected president</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.020" end="00:47:40.470" style="s2">president and what he should have said</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:44.100" style="s2">was my imagination would immediately go</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.470" end="00:47:45.870" style="s2">to the darkest possible place but</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.100" end="00:47:48.300" style="s2">because I&#39;m a civilized person and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.870" end="00:47:52.140" style="s2">understand that that pathway leads to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.300" end="00:47:54.060" style="s2">nothing but mayhem I&#39;d be willing to let</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.140" end="00:47:56.930" style="s2">the legal system take that moral</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.060" end="00:48:00.450" style="s2">obligation from my shoulders because</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.930" end="00:48:03.770" style="s2">otherwise everything gets worse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.450" end="00:48:08.130" style="s2">the right response the first response is</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.770" end="00:48:11.400" style="s2">mess with my family at your peril and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:14.730" style="s2">the second response is yeah but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.400" end="00:48:17.190" style="s2">get to start a feud I don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.730" end="00:48:19.350" style="s2">destabilize the entire society in my</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.190" end="00:48:23.970" style="s2">pursuit of what you might regard as</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.350" end="00:48:26.070" style="s2">justifiable revenge right and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.970" end="00:48:27.240" style="s2">part of that idea of having a sword but</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.070" end="00:48:30.870" style="s2">keeping it sheathed</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.240" end="00:48:32.320" style="s2">right and it is the opposite of of and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.870" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">talked about that in rule</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.320" end="00:48:38.110" style="s2">eleven don&#39;t bother children with an ax</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:40.060" style="s2">skateboarding which is in part I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.110" end="00:48:41.980" style="s2">a bit of a diatribe against the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.060" end="00:48:46.530" style="s2">that the way that you make men good is</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.980" end="00:48:51.490" style="s2">by making them wheat yeah it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.530" end="00:48:53.590" style="s2">uninformed and and naive uninformed and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.490" end="00:48:55.840" style="s2">malicious idea all of those things at</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.590" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">the same time you you make men good by</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.840" end="00:49:00.790" style="s2">making them unbelievably strong and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:03.250" style="s2">dangerous and then asking them politely</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.790" end="00:49:09.810" style="s2">to hold themselves in abeyance at all</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.250" end="00:49:12.820" style="s2">times and also I think dangerous is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.810" end="00:49:16.330" style="s2">an effect of being strong I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.820" end="00:49:18.280" style="s2">not something if you are strong then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.330" end="00:49:20.950" style="s2">have the capacity to be dangerous right</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.280" end="00:49:24.850" style="s2">it&#39;s not something separate from being</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.950" end="00:49:27.790" style="s2">strong so all right well it&#39;s people are</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.469" end="00:51:07.190" style="s2">you know and he told me quite clearly</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.209" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">that he could have easily been like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.190" end="00:51:11.390" style="s2">hyper delinquent when he was a kid but</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:13.579" style="s2">decided that he was because he&#39;s you</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.579" end="00:51:19.309" style="s2">and he decided he was going to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.039" end="00:51:21.380" style="s2">person instead and you you can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.309" end="00:51:24.199" style="s2">good person without the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.380" end="00:51:25.940" style="s2">malevolence interestingly enough and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.199" end="00:51:28.579" style="s2">know maybe that&#39;s one of the reasons if</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.940" end="00:51:30.440" style="s2">you think about it metaphysically let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.579" end="00:51:32.329" style="s2">say I mean one question is always be</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.440" end="00:51:34.519" style="s2">well white why is there evil in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.329" end="00:51:37.459" style="s2">world and I mean this is only a partial</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.519" end="00:51:39.739" style="s2">answer but it&#39;s possible that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.459" end="00:51:41.719" style="s2">fully develop your capacity for good</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.739" end="00:51:44.660" style="s2">without also developing your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.719" end="00:51:46.989" style="s2">for evil because you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.660" end="00:51:49.699" style="s2">do things even if you won&#39;t do them I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.989" end="00:51:52.069" style="s2">mean even if it&#39;s a matter of learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.699" end="00:51:53.029" style="s2">how to withstand temptation and until</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.069" end="00:51:55.160" style="s2">you&#39;re in a position where that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.029" end="00:51:57.499" style="s2">temptation is real you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.160" end="00:51:59.299" style="s2">withstanding anything hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.499" end="00:52:01.819" style="s2">so you know if you&#39;re not sleeping with</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.299" end="00:52:03.319" style="s2">a hundred women a year because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.819" end="00:52:04.999" style="s2">not lining up to sleep with you that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.319" end="00:52:15.739" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make you moral it just makes you</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.999" end="00:52:19.549" style="s2">undesirable yeah yeah probably this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.739" end="00:52:27.140" style="s2">perhaps one of the reasons that bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.549" end="00:52:29.059" style="s2">or so or so they people want to be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.140" end="00:52:32.029" style="s2">bad guy and they define bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.059" end="00:52:34.430" style="s2">interesting in movies and yes and in</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.029" end="00:52:37.339" style="s2">series TV series and and also this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.430" end="00:52:40.130" style="s2">part of the actually a part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.339" end="00:52:42.469" style="s2">Christianity which I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.130" end="00:52:46.630" style="s2">interesting is that the prodigal the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.469" end="00:52:50.829" style="s2">Sheep returning to the curb and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.630" end="00:52:54.140" style="s2">prodigal son and and you find that in</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.829" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">like the most awful criminal who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.140" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">starting to have doubts well that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">one of the best characters in movies I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:05.140" style="s2">mean the the awful villain who&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:07.570" style="s2">second thoughts and then in the end</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.140" end="00:53:10.920" style="s2">turns out to have a heart of gold yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.570" end="00:53:14.020" style="s2">yes yes but if you if you are the lamb</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.920" end="00:53:18.700" style="s2">that&#39;s much more that&#39;s a boring movie</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.020" end="00:53:22.840" style="s2">like like the lamb who&#39;s who&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.700" end="00:53:24.820" style="s2">done anything wrong can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.840" end="00:53:26.560" style="s2">because you can&#39;t yeah yeah well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.820" end="00:53:27.850" style="s2">an interesting there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.560" end="00:53:30.340" style="s2">scene in Revelation</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.850" end="00:53:32.380" style="s2">so in Revelation which is a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.340" end="00:53:34.420" style="s2">book it&#39;s like a hallucinate it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.380" end="00:53:36.460" style="s2">hallucinogenic trip in fact I think it</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.420" end="00:53:39.160" style="s2">probably is a hallucinogenic trip</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.460" end="00:53:41.140" style="s2">that&#39;s my suspicions so Christ comes</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.160" end="00:53:43.690" style="s2">back with a sword in his mouth and he</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.140" end="00:53:45.580" style="s2">judges humanity and so he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.690" end="00:53:47.619" style="s2">merciful in the Gospels but in</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.580" end="00:53:50.110" style="s2">Revelation he&#39;s the ultimate judge and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.619" end="00:53:52.690" style="s2">the reason for that is that any ideal is</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.110" end="00:53:56.650" style="s2">a judge right if you hold something up</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.690" end="00:53:59.260" style="s2">as an ideal then you&#39;re reflected poorly</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.650" end="00:54:02.550" style="s2">in the mirror of that ideal so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.260" end="00:54:05.619" style="s2">instantly a judge and there are far more</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.550" end="00:54:08.380" style="s2">damned than saved in in in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.619" end="00:54:11.740" style="s2">Revelation story but Christ tells people</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.380" end="00:54:14.470" style="s2">when he judges them I&#39;m it&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.740" end="00:54:19.630" style="s2">paraphrasing but but but the meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.470" end="00:54:20.350" style="s2">is is appropriate if you&#39;re hot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.630" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.350" end="00:54:26.109" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s commendable if you&#39;re cold</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:28.660" style="s2">that&#39;s okay but if you&#39;re lukewarm then</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.109" end="00:54:30.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll vomit you out of my mouth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.660" end="00:54:33.130" style="s2">the line and that&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.310" end="00:54:36.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s again it&#39;s an echo of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.130" end="00:54:39.670" style="s2">what you just described it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.100" end="00:54:41.830" style="s2">there&#39;s no virtue in in non-commitment</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.670" end="00:54:46.060" style="s2">right there&#39;s no virtue in weak</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.830" end="00:54:48.970" style="s2">harmlessness in fact and you see that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.060" end="00:54:52.320" style="s2">too I mean when when Hannah Arendt wrote</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.970" end="00:54:54.580" style="s2">wrote her her book on Eichmann and in</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.320" end="00:54:57.460" style="s2">Jerusalem it&#39;s like men in Jerusalem I</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.580" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">believe the banality of evil she talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.460" end="00:55:02.650" style="s2">about Eichmann and Eichmann was one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:07.410" style="s2">these characters who was a lamb right he</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.650" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">he he was he wasn&#39;t your spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.410" end="00:55:13.730" style="s2">cartoon book villain he was the heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:15.619" style="s2">this kind of soft guy next door who sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.730" end="00:55:18.109" style="s2">of went along to get along and he</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.619" end="00:55:20.359" style="s2">happened to be in a hierarchy where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.109" end="00:55:23.329" style="s2">goal was to eradicate the Jews but who</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.359" end="00:55:26.450" style="s2">is he to question the hierarchy hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.329" end="00:55:28.490" style="s2">no and so she titled her book the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.450" end="00:55:30.289" style="s2">banality of evil and I always thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.490" end="00:55:35.150" style="s2">she had the title backwards it should</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.289" end="00:55:42.049" style="s2">have been the evil of banality that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.150" end="00:55:48.410" style="s2">I haven&#39;t thought of that that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.049" end="00:55:50.569" style="s2">that&#39;s a deep thought I just I read a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.410" end="00:55:55.519" style="s2">couple of Christian critiques of your of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.569" end="00:55:59.569" style="s2">your your thoughts and your your book</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.519" end="00:56:05.450" style="s2">and one of the one of the critiques was</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.569" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">that you you think that because people</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.450" end="00:56:12.980" style="s2">have within the grasp to do good and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:15.170" style="s2">evil by themselves you are committing to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.980" end="00:56:17.809" style="s2">a Christian heresy called Pelagianism</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.170" end="00:56:20.509" style="s2">yeah yeah see I don&#39;t really believe</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.809" end="00:56:23.809" style="s2">that yeah I don&#39;t really believe that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.509" end="00:56:27.319" style="s2">mean but it&#39;s very difficult because the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.809" end="00:56:30.019" style="s2">Houston orthodoxy then you you can only</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.319" end="00:56:32.359" style="s2">do good because of our sinful nature you</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.019" end="00:56:36.440" style="s2">can only do good by the grace of God so</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.359" end="00:56:37.220" style="s2">we are if we have if we are not sinful</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.440" end="00:56:41.140" style="s2">in our nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.220" end="00:56:45.710" style="s2">if we deny that then you basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.140" end="00:56:49.250" style="s2">having made committing vanity because we</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.710" end="00:56:51.410" style="s2">claim we are so strong like us right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.250" end="00:56:54.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s a claim that I&#39;ve steam</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.410" end="00:56:57.880" style="s2">getting from another actually a critique</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.680" end="00:57:00.789" style="s2">that I was thought that I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.880" end="00:57:04.460" style="s2">hear your response it was no critique</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.789" end="00:57:07.940" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s it&#39;s an unbelievably deep</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.460" end="00:57:11.059" style="s2">problem so the first thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.940" end="00:57:13.339" style="s2">you can only speak metaphorically about</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.059" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">such things in some sense so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.339" end="00:57:19.309" style="s2">the Christian claim is that Christ&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:23.390" style="s2">sacrifice redeemed us and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.309" end="00:57:24.810" style="s2">that&#39;s true but we still have to do the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.390" end="00:57:26.940" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.810" end="00:57:29.550" style="s2">you might say well how can both of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.940" end="00:57:33.720" style="s2">things be the case simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.550" end="00:57:39.600" style="s2">the answer is well it depends on your</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.720" end="00:57:42.060" style="s2">view of time so and I can&#39;t explain it</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.600" end="00:57:43.890" style="s2">any deeper than that so I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.060" end="00:57:46.650" style="s2">because it would take forever but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.890" end="00:57:49.220" style="s2">would also say I do believe that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.650" end="00:57:51.690" style="s2">should step forward to do good humbly I</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.220" end="00:57:53.430" style="s2">do believe that if you&#39;re going to step</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.690" end="00:57:56.810" style="s2">forward to do good that you should do it</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.430" end="00:58:00.570" style="s2">well guided by the by the divine images</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.810" end="00:58:02.760" style="s2">I do I do believe that you&#39;re likely to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.570" end="00:58:04.740" style="s2">err in your judgment of what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.760" end="00:58:07.200" style="s2">which is why I entitled the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.740" end="00:58:09.450" style="s2">don&#39;t tell the truth or at least don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.200" end="00:58:11.910" style="s2">lie it isn&#39;t obvious to me that you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.450" end="00:58:14.070" style="s2">discern the truth but it is obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.910" end="00:58:17.400" style="s2">me that sometimes you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.070" end="00:58:22.710" style="s2">lying yeah and you could stop doing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.400" end="00:58:24.840" style="s2">and so I think that those critiques are</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.710" end="00:58:26.610" style="s2">now but then I would also invert the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.840" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">criticism and I would say that part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.610" end="00:58:31.020" style="s2">the danger of modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">Christianity in particular I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.020" end="00:58:36.770" style="s2">this is quite the same with the Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:39.030" style="s2">Christian types is that by assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.770" end="00:58:42.570" style="s2">everything good is done by the grace of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.030" end="00:58:45.630" style="s2">God you reduce the burden of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.570" end="00:58:48.570" style="s2">imitation of Christ the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.630" end="00:58:51.660" style="s2">does it mean to believe in Christ let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.570" end="00:58:54.570" style="s2">say and one answer to that would be to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.660" end="00:58:59.070" style="s2">say I regard the statement that Christ&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.570" end="00:59:01.590" style="s2">crucifixion redeemed me I regard that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.070" end="00:59:03.780" style="s2">statement as true say I&#39;m a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.590" end="00:59:06.690" style="s2">okay well that&#39;s one definition here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.780" end="00:59:10.530" style="s2">another definition pick up your cross</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.690" end="00:59:12.570" style="s2">and walk up the goddamn hill and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.530" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">the proper definition as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.570" end="00:59:17.270" style="s2">concerned and so and this is a Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:19.830" style="s2">and critic criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.270" end="00:59:22.050" style="s2">institutionalized Christianity which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.830" end="00:59:25.500" style="s2">that it lifts it made the moral burden</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.050" end="00:59:29.370" style="s2">to light because the burden is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.500" end="00:59:31.610" style="s2">to be confront evil constrained in your</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.370" end="00:59:34.890" style="s2">own heart except the tragedy of being</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.610" end="00:59:38.180" style="s2">pick up the load of mortality and walk</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.890" end="00:59:40.100" style="s2">uphill it&#39;s like god that&#39;s rough man</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.180" end="00:59:42.020" style="s2">so and then young wrote about that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.100" end="00:59:43.580" style="s2">know because he was interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.020" end="00:59:46.220" style="s2">Nietzsche and critique and he said look</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.580" end="00:59:48.020" style="s2">you got to understand that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.220" end="00:59:51.110" style="s2">cynical about the Catholics and their</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.020" end="00:59:53.120" style="s2">idea that you&#39;ve been redeemed by an</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.110" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">external source say it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.120" end="00:59:57.470" style="s2">not precisely that clear will parody a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="01:00:00.890" style="s2">bit for the sake of argument and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.470" end="01:00:02.630" style="s2">you can also be cynical about the idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.890" end="01:00:05.150" style="s2">that you can go in and confess and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.630" end="01:00:07.580" style="s2">receive absolution and walk out sin free</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.150" end="01:00:09.290" style="s2">but what you have to understand is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.580" end="01:00:12.260" style="s2">church is somewhat merciful in its</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.290" end="01:00:14.330" style="s2">endeavors because it&#39;s trying to also</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.260" end="01:00:16.750" style="s2">free people from the intolerable</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.330" end="01:00:19.220" style="s2">consciousness of their own insufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.750" end="01:00:20.750" style="s2">you know cuz I could say to you well you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.220" end="01:00:23.570" style="s2">need to bear the weight of all your</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.750" end="01:00:25.220" style="s2">transgressions it&#39;s like Jesus really</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.570" end="01:00:27.500" style="s2">with no mercy that&#39;s how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.220" end="01:00:29.870" style="s2">play this who could tolerate that and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.500" end="01:00:31.370" style="s2">the Catholics at least say well look</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.870" end="01:00:33.710" style="s2">you&#39;re fallible you&#39;re gonna make all</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.370" end="01:00:36.620" style="s2">sorts of mistakes it&#39;s gonna happen over</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.710" end="01:00:38.540" style="s2">and over at least and go in and have the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.620" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">burden lifted from you time to time</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.540" end="01:00:41.180" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to play it straight</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:43.700" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to go in and actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.180" end="01:00:44.690" style="s2">confess and repent and and try to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.700" end="01:00:47.030" style="s2">better in the future</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.690" end="01:00:49.490" style="s2">but at least you don&#39;t have to drag your</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.030" end="01:00:51.820" style="s2">catastrophic cell past itself along with</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.490" end="01:00:55.510" style="s2">you every step of the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.820" end="01:00:58.100" style="s2">so anyways I&#39;m not trying to elevate</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.510" end="01:01:00.650" style="s2">human beings to the status of demigods</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.100" end="01:01:03.020" style="s2">you know but I guess I am suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.650" end="01:01:05.600" style="s2">that we could at least participate in</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.020" end="01:01:08.630" style="s2">that to the degree that we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.600" end="01:01:10.700" style="s2">hoist our own burdens and I do think we</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.630" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">should do that with humility and without</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.700" end="01:01:16.790" style="s2">thinking that we can see the way forward</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:20.510" style="s2">so clearly I do think we can walk away</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.790" end="01:01:21.020" style="s2">from Auschwitz though yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.510" end="01:01:26.780" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.020" end="01:01:29.600" style="s2">I would also I know this was this has</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.780" end="01:01:31.610" style="s2">been a recurring question for you and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.600" end="01:01:38.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if I asked me the last time</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.610" end="01:01:41.090" style="s2">really but it&#39;s about truth and how you</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.480" end="01:01:43.100" style="s2">return to that Christian</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.090" end="01:01:45.590" style="s2">some parts of Christianity at least has</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.100" end="01:01:48.490" style="s2">been true you said like that the truth</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.590" end="01:01:51.740" style="s2">for the individual I think you said and</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.490" end="01:01:57.980" style="s2">how my question is how can</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.740" end="01:02:01.160" style="s2">how can this be true and and for 4cs</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.980" end="01:02:03.590" style="s2">lewis when he when he&#39;s not like accept</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.160" end="01:02:08.119" style="s2">that that christianity was true for him</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.590" end="01:02:10.610" style="s2">it was like a mixture he was talked into</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.119" end="01:02:11.510" style="s2">it by talking and I don&#39;t remember that</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.610" end="01:02:14.660" style="s2">a guy&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.510" end="01:02:18.860" style="s2">but another friend and he said I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.660" end="01:02:21.770" style="s2">the combination of the myth of a dying</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.860" end="01:02:26.900" style="s2">God he always loved the dying gods like</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.770" end="01:02:29.510" style="s2">Dionysus under and Paul Durand but but</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.900" end="01:02:31.940" style="s2">but in Christ it can be combining that</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.510" end="01:02:34.580" style="s2">the dying God motif and the myth with an</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.940" end="01:02:36.890" style="s2">actual historical figure yeah he</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.580" end="01:02:39.850" style="s2">actually said that this is a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.890" end="01:02:43.580" style="s2">just a myth it&#39;s a true belief it&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.850" end="01:02:45.830" style="s2">because it&#39;s also historical and then he</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.580" end="01:02:47.869" style="s2">said that and I mean distinguished like</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.830" end="01:02:50.660" style="s2">if you if you watch from the outside and</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.869" end="01:02:54.740" style="s2">analyze it well of course you can see</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.660" end="01:02:57.950" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s just you can see the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.740" end="01:03:01.700" style="s2">similarities and as a scientist but from</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.950" end="01:03:05.150" style="s2">the inside you can see the truth so that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.700" end="01:03:09.380" style="s2">was his view of it yeah well here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.150" end="01:03:10.940" style="s2">here&#39;s a strange possibility like one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.380" end="01:03:12.380" style="s2">the things that&#39;s happened to me as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.940" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">delved farther and farther into</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.380" end="01:03:16.940" style="s2">religious stories is that I&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:20.270" style="s2">continually that their depth is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.940" end="01:03:23.300" style="s2">inexhaustible and at some point it</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.270" end="01:03:25.400" style="s2">becomes less impossible that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.300" end="01:03:29.290" style="s2">true then it is impossible that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.400" end="01:03:32.600" style="s2">not true something like that now okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.290" end="01:03:36.070" style="s2">now I&#39;m not so there there there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.600" end="01:03:39.920" style="s2">there are truths in Genesis that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.070" end="01:03:41.900" style="s2">unfathomably deep now and I&#39;ve outlined</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.920" end="01:03:43.520" style="s2">them to the best of my ability in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.900" end="01:03:45.470" style="s2">biblical series that I did now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:48.530" style="s2">know how to reconcile those truths with</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.470" end="01:03:51.310" style="s2">with with cyant with the scientific view</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.530" end="01:03:54.500" style="s2">of the world that the the view the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.310" end="01:03:56.510" style="s2">fact that the universe is fourteen</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.500" end="01:03:59.350" style="s2">billion years old and that we&#39;ve crawled</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.510" end="01:04:01.550" style="s2">our way up from the sludge in the mud I</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.350" end="01:04:05.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know how those things coexist</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.550" end="01:04:07.090" style="s2">precisely I know that there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.380" end="01:04:09.460" style="s2">routes that guide behavior and there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.090" end="01:04:11.590" style="s2">truths that describe the material world</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.460" end="01:04:13.390" style="s2">but I certainly don&#39;t think that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.590" end="01:04:15.550" style="s2">truths that we have that describe the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.390" end="01:04:17.350" style="s2">material world are final truths because</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.550" end="01:04:19.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t think our materialist viewpoint</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.350" end="01:04:22.450" style="s2">is accurate it&#39;s accurate for some</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.330" end="01:04:25.690" style="s2">purposes obviously and I am a practicing</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.450" end="01:04:29.080" style="s2">scientist and an informed one I would</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.690" end="01:04:31.390" style="s2">say I don&#39;t believe that people act as</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.080" end="01:04:33.340" style="s2">if they confront a material reality I</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.390" end="01:04:34.930" style="s2">believe that people act as if they</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.340" end="01:04:37.270" style="s2">confront an infinite realm of</p>

<p begin="01:04:37.270" end="01:04:42.490" style="s2">and the other pole of which is hell and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.100" end="01:04:44.530" style="s2">I believe that we treat each other as if</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.490" end="01:04:47.170" style="s2">that&#39;s the world that we live in because</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.530" end="01:04:50.020" style="s2">we upbraid each other for not upholding</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.170" end="01:04:52.120" style="s2">our moral duty and we understand what</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.020" end="01:04:55.000" style="s2">that means and we upgrade ourselves for</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.120" end="01:04:57.340" style="s2">being less than we could and so we</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.000" end="01:04:59.380" style="s2">confront a world of potential and we</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.340" end="01:05:01.600" style="s2">don&#39;t have a good model for that and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.380" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">mythological descriptions describe the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.600" end="01:05:06.490" style="s2">human being as the eternal confronter of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:08.980" style="s2">a world of potential and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.490" end="01:05:10.990" style="s2">something about that that&#39;s accurate now</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.980" end="01:05:13.090" style="s2">with regards to this Christian story</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.990" end="01:05:15.940" style="s2">specifically I do think the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.090" end="01:05:17.980" style="s2">that eternal myth was made historically</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.940" end="01:05:20.680" style="s2">concrete is one of the things about</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.980" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">Christianity that&#39;s unutterably powerful</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.680" end="01:05:26.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the limits are but</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:28.750" style="s2">let&#39;s say that what you&#39;re called upon</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.590" end="01:05:31.960" style="s2">to do until in life is to open yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.750" end="01:05:35.200" style="s2">up to the tragedy of being completely to</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.960" end="01:05:37.360" style="s2">to accept it to welcome it even even to</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.200" end="01:05:40.510" style="s2">love it if you can do that and that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.360" end="01:05:42.970" style="s2">easy thing you watched Iraq being</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.510" end="01:05:44.950" style="s2">invaded there&#39;s no easy way of loving</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.970" end="01:05:48.640" style="s2">now there&#39;s no easy way of saying yes to</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.950" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">that but your job in some sense as a as</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.640" end="01:05:54.670" style="s2">a incarnated finite creature is to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:57.190" style="s2">yes to the possibilities of being in</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.670" end="01:05:59.290" style="s2">every possible way the question is well</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.190" end="01:06:00.790" style="s2">what&#39;s the upper limit to that like what</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.290" end="01:06:02.800" style="s2">are the transformations that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.790" end="01:06:05.140" style="s2">possible as a consequence of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.800" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">and the answer to that is we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.140" end="01:06:08.920" style="s2">the Christian story is in part an</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:12.250" style="s2">investigation of that so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.920" end="01:06:15.880" style="s2">willing to accept your if you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.250" end="01:06:18.850" style="s2">to accept the brutality of the mob the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.880" end="01:06:21.990" style="s2">betrayal of your friends the torch</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.850" end="01:06:24.820" style="s2">of your existence and your unjust death</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.990" end="01:06:28.900" style="s2">if you&#39;re willing to accept that and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.820" end="01:06:35.530" style="s2">welcome it what happens to you and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.900" end="01:06:42.580" style="s2">answer is try it and find out I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.530" end="01:06:44.350" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna pass on just that yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.580" end="01:06:46.330" style="s2">know when you when you were when you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.350" end="01:06:48.370" style="s2">decided to immerse yourself in what was</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.330" end="01:06:49.770" style="s2">happening in Iraq you know you could</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.370" end="01:06:56.980" style="s2">have looked away</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.770" end="01:07:01.750" style="s2">yeah and for I often find that my my</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.980" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">role as a journalist or I&#39;m not a real</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.750" end="01:07:05.650" style="s2">journalist I&#39;m more like in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:10.510" style="s2">I&#39;m an editorial writer but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.650" end="01:07:14.850" style="s2">a mist between me and some reality so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.510" end="01:07:18.280" style="s2">could I can I can do it as a take on my</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.850" end="01:07:21.340" style="s2">my jackets and then I watch the reality</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.280" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">through that lens so so it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.340" end="01:07:26.530" style="s2">shields me from from from some some of</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:29.830" style="s2">it yeah well that&#39;s the advantage having</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.530" end="01:07:32.470" style="s2">a well-developed persona from the Union</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.830" end="01:07:34.210" style="s2">perspective you know you put on an image</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.470" end="01:07:37.030" style="s2">like like Clark Kent</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.210" end="01:07:39.970" style="s2">like Superman puts on Clark Kent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.030" end="01:07:42.520" style="s2">why superheroes always have an enormity</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.970" end="01:07:44.500" style="s2">of alter ego right they have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.520" end="01:07:46.750" style="s2">to live in the normal world right so you</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.500" end="01:07:50.310" style="s2">need to have an element of yourself that</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.750" end="01:07:50.310" style="s2">can that can exist</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.779" end="01:07:54.140" style="s2">that can act as a mask between you and</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.759" end="01:07:56.929" style="s2">the world I suppose that&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.140" end="01:07:59.809" style="s2">persona is so but I mean to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.929" end="01:08:02.390" style="s2">that you&#39;re able to open your eyes you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.809" end="01:08:04.219" style="s2">know [ __ ] Nietzsche also said you could</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.390" end="01:08:06.589" style="s2">determine the depth of a man&#39;s character</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.219" end="01:08:11.059" style="s2">by observing how much truth he&#39;s willing</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.589" end="01:08:13.269" style="s2">to tolerate mm-hmm right right which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.059" end="01:08:15.529" style="s2">you know you think well how can that be</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.269" end="01:08:17.389" style="s2">associated with the idea of the truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.529" end="01:08:18.980" style="s2">will set you free it&#39;s like well it</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.389" end="01:08:20.539" style="s2">might set you free but it will take you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.980" end="01:08:29.809" style="s2">places you&#39;re not sure you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.539" end="01:08:31.880" style="s2">first yeah sort of cliche in the movie</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.809" end="01:08:35.809" style="s2">matrix when neo wakes up and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.880" end="01:08:38.659" style="s2">flushed down like a drainpipe and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.809" end="01:08:40.339" style="s2">they woken up into this awful awful</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.659" end="01:08:43.339" style="s2">world and that&#39;s reality</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.339" end="01:08:46.569" style="s2">that&#39;s the truth that&#39;s the underworld</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.339" end="01:08:51.289" style="s2">you have this but it&#39;s an awful truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.569" end="01:08:53.329" style="s2">this that&#39;s really bleak but hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.289" end="01:08:55.639" style="s2">the truth is not that bleak all the time</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.329" end="01:08:57.679" style="s2">yeah well you know there&#39;s an old well</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.639" end="01:08:59.569" style="s2">the funny thing is there&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.679" end="01:09:01.609" style="s2">Christian idea too that when Christ was</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.569" end="01:09:03.559" style="s2">crucified he went and Herald hell before</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.609" end="01:09:06.020" style="s2">he rose to heaven it&#39;s like there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.559" end="01:09:08.270" style="s2">this idea that you don&#39;t go up without</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.020" end="01:09:11.559" style="s2">going down and I really do believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.270" end="01:09:14.179" style="s2">that&#39;s true and I think that maybe see</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.559" end="01:09:15.859" style="s2">one of the images in Genesis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.179" end="01:09:18.039" style="s2">really hard to understand is that when</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.859" end="01:09:21.409" style="s2">God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.039" end="01:09:24.349" style="s2">he puts an angel at the gates of</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.409" end="01:09:26.329" style="s2">paradise with with flaming swords to bar</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.349" end="01:09:29.539" style="s2">the way you might think well why would</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.329" end="01:09:32.569" style="s2">God bar the way to paradise with with</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.539" end="01:09:34.549" style="s2">flaming swords and maybe the flaming</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.569" end="01:09:36.619" style="s2">swords cut all the dead wood off before</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.549" end="01:09:38.179" style="s2">you step through the gate and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.619" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">all Deadwood then there&#39;s nothing left</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.179" end="01:09:42.619" style="s2">of you once the flaming swords are done</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:45.109" style="s2">with you and to observe what you observe</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.619" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">with the Iraq invasion that&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.109" end="01:09:48.529" style="s2">flaming swords you know because what</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:51.409" style="s2">you&#39;re watching is what human beings are</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.529" end="01:09:53.420" style="s2">like and you happen to be one and to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.409" end="01:09:56.599" style="s2">degree that you&#39;re like that that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.420" end="01:09:58.369" style="s2">doing that that&#39;s a hell of a thing -</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.599" end="01:10:00.409" style="s2">that&#39;s a hell of a thing to realize you</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.369" end="01:10:02.449" style="s2">think well what&#39;s the right response to</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.409" end="01:10:04.520" style="s2">watching that and I would say to stop</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.449" end="01:10:08.120" style="s2">being an evil person</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.520" end="01:10:10.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s no simple thing one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.120" end="01:10:14.660" style="s2">things with these people that goes there</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.550" end="01:10:15.950" style="s2">and joins the Islamic state is that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.660" end="01:10:20.930" style="s2">are not all evil</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.950" end="01:10:22.970" style="s2">they are just none of them are evil of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.930" end="01:10:25.220" style="s2">course and they&#39;re Psychopaths and they</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.970" end="01:10:27.290" style="s2">are and I mean if you are a psychopath</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.220" end="01:10:29.720" style="s2">they really want to do violence and</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.290" end="01:10:32.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a great place to be and you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.720" end="01:10:34.310" style="s2">probably do great there but there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.030" end="01:10:37.580" style="s2">also people joining there are they are</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.310" end="01:10:38.960" style="s2">really they want to do good they just</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.580" end="01:10:42.530" style="s2">really shouldn&#39;t have a really twisted</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.960" end="01:10:45.230" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s good and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.530" end="01:10:47.420" style="s2">the most depressing things about Islamic</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.230" end="01:10:51.620" style="s2">state is that some of the people that</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.420" end="01:10:54.500" style="s2">goes there they do horrible things and</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.620" end="01:10:57.920" style="s2">then they regret themselves but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.500" end="01:11:00.530" style="s2">how could you let them back into society</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.920" end="01:11:03.830" style="s2">after what they&#39;ve done yeah well how</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.530" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">can they let themselves back yeah so so</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.830" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">we say the power of ideas is that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:15.310" style="s2">can you can convert people that under</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:15.310" style="s2">other circumstances would have done good</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.940" end="01:11:23.030" style="s2">or evil instead well this is partly why</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.820" end="01:11:25.550" style="s2">I tried in some sense or I allowed in</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.030" end="01:11:28.220" style="s2">some sense 12 rules and my lectures as</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.550" end="01:11:29.930" style="s2">well to be so harsh because imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.220" end="01:11:32.750" style="s2">there are many young men who are looking</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.930" end="01:11:36.020" style="s2">for an adventure they need an adventure</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.750" end="01:11:38.450" style="s2">right they need an adventure and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.020" end="01:11:40.870" style="s2">their normative life is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.450" end="01:11:43.450" style="s2">soft and undemanding so that they could</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.870" end="01:11:45.920" style="s2">recede into a kind of domestic</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.450" end="01:11:47.930" style="s2">unconsciousness as an alternative but</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.920" end="01:11:51.460" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in that except a</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.930" end="01:11:54.230" style="s2">prolonged prolonged non-existence</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.410" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">way of calling people to an adventure</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.450" end="01:14:46.170" style="s2">that perhaps isn&#39;t destructive they have</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:48.390" style="s2">enough right in front of them to have a</p>

<p begin="01:14:53.430" end="01:14:57.540" style="s2">maybe that adventures right in front of</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.530" end="01:14:59.550" style="s2">us maybe that&#39;s part of maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.540" end="01:15:05.340" style="s2">part of the process of engendering</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.550" end="01:15:08.250" style="s2">paradise to find the adventure in in to</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.340" end="01:15:10.710" style="s2">find the proper divide don&#39;t excuse me</p>

<p begin="01:15:16.170" end="01:15:21.570" style="s2">in Christianity - right it&#39;s to make the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.239" end="01:15:26.430" style="s2">archetype real yeah I think we&#39;ll so the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.570" end="01:15:28.380" style="s2">rule number six set your house in</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.430" end="01:15:33.090" style="s2">perfect order before you criticize the</p>

<p begin="01:15:33.090" end="01:15:39.090" style="s2">begin with yourself and you you start to</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.670" end="01:15:45.780" style="s2">be be the change so to speak and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.090" end="01:15:48.719" style="s2">a way out of being bitter against the</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.780" end="01:15:50.040" style="s2">world to at least not to begin with at</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:52.640" style="s2">least it&#39;s just that&#39;s right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.040" end="01:15:55.400" style="s2">start you can say to yourself look</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.640" end="01:15:59.340" style="s2">everything looks pretty terrible to me</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.400" end="01:16:00.870" style="s2">what the hell how can it be this way but</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.340" end="01:16:03.680" style="s2">then you can take the next step and say</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.870" end="01:16:06.390" style="s2">yeah maybe I&#39;m not everything I could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.680" end="01:16:08.610" style="s2">so how about if I try to be everything I</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.390" end="01:16:12.030" style="s2">could be and then think about it again</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.610" end="01:16:13.950" style="s2">later yeah and that&#39;s the right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.030" end="01:16:16.050" style="s2">because the alternative to that is just</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.950" end="01:16:19.080" style="s2">a catastrophe right yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.050" end="01:16:22.710" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the key to dignity really</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.080" end="01:16:24.570" style="s2">right you you can be dignified even if</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.710" end="01:16:26.520" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not the best</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.570" end="01:16:29.280" style="s2">you&#39;re not strong if you&#39;re not the most</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.520" end="01:16:31.950" style="s2">beautiful but if you if you set yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.280" end="01:16:33.660" style="s2">in order and you take yourself seriously</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.950" end="01:16:35.880" style="s2">then you can have dignity and other</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.660" end="01:16:37.140" style="s2">other people notice it and you will</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.880" end="01:16:39.570" style="s2">notice it yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.140" end="01:16:42.420" style="s2">great that&#39;s a great place to start from</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.570" end="01:16:44.550" style="s2">and to strive for really that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.420" end="01:16:46.370" style="s2">the most one of the best</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.550" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">things about your book really that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.370" end="01:16:52.950" style="s2">bring dignity into I think you bring</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:55.380" style="s2">dignity into people&#39;s lives with this</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.950" end="01:16:57.420" style="s2">book on with your lectures but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.380" end="01:17:00.720" style="s2">what one of the takeaways I had from</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.420" end="01:17:02.790" style="s2">speaking with people because at after</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.720" end="01:17:04.830" style="s2">the last interview why I did and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.790" end="01:17:06.840" style="s2">people read the piece say I wrote and</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.830" end="01:17:12.110" style="s2">then people a lot of people thank me for</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.840" end="01:17:14.880" style="s2">introducing you to them in Sweden and</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.110" end="01:17:17.820" style="s2">and then that&#39;s been one of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.880" end="01:17:23.220" style="s2">recurring themes like that but the thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.820" end="01:17:24.750" style="s2">feels so much stronger themselves I</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.220" end="01:17:27.510" style="s2">think that&#39;s a great that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.750" end="01:17:30.110" style="s2">observation I mean you know our society</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.510" end="01:17:32.910" style="s2">is weak because we think about happiness</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.110" end="01:17:34.770" style="s2">why don&#39;t we think about dignity why</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.910" end="01:17:36.810" style="s2">don&#39;t we think about nobility why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.770" end="01:17:38.760" style="s2">we think about truth and responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.810" end="01:17:41.190" style="s2">or beauty all of those things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.760" end="01:17:44.340" style="s2">they&#39;re much they&#39;re the values that</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.190" end="01:17:48.150" style="s2">sustain you through suffering happiness</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.340" end="01:17:52.110" style="s2">cannot do that not that happiness is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.150" end="01:17:54.870" style="s2">be to be what there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.110" end="01:17:56.010" style="s2">utility and contempt for happiness thank</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.870" end="01:18:00.030" style="s2">God if it comes</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.010" end="01:18:01.710" style="s2">but dignity I mean we can&#39;t even when is</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.030" end="01:18:05.310" style="s2">the last time you heard someone talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.710" end="01:18:09.510" style="s2">about that part of the public discourse</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.310" end="01:18:11.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s so crucial I think also</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.510" end="01:18:14.000" style="s2">happiness is more of a byproduct than an</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.910" end="01:18:17.190" style="s2">improvement</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.000" end="01:18:19.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not something you if you strive for</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.190" end="01:18:21.960" style="s2">it too much you won&#39;t get it do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.860" end="01:18:26.460" style="s2">your dignity your happiness happiness</p>

<p begin="01:18:26.460" end="01:18:31.440" style="s2">strive for dignity and truth sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.920" end="01:18:32.310" style="s2">you&#39;ll be rewarded with happiness Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.440" end="01:18:34.800" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:41.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not something you can conjure up</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.720" end="01:18:46.230" style="s2">on your own good luck trying yeah so I</p>
