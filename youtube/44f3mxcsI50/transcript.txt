 The Psychological Significance of the Story of the Bible Lecture 5 Cain and Abel——The Destruction of Ideals by Jordan B. Peterson
 I want to read something for you
 I received a lot of letters
 I forgot where this letter came from
 I have been to many different places last week
 And this letter comes from one of the places
 I'll read it to you
 I don't know what to think about this myself
 This should be written by a lady
 I can only guess this
 No address and name on it
 "This is not a question but a statement
 "Or more accurately maybe it's a revelation."
 "I attended an Ayahuasca ceremony last weekend
 "If you haven't heard of it,
 "This is a South American hallucinogenic herb"
 "Maybe some of you will disdain this
 "But Ayahuasca can bring you directly
 "The Prototype World of Being"
 "Those who try this drug should say that the first try
 "I will call Ayahuasui "she"
 "Because the spirit of this plant is absolutely feminine
 "And the encounter with Ayahuasca is
 "With the Mother Earth Goddess of Creation
 "The Void Encounter of the Source of Everything
 "It's the feminine equivalent of Logos."
 "Dr. Peterson
 "You appeared in my Ayahuasca illusion"
 This may be the reason why I am so tired recently
 "Dr. Peterson
 "You appeared in my Ayahuasca illusion
 "Then I asked her who Jordan Peterson is"
 "What is he doing?"
 I want to know this too
 "She answered clearly
 "『He is here to wake up and teach
 ""The Holy Way of Masculine on Earth""
 "So I am here to represent
 "The great mother is the goddess
 "And the holy feminine way, thank you sincerely
 "She has been eagerly looking forward to
 "The awakening of the masculine way merges into the divinity and serves it"
 You can’t get this kind of letter every day
 Actually, I receive one or two such letters every day
 When I read it, what I thought in my head was
 Of course this is a completely crazy analogy
 But as a psychotherapist
 One thing I learned is
 Tell the client what I think at this time
 I'm not thinking exactly
 That's not the same thing
 What comes to my mind is more like a dream
 It is spontaneous as imagined
 If you are thinking
 Then there will be an active ingredient, right
 I mean, God knows how we think
 But at least part of it is actively involved
 Jung thought it was
 Dialogue between conscious and unconscious mind
 It is a continuous conversation
 But when things suddenly come to your mind
 It's like walking into a room suddenly
 There is something in the room
 By the way
 This is also an inspiration I got from Jung
 He pointed out very correctly
 People are not really thinking
 But those thoughts are showing to them
 So you can extract these ideas
 And criticize them, etc.
 Instead of just assuming they are correct
 But people don’t usually do
 As long as an idea suddenly appears in their minds
 They will believe it
 Anyway, one thing I often do in psychotherapy is
 Tell people what's in my head
 why
 Because the person who talks to me like this
 Can receive an undisturbed view
 This is not even an opinion but a reaction
 I think this is really not an opinion
 The point of view may be the result of my thinking
 It has a subjective meaning
 I suddenly thought of a story about Socrates
 He was
 At the trial for poisoning the youth of the whole country
 By the way, I have also been charged with the same crime
 But what I think is obvious is
 It’s not me who is doing the so-called poisoning
 So someone once asked the priestess of the Temple of Delphi
 The Temple of Delphi is equivalent to a place of retreat
 If you are an ancient Greek citizen
 You will have a dream when you go there
 Then you will go to the priestess of Delphi to interpret the dream
 No one really understands the priestess of Delphi today
 And her psionic principles
 Anyway, she can explain your dream
 Someone once asked her who is the wisest person in Greece
 Delphi priestess said it was Socrates
 Because he knows he doesn't understand anything
 This story is probably like this
 This story appeared in my mind at the time
 It's crazy to compare myself to Socrates
 But my mind is already wild
 So I can accept this result
 Now i have to do something
 I haven't done this before
 I want to read you a little
 I mentioned before that I finished my book last week
 I haven't read it to anyone
 I only shared with a few friends and asked them to proofread
 Here is a special mention of someone
 A screenwriter named Greg Herwitz
 His help to me is immense
 He is efficient and accurate in this type of work
 If I send him a 20-page manuscript
 He will edit the article drastically
 And send it back to me within 90 minutes
 It's incredible
 He is really good at this job
 Helped me a lot
 But no one has read these manuscripts except my editor
 I haven't read it to anyone
 But some of them seem to be particularly suitable for tonight’s lecture
 So I think tonight’s lecture will start with these articles
 Taken from the chapter on sacrifice
 This is about Abraham and Isaac
 It’s a very strange Old Testament story
 This kind of story contained in the Old Testament
 May make us modern people feel
 Maybe we should
 Keep your distance from the Old Testament
 Especially to the God in the Old Testament
 Stay away
 For Abraham
 God originally wanted him to sacrifice his son
 It turns out that God just made a joke with him
 I'm obviously shivering when I say this
 But this does raise a question
 What do you think of a god who would make such a request
 Or vice versa
 What do you think of Abraham, a man with similar hallucinations
 In any case, the credibility of this story in the eyes of modern people
 And the moral integrity of the Old Testament.
 These are some very bizarre stories
 They often deviate from the appearance or are consistent
 They have far-reaching connotations than appearances
 Tonight we will talk a lot about sacrifice
 I always have my own ideas about sacrifice
 These thoughts are written in my book
 In "The Antidote to the Chaos of the Twelve Rules of Life"
 This book will be published in January I think I mentioned
 I am going to read the seventh rule
 "Go for something meaningful
 The paragraph in "not short-term benefits"
 This is what I have in the past three years
 Some articles on the subject of sacrifice
 Before reading this article, let me briefly introduce
 It took me a long time to understand
 The meaning of sacrifice in the Old Testament is strange
 But when I understand
 The meaning seems to become obvious
 It's the kind of feeling that suddenly realized
 Because many times if you understand something correctly
 As long as you understand it correctly it will be obvious
 Then let's try it together
 This method seems to work for me anyway
 I used to just vaguely understand
 Modern usage of the concept of sacrifice
 Everyone actually understands the subject
 If you want to make things better in the future
 Then you have to make sacrifices now
 Even your family needs to do this for generations
 Especially when you are a good parent
 I think immigration is a typical example, right
 Immigrants often come from bad places
 If they want to join a new community that is hostile to them
 Often have to pay a huge price
 They will have a hard life
 They do this mainly to make their lives
 And their children’s lives become better
 Fortunately when they arrived in Canada
 Compared to their hometown
 Life really got better
 The place where they came is worse but here is relatively better
 Even so
 Immigrants still need to work hard
 To regain a foothold
 They must learn a new language
 Embrace the influence of new culture
 And face the fact that they are not part of the mainstream culture
 Anyway, you should all have heard of such stories
 So you make sacrifices for the future
 The idea of ​​making sacrifices for your children
 Everyone can understand this
 This is a sign of responsible maturity
 It’s the performance of correctly shouldering the burden of life
 If you discipline yourself, you will do it
 In fact, this is almost the definition of self-discipline
 Self-discipline means you have the ability to make sacrifices
 If you just do what you want to do more
 You don’t have self-discipline instead of what you focus on
 That's not self-discipline
 If it works then that works
 If you mix well in that way, that's fine
 But this is still not self-discipline
 Self-discipline is when you want to do something right away
 You will think "No, I have to delay my desire first"
 Maybe a permanent delay
 Or at least in the medium to long term
 You focus on what you think
 Things that will produce results in the medium to long term
 You look ahead and decide
 Less satisfy today's impulse
 You will make your future more reliable
 More fruitful
 And you really did it
 But it is not easy
 Last week we discussed
 Adam and Eve's discovery of the future
 And reveal the possibilities of the future
 This includes the possibility of future tragedy and suffering
 Is what we might
 Recognition of the tragedy and suffering
 Prompt us to make the sacrifice of the moment
 Prompt us to make the sacrifice of the moment
 So that we can reduce unnecessary anxiety
 Uncertainty and pain
 Admittedly this is a negative view
 But we can also do this for some happiness
 To make life better and so on
 This is not a trivial matter
 But the most fundamental problem is
 Especially when you have a baby
 The most fundamental problem is to avoid pain, right
 Everyone thinks so
 This is your first moral obligation
 If you can at least recognize reality
 This is your most important duty
 So you will make the necessary sacrifices
 To create the future
 The theme of sacrifice is found in the Old Testament
 But it's so real
 So that it is difficult to compare between the two
 It is not obvious to me that they are consistent
 I don’t remember when I went to United Church when I was a child
 During the very limited religious education
 I always went to the United Church until I was 13
 I don't remember anyone explained to me
 The sacrifice of Cain and Abel
 Or Abraham's attempted sacrifice
 Or is it the sacrifice of people to God
 Is a dramatic sign, it heralds sacrifice
 Will become a psychological concept recognized by modern civilization
 This is obvious as I said before
 Once you put things in perspective, it will suddenly become clear
 No one explained these things to me
 I'd better read the book
 I just finished introducing this matter
 "With the development of mankind, these things happened
 "First of all, before written history and drama
 "That tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years
 "Delay and exchange behaviors began to emerge
 "And this process is slow and painful."
 There is a cool psychology study
 This is called the "marshmallow test"
 Is it a reliable study?
 Although it was done by social psychologists
 This experiment should be reproducible
 Is a good study
 You choose some kids
 Take to a room
 Then put what they want in front of them
 Like a marshmallow
 Then you basically start to "torture" them
 You said, "Did you see that cotton candy?"
 The child will think "Yes, I saw cotton candy"
 You say, "You can eat marshmallows now
 "Or if you wait a minute"
 I remember the experiment stipulated ten minutes
 "You can eat two marshmallows."
 This presents a problem for the children
 They are required to use
 An actual concrete tangible marshmallow
 To exchange two imaginary future marshmallows
 Imagine the reality of a hypothetical future
 And the reality in front of you
 Has the same tangible meaning
 Not an easy task
 It's amazing that people can do this
 Then the experimenter left
 Some kids grab the marshmallow and eat it
 There are some children, they recorded the children
 The children began to show different reactions after they left
 They whistled and looked at the ceiling
 Sitting on one's hands
 They try to distract themselves
 Of course they will stare at the marshmallows from time to time
 Like a squirrel staring at a nut
 They will try to restrain themselves
 This reminds me of the child’s prefrontal cortex
 This higher cortical system
 Is at war with the underlying motivation system
 Those who control things like hunger
 More primitive motivation system
 Hunger system hypothalamic system
 Would say, "There are some high-fat and high-sugar things right in front of me
 "Act now
 "Grab that thing and put it in your mouth."
 I believe many of you often
 Because whether to eat something high in fat and sugar
 And fight with the hypothalamus
 And often lose
 So you may be able to see the situation of those children firsthand
 The hypothalamus has very powerful tendrils
 Implant the brain deeply
 Enter the part that is mainly responsible for our autonomous control
 The autonomous control center has some small weak ribbons
 Downward control of the hypothalamus
 If you know something about neuroanatomy
 Can easily understand that at the critical moment
 Which part is controlling
 For children to learn to control
 Those underlying primitive impulses are not easy
 These impulses are born
 We share with animals
 But the kids will control and it’s cool
 This was discovered by Walter Michel
 Is the research he did
 He found that for those in the marshmallow test
 For children who can postpone satisfaction
 Their long-term human generation is better than those
 Children who ate marshmallows impulsively and immediately had much more positive results
 This is "delayed gratification"
 This is probably related to responsibility
 Although this specific connection has not yet been determined
 But they look very similar in concept
 Anyway, this situation may occur in
 It’s almost like this for two to four year olds
 They should be prepared before the age of four
 Because for them
 Learn not to delay gratification
 It’s difficult to interact well with other children
 If you can't delay gratification
 No other kids will like you
 Because you will be arbitrary
 You need to be satisfied immediately
 And you lose your temper easily
 In short you don't have
 Self-control to get along with others happily
 You can see this in children, it's funny
 Not only that when the behavior of satisfying the delay first appears
 It heralds positive long-term results
 By the way, the responsibility trait has the same effect
 In western culture
 Responsibility is the second major factor for long-term success
 It is second only to intelligence
 In our society
 Those who have done the best in all periods
 Those who work hard with high IQ
 I want to say I think this phenomenon is pretty good
 how to say
 It's an illustration
 It can prove that our culture is positive
 I think you need
 If this system is truly elite-led
 And it should be so
 And you want to learn from people who are more effective in contributing
 If you get resources there
 Then what you want to happen is
 Let those who work hard and smart have a better life
 Everyone can live better because of this
 I hope so
 anyway
 You can see the ability to delay gratification
 Is developed in the children
 "At first before written history and drama appeared
 "Humanity has more than 100,000 years of history."
 "Delay and exchange the twin behaviors
 "Begin to appear slowly and painfully"
 "Then they are expressed in a metaphysical abstract form
 "Such as rituals and sacrificial legends"
 "Like there is a powerful character in the sky judging you
 "You better please him or be cautious in your words and deeds."
 "We have been observing ourselves for a long time with God."
 "When you give up what you treasure
 "He seems to be happy"
 "So practice sharing and sacrifice
 "Until you know it."
 "No one really said this."
 It’s been a long time, even if someone said something similar
 "But these views are implicit in the action
 "Hidden in the story"
 "Action first, implicit first"
 "People observe these successes and failures
 "It's been thousands of years."
 "We think twice and come to a conclusion
 "Successful among us will make sacrifices
 "Successful among us will delay enjoyment
 "Successful among us will play against the future"
 "A great idea"
 "Gradually formed in an unprecedented form."
 "The idea is the key to a long and profound story."
 "It is the moral of this story."
 I want to make a foreshadowing here
 "What is the difference between successful and unsuccessful"
 "Successful people will make sacrifices
 "After they make sacrifices, things will get better."
 "The problem has become more precise but also broader."
 "What is for the greatest good
 "The greatest sacrifice ever made."
 If you ask for this purpose
 Maybe there will be a moment
 You can’t make it more precise and broad
 At this moment this question is in a sense
 Or maybe even the answer to that question
 Became a prototype
 Become a prototype because it can no longer be optimized
 In a sense it seems to be the ultimate problem
 How could it be possible to ask a broader question?
 Assumed initial preset
 You have to make sacrifices
 Then the logical end point will look like this
 Good you have to make sacrifices
 That for the greatest good
 And what is the greatest sacrifice made
 This is a good question
 "The answer will become profound."
 "God in the traditional sense of the West
 "Similar to other gods that require sacrifice."
 "We have explored the reason."
 "But sometimes God’s requirements are even higher
 "High enough to require you to sacrifice your favorite."
 "That's why"
 "It's also another major human discovery."
 "Sometimes things don't go well"
 "It's obvious and ordinary."
 "But there is a contradiction."
 "Sometimes when things get blocked
 "The obstacle to this matter happens to be the most cherished thing."
 "Why because the world is
 "Shown with your values ​​as a template"
 "If the world you see is not what you want
 "At this time you should reflect on your values."
 "It's time to pull yourself out of the current assumptions."
 I believe that in this lecture series
 I have mentioned a famous experiment many times
 The "Invisible Gorilla" experiment
 In the "Invisible Gorilla" experiment, there are two teams of players
 Three members per team
 A team in black and a team in white
 Each team passes each other within the team
 And it's all around
 You can watch videos of their experiments
 They almost filled the whole shot
 The white team passes the ball to the white team member
 The black team passes the ball to the black team member
 Your task for this experiment
 Is clear
 Number of passes of black team members
 This is what you want
 At this time you have to pursue goals and values
 Pursuing goals and values ​​at this time are the same thing
 Is to complete this task
 This is very cool very cool
 This fact is incredible
 Like a complete verification of an element in the Buddhist worldview
 They pass the ball
 The experimenter asked you how many times
 You said 15 times that you are happy
 Because you are focused
 The experimenter said it was good
 Maybe it’s not that you may have missed one
 Then the experimenter will say
 So did you see that gorilla
 Half of the people would say
 What gorilla is kidding
 The experimenter said, "Yes." He rewinds and replays
 About half of the three-minute video
 There is indeed a man who is 1.9 meters tall
 Walked into the camera in a gorilla suit
 He stands in the middle of the playing field
 Almost as tall as other players
 Extremely eye-catching and unobtrusive
 He beat his chest for about a second and a half
 Then he swaggered down
 At that time, half of the people did not see this gorilla
 This is really shocking
 It illustrates your quest
 Will make you invisible to the essence of reality
 Your pursuit will give you an insight into some of the reality
 And ignore most of the rest of the reality
 This is normal
 Because you can't
 In a sense most of you can’t
 You are a very focused creature like a laser beam
 So I can’t pay attention to everything all the time
 But once you realize a problem you will ask yourself
 If you feel miserable then there is a possibility
 That is, you may be too focused on one point
 So that your focus may be entirely around
 "Why are things so bad?" The question comes up
 But it may not be
 Because life is so random
 You will suffer even when you don’t deserve it
 This looks like a story from "Job"
 Job is a good man but God made a bet with Satan
 This seems to be another vicious act
 Torture Job
 Satan did a great job
 I want to see if Job will disobey God
 This seems to be very interesting to God
 But the point is that even in the Old Testament
 There are also ample signs
 Sometimes people are devastated and bruised
 Even if they have good conduct and high ambitions
 Life is still a bit random
 What may hurt you is what you are attached to
 It may even be the thing you are most attached to
 Will hurt you the most
 This is most likely the person you love
 Many times when I give people a psychological diagnosis and treatment
 They suffer for some reason
 Sometimes just because of a bad relationship with close family members
 In short, their family members
 I don’t really want to lead them to a good life
 Instead, these family members
 But want to bring them in
 In the most tragic situation possible
 And maliciously use kinship to fulfill their wishes
 So sometimes necessary sacrifice
 Not only to keep a physical distance from that person
 And sometimes seriously alienating those people
 Such as old and dead
 It's really hard and painful
 But this is also a very good example
 It shows that sometimes in order to never fall into
 Withdraw from pain and chaos
 You must give up your beloved
 "If the world you see is not what you want
 "Then you need to reflect on your own values."
 I need to think about it
 Because its other option is to curse fate
 If it's not your problem, you can't change
 Because you didn't do anything wrong
 Then the problem lies with Destiny World and others
 The reason is that these are all parts of the world
 In other words, the problem lies in the nature of the world itself
 Or the problem lies in "God" itself
 This god can be any god you believe or not
 Because no matter what kind of faith you have
 Will encounter the situation I described
 There is a very interesting thing
 I mentioned before about the Israelites in the Old Testament
 They understand this is not trivial
 In the Old Testament the Israelites over and over again
 The magic of being complacent
 Immediately afterwards committed a moral error
 Because they are proud and complacent
 Then God split them to pieces
 Cycle after generation
 They got up tremblingly
 But has always maintained the same attitude
 "We made a mistake, we made a mistake."
 This leads to an axiom instead of observation
 That is, "If things are not shown as they are
 "Then we should not curse God
 "I should reflect on myself"
 You will ask why not curse God
 Because it might also be his fault
 This is a good question
 I have been thinking about this problem for 30 years
 Why not curse god
 Because existence is arbitrary
 Moreover, we are fragile and unbearable
 This is all the problem right
 There are unjust, unfair and endless suffering in the world
 Why not blame God for all this
 Regardless of whether God exists
 This has nothing to do with the metaphysical elements on this issue
 The conclusion remains the same regardless of whether God exists
 I can say the answer is still
 "If you don’t want to take responsibility
 "Trying to give responsibility to society or beings themselves
 "That is to make things worse and worse."
 "Not only to you but to everyone
 "It may even be to the being itself."
 It's useless
 If you think it's your problem
 The problem is with you
 Maybe this is not true at all
 Maybe you are the one tortured by God and Satan
 If this is the case, you are unlucky
 But this is still applicable to a human being
 People need to stand on their own feet
 Have the courage to take responsibility
 No matter how opposed
 This is really amazing
 "It's time to pull yourself out of the current assumptions."
 I see it as a "rotten wood problem"
 Think about the subject of Phoenix
 I remember when Harry Potter went to war
 Like a saint george going to war
 What's that thing called
 Basilisk, your eyes will be turned into stone as long as you touch him
 This is the dragon for all intents and purposes
 It's watching the virgin
 What's her name? It's not "Virginia"
 But is it called "Ginny" that is closer?
 A variant of the word "Ginny Fla" and "Virgin"
 It is also a variant of the word "Virginia"
 When Harry Potter was bitten and poisoned by this dragon
 This is the dragon of chaos right
 When you look at this dragon, it will petrify
 When he was bitten and dying
 Also if you are bitten by something
 If it turns into stone at a glance
 If you're not dead, you're better than dead
 This is one of two things
 Then the phoenix flew in
 It poured tears into the wound and healed him
 Phoenix this creature
 You can let the deadwood burn out every now and then
 I think the phoenix is ​​reborn every 100 years
 Of course it's very dramatic
 This bird needs to nirvana in flames
 Then there is only one egg left
 But there is also a very serious message
 In a sense you can compare yourself to a forest
 The forest burns every now and then to clean up the dead wood
 Only in this way can the forest stay long
 If you don’t let the forest burn for a long time,
 Like it happened in the U.S.
 Especially when their forest fire control is too strict
 The result is a large accumulation of deadwood
 Accumulate less and more
 Until the whole forest is covered with deadwood
 Then he was struck by lightning
 Finally turned into a piece of scorched earth
 This is a valuable moral lesson
 That is, don’t wait for too much deadwood to pile up before burning
 Maybe let the forest burn itself a small amount every day
 It’s only burned once more than 20 years.
 In the end, there is nothing left
 Because maybe this will leave you with nothing
 But things often happen to people
 Commonplace
 The deadwood accumulates and it will be a mess around it
 Unresolved chaos will add up
 One day a spark will appear
 The power of a prairie prairie can be described as devastating
 By then it will be too late
 They are the ones eaten by dragons
 Was swallowed into the dragon's belly
 This is another common prototype theme
 Or there will be a hero to save them
 Or they will stay in their belly
 This is the sign of "hell"
 I don't recommend doing this
 So prevent the slightest failure
 Much better than sporadic unexpected changes
 "It's time to pull yourself out of the current assumptions."
 One more thing
 Solzhenitsyn said when he wrote about the Soviet Union and its morbidity
 "When its pathological totalitarianism reached its peak
 "It is illegal to complain about your bad life."
 You think about how scary this is
 Because it’s not good enough
 And I’m not referring to casual situations
 I'm talking about, for example, you have diabetes
 Facing a serious situation like amputation
 This is not a trivial matter
 This is a disaster
 For another example, you may be unemployed at the economic level
 But you see what the Soviet Union did
 "We already have the answer"
 "Everything is perfect"
 This is a totalitarian idea
 "If everything is perfect and you are suffering"
 "Then the problem may be with you."
 After all everything is perfect and you are suffering
 What should you do
 Stand up and say you are suffering
 Then you are proof that the facts are not perfect
 You are like the widower and orphan in the Old Testament story
 When the throne is high
 I don’t care about widowers and orphans
 Then the prophet came out and said
 "These widowers orphans are far more important than you think."
 "If you don’t give proper attention
 "Then things around you will
 "Fall apart in a way you didn't expect"
 You are like your own widower and orphan
 But you can't say
 See things are not perfect yet
 Because I still suffer here
 Then you can't admit that you are suffering
 If you don’t admit that you are suffering
 Pain especially excessive pain
 Should be seen as an evidence
 Prove that you did something wrong
 This should be regarded as proof that you have made a mistake
 There is a problem with something big you are doing
 I know it's hard
 It’s not that some people are suffering
 Suffering because they are doing something wrong with some simple methods
 I was in the elevator of the hospital once
 It's a terrible experience
 Came in alone
 Completely panicked
 It must be bad
 I forgot how to speak
 Anyway, I exchanged a few words with him
 He said he had just been diagnosed as
 Suspected advanced cancer
 The scary thing is that he began to look back on his life in the elevator
 I want to find out what evil he did to suffer this disaster
 He soon blamed this on his own moral corruption
 That was not what I meant
 You can't say to a person with cancer
 If you haven't lived so stupidly in your life
 You won't get cancer
 Believe me, things like this are more common than you think
 The severely ill person is blamed
 I didn't mean it
 That's not the case
 The more general attitude should be
 If life is still not satisfactory
 Then your first responsibility is to act on it
 Reflect on your mistakes and change the past
 This is absolutely true
 Because maybe you are doing unnecessary things
 Things will get better if you solve them
 "Let down
 "Sacrifice the present to create the future"
 "There is an old story about catching monkeys"
 Maybe someone here is interested in catching monkeys
 Now you have a chance to learn
 First you have to find a large narrow-necked jar
 The top diameter only needs to be enough for him to put the monkey paw in
 Then install half of the stone
 This way the monkey can't move
 Then get some food around the jar to attract its attention
 Then put some more food in the jar
 If you are lucky, the monkey will come
 It will grab the food
 Still want to eat what's in the jar
 I will stick my paw in to find
 If you trap well done
 It just can't pull it out
 Because it got food
 Now if the monkey doesn’t let go
 Don't give up
 One just needs to walk over and catch the monkey
 Monkeys don’t know how to sacrifice
 It's just a monkey
 Then you can catch it
 Because it can’t control hypothalamic desire
 If you want to be kind to monkeys
 Put sugar or something outside
 Monkeys can only eat sugar a few times
 Then it won't do everything like you do
 But you know what I mean
 "People can go to the jar and catch the monkey."
 "Animals will not give up parts for the whole"
 Is this a good conclusion?
 Animals will not give up parts for the whole
 "Maybe this story is a bit false
 "But a paranoid psychology professor once told me
 "'Fictions are used to deceive people in as real a way as possible.'"
 "If you give up valuable things, you can ensure future success."
 "Things of value can please God after being sacrificed"
 Both have the same meaning
 One of them is more clear
 I think it's the first
 The second one is more dramatic
 You might think the latter is more like
 Embedded in the dream of collective religion
 "What is the most valuable and worthy of sacrifice"
 Obviously it depends on culture and time
 "At least you can ask what is more iconic"
 Such as "the method of meat division"
 For example, if you are a herder
 Then this is the big event
 Generally speaking, looking at human history
 Meat is a valuable commodity
 In chimpanzees too
 Chimpanzees like to hunt colobus monkeys
 And basically eat live
 The colobus weighs about 18 kg
 Will keep screaming when eaten
 This is interesting
 One thing can be seen in male chimpanzees
 Refers to the male chimpanzees who go out hunting
 Males are not very restrained when hunting
 Or you can say that you are not very sympathetic
 Certain human behaviors are indeed reminiscent of this
 This kind of thing can often be seen on the human battlefield
 A group of people give up all internal regulations
 To a certain extent
 Make you wonder whether the internal regulations exist
 Just to get meat because meat is precious
 There is a good literature
 Books published not long ago
 It's about a book about humans inventing fire
 I said a little about this before
 Langham thinks we invented fire
 Mastered how to use fire approximately 2 to 3 million years ago
 This is much earlier than people thought
 This has truly transformed us physically
 From ancestors similar to chimpanzees
 Until now, this slender looks
 Cooked meat is better digested
 Meat is an important source of nutritional energy required by the human body
 Especially cooked meat
 So meat is important
 Cooked meat is important
 The same applies to the choice of meat
 The meat you will choose when you greet guests if you are not one
 I keep saying the word wrong
 Is it called vegan?
 Still called Vega (Vega)
 I always say Vega but I read it wrong
 Vega (Vega) is a star, right?
 Vegans are not star creatures
 You have to eat meat for the guests anyway
 Especially when guests come to visit your house
 And you are a herder
 Then you have to make some high-end meat
 Use the best part of the meat to entertain guests
 This is really important
 This is very meaningful and good livestock
 What's up
 Speaking of things you can sacrifice
 It can be your best livestock
 How about sacrificing yourself and your children
 In terms of hierarchy, children should be ranked behind
 This is a bit hard to accept right
 It’s like throwing a coin, hard to choose
 From the perspective of sacrifice, you are more precious
 Or your child is more precious
 I have to say as a parent
 Children are more precious
 Most people have established
 It’s hard to say "appropriate", but let’s just say so
 Established a suitable relationship with the child
 Parents will block bullets for their children in critical moments
 Let the child survive
 "Mother's sacrifice was Michelangelo
 "Deeply displayed in the form of the great sculpture "The Pieta""
 "The Virgin Mary stares at the crucified son"
 Jesus' body was nailed to the cross
 "It's her fault"
 "Through her, Jesus participated in the drama of beings."
 So what is the meaning of this sculpture
 This is a great work
 Incredible work
 You can't even believe
 Someone can create such a work
 This is not the only work by Michelangelo, right
 It’s not just that
 It seems that this is the period when he finished other incredible masterpieces
 I took a few months to make it by the way.
 This is a work about meditation
 So it is placed in the great cathedral of the great city
 This is a work about meditation
 The theme of this work is like saying
 What will she do if she wakes up as a mother
 A customer came to see me some time ago
 That's a lady about 30 years old
 Make personal decisions
 She is very professional, so I asked her
 Of course, her career development is also a little problematic
 I've seen this kind of thing many, many times
 This is a story and a hybrid
 I talked to her about other elements in her life
 There are only five things in life
 Career is gone
 What valuable things have you done outside of your career
 How is your family
 May be related to your native family
 Related to your biological siblings and so on
 Do you have a close relationship
 What are your plans for your family
 In addition to these five things
 There are other things like exercise from time to time
 Don’t eat too bad and stay away from crimes like drug abuse
 That kind of lazy life
 If you are missing any of these five things
 Maybe you did any of them wrong
 That's the trouble
 You can escape some trouble
 But can't hide everything
 She said so
 "I'm not sure if I want to have a baby"
 I think "Gosh"
 "Can you use your brain?"
 I told her "you are too old-fashioned"
 I said, "You should think about this when you are 16"
 I was thinking "Really, can you only do this?"
 This lady is very smart
 So I was thinking, "Really, can you only do this?"
 Of course there are bitterness and pain behind this
 If you ask 30 people who are hesitant to have children
 What are they hesitating
 Twenty of them will say, "If you say too much, it will be tears."
 You know how old this is
 This is too old-fashioned so it doesn't constitute an idea
 This is a cultural gene, it is rooted in your mind
 This is not an idea
 Of course you shouldn’t just look at the apparent value in this kind of thing
 Say "Uh, I don't want to start a family"
 If you still have a little review, you will also comment on the price
 There is a very common idea
 "There are too many people on Earth."
 I really don't like this view
 Who do you want to die
 How to let them die
 This is a serious question
 Who is saying there are too many people
 What is going on with these people
 "We are wandering around and ruining the earth"
 By the way, the Club of Rome had predicted
 There will be more people on Earth by the year 2000
 The point that led to a massive famine
 These people are really wrong
 I think it is the Club of Rome that sees us as
 Virus or cancer on earth
 Really? Is that how you treat humans?
 How can you do this
 Is it okay to treat humans as viruses and cancer?
 What would you do to viruses and cancer
 Invite them in and make them feel at home
 Of course you will destroy them
 You should examine your metaphor friends
 Because it was you who came up with these metaphors
 Or do they control your mind? It’s really not clear
 So it is better to pay attention to them
 Back to the topic
 Mary is the Virgin and the role of "mother"
 It doesn't matter whether she really exists
 At least it can be said that she exists in a surreal sense
 She exists as a Virgin
 What kind of sacrifice did the Virgin made?
 It's obvious
 If you are a qualified mother
 You will let your son be destroyed by the world
 This is what a mother should do
 This is bound to happen right
 He will be born and suffer
 Life is full of difficulties
 He will get sick
 Will experience failure and extinction
 Eventually die
 This is bound to happen
 If you are sober you realize this
 Then you say
 Maybe this is the way to survive
 Then you try to achieve these things
 That's why you are worthy of this statue
 But this is still a sacrifice made by the mother
 Is it right to bring children into this bad world
 Every woman asks herself this question
 Some women's answers are no
 They have their own reasons
 Mary feels right spontaneously
 Mary is the archetype of a woman willing to bring new life
 This is the meaning of this picture
 Not because she can't see
 She knows what will happen
 Mary is the archetype of a woman willing to bring new life
 She fully understands the meaning of life
 She is not naive
 She's not the kind to be stupid because of being drunk
 Woman accidentally pregnant in the back seat of a Chevrolet in 1957
 It's not like this
 She consciously
 Know clearly what will happen in the future
 And then allow these things to happen
 This is another thing that can prove mother's courage
 My mother is very good at this
 She is very friendly
 From the point of view of her personal interests, she is a bit too friendly
 But the character with high affinity will be like this
 Your affinity is so high that it hurts your own interests
 This is the definition of affinity
 She is a good person
 Fortunately she is also
 She is still alive and we are very close
 It's a good thing that I can always make her laugh
 But she is also an iron lady
 I remember one time she happened to ran into
 When I was young in the town where I grew up
 Playing in an empty baseball field
 I was about ten years old
 She passed here
 I am with a group of friends
 I am going to fight with this bear kid who often plays with
 Half of the team are girls
 Fighting may have something to do with state and skill
 Anyway, we are going to fight
 My mother passed by here
 She glanced here
 I can tell from her behavior
 She knows what is going to happen
 She glanced at me and walked away
 I thought to myself, "Wow mom did a great job."
 I really don't want her to come over at that moment
 Then said, "You kids are going to fight, right?"
 Isn't it obvious
 We are really ready to fight
 If you come to stop
 I lost before I started playing
 So I really have to give my mom a thumbs up
 She also said something before
 I had conflicts with my father when I was a teenager
 He and I have some conflicts
 We two are evenly matched
 Actually it should be 7 to 3
 I am the one with more problems
 I left home when I was 17
 She said something very interesting when I left home
 She said, "If you live well at home, you will never leave."
 I thought to myself, "Mom said so well"
 "For a person with high affinity
 "You really have a backbone."
 Really awesome
 "Mother" will also say
 "Go out and get frustrated."
 "Because you are strong enough to handle it."
 She doesn’t say, "You can just lie down in the bedroom."
 "Because the world is unfair, it didn't treat you well"
 "It made you suffer too much."
 Instead, she would say "The outside world is indeed full of suffering"
 "But you are stronger than you think."
 "Mary’s son Christ dedicated himself completely to God
 "In order to give him faith and trust in this world
 "It will not be broken by betrayal torture and death."
 "This is an example of a respectable person"
 This is an interesting behavior
 This is a mother who is willing to make sacrifices
 Laid the foundation for her son
 And this son is willing to make sacrifices
 This result is very good
 It's important to know this
 "But for Christ
 "When he sacrificed himself
 "God his Heavenly Father also sacrificed his own son at the same time."
 This is the strange thing about the Trinity model
 That God sacrificed himself to himself
 The same thing happened in Norse mythology, right
 Is it Norse mythology? It should be Zeus
 Germanic myth
 Zeus sacrificed himself to himself
 He hangs himself on the tree
 And really got hurt
 This is an interesting analogy
 But I think part of the meaning is
 Humans are trying to figure out
 What is the ultimate sacrifice
 Similar to the ultimate sacrifice of value
 Passion
 I said before that I was laying the groundwork
 I want to mention things that will not be discussed in the near future
 Maybe it won’t be mentioned in this series of lectures
 Because i don't know where i can talk
 The mother has a request for her to make the ultimate sacrifice
 There is also a demand for his son to make the final sacrifice
 There is also a request for his father to make the final sacrifice
 And at the same time
 This makes the ultimate sacrifice possible
 And suppose this sacrifice brings recovery
 This sacrifice brings recovery and salvation
 This is a thought-provoking idea
 It’s important
 I don't know if it is correct
 But I know its reverse is wrong
 Generally speaking, the wrong thing is right
 The opposite of this is wrong
 Because if the Virgin does not make sacrifices
 Your family will fall into a terrible Oedipus situation
 Or something like this
 This is very bad
 If you want to explore this
 I suggest you watch a documentary called "Kruper"
 It is called the best documentary ever by some critics
 This is really a good movie
 This is the only one I have seen
 A work that fully displays the Oedipus disaster
 You can have a look
 It's useless if the mother doesn't make sacrifices
 If the father doesn’t make sacrifices
 If the father is not willing to let his son go out
 Be betrayed
 Then there is no way to start
 Because the child won't grow up
 If my son is not willing to go out
 So who will bear the responsibility?
 If the sacrifice of the three parties did not happen
 Everything is chaotic, disorderly and hellish
 If all the sacrifices happen
 Is this the opposite of chaos
 you can say
 Depends on the degree of these sacrifices
 This is a continuous state
 How thorough can they happen
 We don't know
 You might say
 In the matter of "encourage your children to live in the truth"
 How well you can do
 This is a partial answer to this question
 The answer is probably that you can’t do your best to do it
 The result of this incident may be good
 But you won't know
 If you do this thing extremely well
 How good the result will be
 You won't know
 People have hidden it
 The interesting thing after having a baby is
 There are two things you don't know
 Actually there are more than two
 There are three things you will know after you have children
 The first is that you haven't grown up before
 You won’t grow up until you have someone more important than yourself
 You really don't
 People think they will grow up without children
 It’s just that they think so
 Some people make other sacrifices
 But in my opinion this is not the same
 This is not an elegant metaphor
 But you will find that not being the focus of other people’s attention is actually a relief
 It's good because you can relax
 Because of course your children are in the family and society
 Will immediately become the focus of attention
 You will let your child become the focus of attention
 Unless you are a narcissist
 Then you will find all kinds of shining points on others
 Others also like babies
 This is a good thing
 We lived in Montreal when we raised our first child
 The neighborhood we live in is not good by Montreal standards
 Montreal is as good as Toronto
 Even if it’s a slightly inferior neighborhood
 It also brings a little dark side in the charming
 There are also a few difficult people in the block
 The whole neighborhood is not very rich
 We will push her around
 These gloomy and frustrated old people will come over
 I became radiant when I saw her
 They will come over and smile at her
 You will see the positive elements of human nature emerge
 If you don’t react like this to babies
 Then you really have a serious problem
 this is not good
 But seeing these
 These people wandering listlessly in the street
 Suddenly their burdens and precautions were put down
 Babies are a bit like public property, which is strange
 Just like a pregnant woman
 People usually treat pregnant women as public property
 I mean positive
 They will say "You are going to have a baby"
 Then do some caring things for pregnant women
 The reason I told you this is
 People have a strong urge to understand
 The birth of a new life is a miracle
 The miracle is that this new life is full of potential
 This is all the potential that new life represents
 Every new life is born means
 Possibility of the birth of great people
 One thing I think about is
 One thing you don’t know is
 Before you have your own children
 Children are nothing special to you
 But your own child is special
 At the moment of his birth, this child
 Is someone who has a closer relationship with you
 May be closer than your relationship with anyone
 And you can keep this relationship perfect
 Most of the relationships you have established
 Are built with people who have problems in many ways
 You are not perfect
 But you now have this child
 It hasn't been destroyed yet
 You may maintain this relationship
 This kid likes you very much
 Generally it will last a long time
 When they were two years old
 They will be happy to see you when you go home
 Like raising a puppy
 The puppy is so happy when you go home
 How many people will be happy when you go home
 They might say "Hey again you"
 But kids are not like this
 The children are really happy when you go home
 You can keep this happy
 This is something that our society does not value
 The rustic elements of the relationship between children and parents
 As if we were covering our eyes voluntarily
 This is really a disaster
 Because it's really rare in life
 There are things that compare with children to build healthy relationships
 If you can maintain a good relationship with your children
 They will be good company
 It's worth the effort
 The reason I tell you this is
 People see baby
 They will think this may be a potential savior of mankind
 This is what they would think
 They act like this, they think like this
 Actually this is also true
 I don’t know how real it is
 But I think it might be because people are afraid to find the reason
 At least in my opinion
 "But for Christ
 "When he sacrificed himself
 "God his Heavenly Father also sacrificed his own son at the same time."
 "This is in Christianity
 "Sacrifice of son and self is the cause of archetype"
 "There is nothing greater than this."
 This is why it is a prototype
 You can't go beyond it
 "This is the definition of archetype"
 "This is the core of the religion."
 "In all possible sacrifices
 "The sacrifice of self and children is the greatest"
 "This is beyond doubt."
 "Pain and suffering define the world"
 "The same is true."
 "Those who want to resolve suffering
 "People who want the best possible future in architecture"
 "Those who want to build heaven on earth
 "So I will dedicate everything I have to God
 "Dedicated to the life living in the truth"
 This is the book I will publish in January
 Part of it
 Speaking of "Genesis", we have reached the fourth chapter
 "One day that man had a room with his wife Eve
 "Eve became pregnant and gave birth to Cain
 "Just say
 "The Lord gave me a man" (Genesis 4:1)
 This happened after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden
 what is interesting is
 I really think the story of Cain and Abel
 Is the deepest story I have ever read
 Especially because you can tell this story in 15 seconds
 I won’t tell a story in 15 seconds just because it’s hard for me
 You may have noticed this too
 But it’s so short you can read it right away
 It is so concise and concise
 I just can't
 I can't believe it can be so concise and concise
 First of all
 Adam and Eve were not the first humans
 Cain and Abel were the first humans
 Adam and Eve were created by God
 They were born in heaven
 What kind of human is this
 Humans are not like this
 Human beings were not created by God and born in heaven
 People are born of life
 This is the first thing
 This is after the "fall"
 We are now in the long history
 Not in the supernatural prototype
 Although to some extent we are still in the supernatural prototype
 But not to the degree of Adam and Eve
 We have been expelled from the Garden of Eden
 We already have self-awareness
 We are already sober
 We have learned to dress and work
 We are sound humans
 These are the first two humans
 Cain and Abel are two human archetypes
 It’s interesting that humans at the end of the Adam and Eve story
 Into history
 Then the prototype model of human behavior
 Be revealed immediately
 It's very unbelievable
 This is not a very beautiful story
 They are two rival brothers
 It can be said that they are choking each other
 Or at least one of them did
 This is a story about the first two humans hurting each other
 End with the death of the best one
 This is the story of human beings who entered history
 If this story can't make you have nightmares
 Then you didn't understand it at all
 In the stories of these hostile brothers
 These stories are very common
 Usually the brother is Cain
 This is true in the Bible
 Is true in many kinds of folktales
 In almost all stories
 Brother has an advantage
 He is brother
 In farming society
 Usually the older brother inherits the land
 Not brother
 The reason is
 Suppose you have eight sons
 You have enough land to feed your family
 You divide the land among eight sons
 They also have eight sons
 They divided their land among eight sons
 Soon the land will be divided into tiny shares
 Everyone will starve to death
 this will not work
 You give the whole land to the eldest son
 This is the right way
 Unfortunate for others
 But at least they will work hard by themselves
 It's really unfair, but fairness is really unattainable
 You can say that the eldest son is in the steady state of the existing hierarchy
 There are extra chips
 He has more chips in the status quo
 This makes him more like a symbol of the status quo
 And it’s easier to get lost
 It can be said like this
 This theme often appears in the struggle between rival brothers
 The story of Cain and Abel fits this pattern
 Because Cain is the one who doesn't want to regress
 He is stubborn
 However, the second son Abel
 He is usually
 Can't be said to be revolutionary
 May be more like a balance between revolution and tradition
 The eldest son is more like a traditional authoritarian
 At least in these metaphorical representations
 "One day that man had a room with his wife Eve
 "Eve became pregnant and gave birth to Cain
 "They said that the Lord made me a man" (Genesis 4:1)
 This is the first human Cain
 I have said before that Mesopotamians think
 Humans are imaginable by the goddess of chaos
 Made by the blood of the most evil demon
 The first human being was a murderer
 Not just a murderer, he is a brother killer
 You know the Old Testament
 This is a very strict book
 You think this is a bit too much
 But you will feel it is real
 This is something worth thinking about
 Humans are amazing creatures
 If you think of human beings as the plague of the earth
 The idea itself is a disaster
 Is a vicious and indecent
 Genocide metaphor
 But this does not mean that we are flawless
 This book is the cornerstone of our culture
 Describe the first human being as a brother killer
 Is really a blow to us
 "Cain's brother Abel was born again
 "Abel is the shepherd and Cain is the farmer" (Genesis 4:2)
 This is an old painting
 Abel on the left
 He put his sheep on the altar
 Cain brought a handful of wheat ears
 I am not very clear what this red line is
 This is blood or rays
 Almost like this
 Generally speaking, something transcendent
 Are communicating with this sacrifice
 You will think this is very primitive
 How primitive these people are to sacrifice to God
 These people are not stupid
 This is not original
 Not original anyway
 Its complexity is far beyond your imagination
 As I said, the idea is
 You can sacrifice something valuable
 This sacrifice will have a transcendent effect
 This is by no means a simple idea
 In fact, this may be the best idea that humans have come up with
 This answers the story of Adam and Eve
 Questions raised
 We have self-awareness
 We found the future
 We know the inevitability of death
 Understand our vulnerability
 We got shame
 We have established the concept of good and evil
 We were cast out of heaven
 This is a serious problem
 What should you do? The answer is sacrifice
 This is a hypothesis
 This is a very good assumption
 This is exactly what we are doing
 You make many sacrifices
 Even if you can sit in this theater
 Many people have made great sacrifices
 To build such a theater
 Many people made sacrifices
 So that we can be free in such a theater
 Engage in such a conversation
 Everything is built on the basis of sacrifice
 Sacrifice works best
 Because we can't think of a better idea
 What is the opposite of sacrifice
 Murder and theft
 Then let's stick to sacrifice, okay
 And we shouldn’t judge it as primitive
 This is by no means original
 "Cain's brother Abel was born again
 "Abel is a shepherd and Cain is a farmer" (Gen 4:2)
 Some people interpret this as
 The eternal struggle between the shepherd and the farmer
 The war swept the western United States
 The shepherd keeps his flock
 Go where you want
 Farmers and farmers built fences to block them
 In the end, the farmer won
 Back to the topic Abel is a shepherd
 It's funny he became a shepherd
 I think this is part of the critical issue
 Because the shepherd we discussed earlier
 If you observe Michelangelo’s "Statue of David"
 "The Statue of David" is a shocking masterpiece
 This David is not a small person
 Obviously David was the one who killed Goliath
 Goliath symbolizes the giant of the enemy of patriarchy
 Almost like this
 Shepherds in the Middle East take care of their sheep
 Sheep is edible
 Lamb is very fragile
 There are many wild predators outside
 Not the same as England in the 16th century
 There were lions in the wild at that time
 You are holding a slingshot or stick or what kind of weapon
 Your job is to look after the sheep alone
 Let them at least not be eaten by lions
 You must be strong and independent
 You have to have these qualities
 You have to be strong and independent
 You have to protect a lot of fragile things
 You have to be able to do it independently
 This is established in the shepherd metaphor
 This is not a good metaphor for modern people
 Because we would think
 Shepherd is like "Little Boy"
 Not to be a muscle monster that can kill lions
 Shepherds are not like this. We think shepherds are easy
 And the metaphor here is not like this
 "Abel is the shepherd and Cain is the farmer" (Genesis 4:2)
 "One day
 "Cain took the produce from the field as an offering
 "To the Lord" (Genesis 4:3)
 So he participated in the sacrificial activities
 "Abel also offered the firstborn of his flock and the fat of the sheep
 "The Lord saw Abel and his offerings" (Genesis 4:4)
 You don't understand why
 I think there is some inherent ambiguity here
 I’m not sure but I think it’s the context
 "Abel also took the firstborn of his flock
 "To offer the fat of sheep" (Genesis 4:4)
 What does this mean
 He brought high-quality sacrifices
 You can't say that what Cain brought is bad
 Because it is not said in the original text
 Did not say that Cain brought some rotten vegetables and burned it
 Didn't say so
 But there is no word
 Describe how high-quality Abel’s sacrifices are
 but no matter
 Jehovah has eyes on Abel and his offerings
 So there is a hint that Abel prepared sacrifices
 More attentive than Cain
 But there are such hints
 God likes you better than him
 This is a meaningful point of view from a literary point of view
 Because life is random
 Like one of my children
 He is always favored
 He is lucky, whatever you want to describe
 He seems to be this kind of person
 And my other child
 Just like Job, the unexplainable disaster followed one after another
 This is a very strange phenomenon because
 as far as I know
 Differences in personality
 Can't affect fate
 This suffering child
 She is really a great kid
 She is happy, sunny, approachable and humorous
 But she suffered too much
 Who knows what god is going to do
 Distributing fate fairly is certainly not one of his tasks
 "The Lord saw Abel and his offerings" (Genesis 4:4)
 "Just look down on Cain and his offerings
 "Cain was very angry" (Genesis 4:5)
 Angry is a serious word
 These articles have been translated many times
 It is difficult to grasp the full meaning of the word itself
 "His face changed from anger" (Genesis 4:4)
 So angry
 This is to raise the complexion
 Hanging face means heavy heart
 He is depressed, that's for sure
 He was furious, that's for sure
 It's not impossible for him to hold resentment
 "Get angry" is anger
 So Cain is not happy
 Because of his hard work was rejected by God
 This is worth thinking about
 How much humanity there is in this story
 You in life
 You may be a useless character
 You complain about how bad your life is
 For you and everyone around you
 Obviously everything is your fault
 You didn't make an effort
 You didn't get up early
 You are not looking for a job
 You didn't commit yourself fully
 You are full of cynical complaints and anger
 You are not eager to help people around you
 Don't try to save your life
 You didn't take care of yourself
 Then things became a mess
 Otherwise what do you think
 But that doesn’t mean that people in this situation will say
 "Okay, I deserve it" and settle down
 They won't
 They will always complain and be angry
 Let's not discuss this situation
 Some people are working hard to face the suffering every day
 But suffering still followed
 There is no easy answer in this story
 You can because your offering is inferior
 And offend God
 Or somehow you angered God
 Then you are really unlucky
 Then what will happen
 In either case, almost inevitable is the following result
 "Cain became very angry and his face changed" (Gen 4:4)
 People like this always write to me
 Many of my patients have this situation
 Few people in their 20s are more in their 30s
 Some in their 40s
 Their life is not going well
 Fell into despair
 Not only in despair
 They are still full of anger
 God knows if you give them a chance to vent
 What will they do with this anger
 One thing I always think about Hitler is
 Actually you have to convince Hitler
 He is an organizational genius
 Man will become Hitler's reason
 People did not have the ambition to become Hitler
 Not because they don’t have the motivation to destroy the race
 They don't imitate Hitler
 Because they don’t have this kind of organizational talent
 They have this kind of motivation
 If you randomly select 100 people
 You communicate with them in depth
 You will find 5% of people
 If you give them a chance
 They are willing to put their revenge plan into practice
 In fact they do it
 They make their lives miserable
 Usually drag their family into the water
 Sometimes they make everyone around them miserable
 And the other 20% of them
 It is normal for them to have such thoughts
 You should be sympathetic to Cain
 If you have no sympathy for Cain then you
 Cain and Abel do not merely represent the archetypes of the two modes of being
 It's not that you are Cain and you are Abel
 But you are a combination of the two
 Something like this
 These are two potential modes of fate
 You won’t fully show one kind of another
 It's like the dividing line between good and evil in human hearts
 This is exactly the same concept
 Maybe you are more like Cain
 Maybe you are more like Abel
 But no matter how much you resemble Abel
 You still have a little Cain in your heart
 Maybe you’re just a little bit like Cain, maybe more than a little
 If you observe your fantasy
 I strongly recommend you to observe
 You will find that if you allow yourself to be conscious of what you think
 You will be surprised at the dark side of these fantasies
 When you are arguing with someone
 Especially arguing with the one you love
 At this time you should observe carefully
 A picture flashing from the depths of your mind
 This is in part with Carl Jung’s
 "Shadows" are connected
 "Shadow" is Cain's manifestation
 It's very reasonable to think like this
 One of Jung's descriptions of "shadows"
 Jung’s view is not a joke
 He said that the roots of the "shadows" of mankind go straight to hell
 Jung is serious
 It's not a metaphor for him
 The meaning of his sentence may be the same
 Fundamentalist Christians in the Southern United States have a different understanding
 But I think Jung’s meaning is more scary
 And more real
 "Cain became very angry and his face changed" (Gen 4:4)
 In the middle of the picture is Abel burning his offering
 He and this we temporarily call
 "The original image of culture" establishes a certain relationship
 Archetype of the Father
 This is someone he respects
 This posture implies respect
 And Cain is here in the background
 His face is shrouded in shadows
 He is jealous of the status quo
 He's just doing things
 Maybe God really doesn't like him
 We don't know
 But he is really doing things perfunctory
 He feels very upset
 You can engrave this sentence on
 Many people’s epitaphs on their tombstones
 That is, "doing nothing but end in depression"
 I think this picture is very interesting
 I don't know what God is doing
 He is helping to light the sacrificial flame
 I think this is really interesting because
 We assume you have the urge to make sacrifices
 You think I have to change my life
 So where does this impulse come from
 It is out of nothing
 Or you figured it out
 You better not be so sure
 Your ideas are all your own
 Didn't you come up with your dream?
 They just happened
 God knows where they came from
 "They come from the brain."
 This answer is really brilliant
 "They come from your unconscious"
 This answer is not much better
 But at least a little better
 These amazing episodes at night
 Happen in your hall of imagination
 You don't even understand what they are
 But they will appear every night
 Dreams can also contain wisdom
 If people can understand the main points of dreams and remember them
 They will be very shocked
 It's like watching
 You reveal to yourself wisdom that you don't know
 Where did this come from
 You do not know
 Why on earth can you dream of things you don't know
 This is a problem
 Maybe in a certain lecture
 We will discuss this issue
 Because about this question
 There are still a few reasonable answers
 There is such a theory that it is not yourself
 Jung called it "self"
 He thinks this is the sum of your existence across time and space
 Almost like this
 Every moment you exist
 It’s the side of your "self" that crosses time and space.
 He believes that "self" is part of the expression of conscience
 No matter what "conscience" refers to this will be
 Help you when you make difficult choices
 The difficult choice may be what I need to sacrifice
 How do I achieve self-discipline
 What do i need to give up
 How do you figure out these things
 This painting is to express such an idea
 If you have a good relationship with the Father
 We discussed what it means
 He will help you figure out how to light a sacrificial fire
 So that you can maintain a good relationship with the Father for a long time
 Is this an unreasonable proposal
 What's the other proposal
 What is certain is that Cain’s situation in the picture is not a good result
 I don't know what Cain is doing
 Maybe he thinks only he can do it
 Or he just wants to take credit or something
 He has neither gratitude nor humility
 There is no gratitude or humility in his posture
 The pious posture should be like Abel's
 Should be grateful and humble
 Gratitude should be
 "Thank God for not making my life worse than the status quo"
 You should be grateful
 Because your life may be worse than the status quo
 Your life can be very bad
 Humility should be
 "I don't know how I can do better
 "But I am willing to listen to your suggestions."
 "If I can figure out what to do, I will try hard."
 This is humility and humility
 How can i do better
 Something like this
 What kind of sacrifice do I need to make to make everything better
 You should ask yourself this question
 You can ask yourself every morning
 What kind of sacrifice do I need to make to make everything better
 You can decide what is the definition of "better"
 Then this is not imposed on you
 It’s you who figured out what constitutes "better" for you
 Try to perfect this concept
 You shouldn't just be better for yourself
 It doesn't work is it
 If you are only for yourself, you will only go downhill
 Because you live with others
 And this idea is stupid no matter what
 What are you going to do
 Really have nothing to say
 This is the attitude of two-year-olds who behave misbehaving and sexually violent.
 I'm not kidding
 You can ask yourself
 I have this whole day to plan
 I need to give up something that hinders my progress
 If I give up these things my life will be better
 My family's life will be better
 The cultural ecology behind me will get better
 My being will become better
 This will give you a plan for your day, right
 This will prove the meaning of your miserable life
 You need to do
 This is the gist of the first story of Adam and Eve
 What a miserable life do you have
 What do you need to do
 If your life is miserable
 If you just endure the pain stupidly and complain
 This is what Cain did
 What if you choose not to
 Making bad choices things can get worse
 Then if you make sacrifices
 See if you can please God to get the being back on track
 This is what to do
 Is there a better choice than this
 Could there be a better option
 This is why it is a prototype
 Because there is nothing better than it, it is optimal
 You can do it every day
 You have to do it bit by bit
 What are you
 You can't send a cannon for humans
 A socialist utopia
 You can think of it this way. Cain might figure this out.
 There are several things that are not good for him
 Downstream of the wind
 Not a good place to fan fire
 The fact is that he is shrouded in smoke
 And inhaling the haze
 The fire didn't start
 May indicate that he did something wrong
 Or he said while wiping tears
 "My God, what stupid world can give birth to such a haze"
 This is the more likely result
 "The Lord said to Cain
 "'Why are you angry?
 ""Why have you changed your complexion?" (Genesis 4:6)
 ""Will you not be acceptable if you do well"" (Genesis 4:7)
 This sentence is very interesting
 I have seen many versions of translations in this seventh section
 This is a very important sentence and its translation is really important
 Let me tell you what I think the story is like
 And what i figured out
 I'm sure I didn't fully understand
 God says "If you do well, won't you be acceptable?"
 This is a hint right
 It's like when you get frustrated
 The first thing you will think is that you failed to do well
 Does this mean what you are doing is not good
 Does this mean your behavior is inappropriate
 This is a reminder that God is suggesting
 You will succeed if you behave properly
 I once had a friend who said in a way
 A person full of resentment
 He used to have problems
 Part of the problem is to blame
 Part of the problem is destined. I think
 He has become very destructive
 I think it’s the kind of destructive life
 Can be seen in his dreams
 He lived with me for a while
 I know him well
 He has been my friend since I was 12
 Until he committed suicide around 40
 When he lived with me
 I tried to cheer him up
 This is why he came to live with me
 Because he thinks maybe I can help him cheer up
 He can only do some low-end jobs
 He has some mechanical skills
 Although he is not well educated
 But very very smart
 His IQ may be around 135
 He is smart but unwilling
 Because he didn't let himself be educated
 Matches his intelligence
 He can only do some work under his intelligence
 He really has that intellectual arrogance and
 Really smart people often believe that only smartness is the most important thing
 If they are smart
 And only being smart is the most important
 Then the world will surrender to their feet
 Then they will be betrayed brutally
 Then they focus on their intelligence
 At this time intelligence is more like a gift or genius
 It's like an idol, a false idol
 Is such a very dangerous idol
 Because of the stupidity of the world
 And they become cynical
 But this is not helpful
 Smart is a good thing but I want to tell you
 If you don’t make good use of it, it will eat you back
 Like all the talents given at will
 You may have talent
 But only by making good use of it will it become your friend
 If you use it wrongly, it will become your enemy
 Maybe God adjusts the scale of the universe in this way
 In short, my friend is a very smart person
 Although unfortunately not as smart as he imagined
 He didn't make good use of his intelligence
 Failed to show it to the world well
 It also made him angry
 Because he also knows
 If he makes good use of his intelligence
 His achievements will go beyond this
 Maybe now he can achieve higher achievements
 I suggest him when he is living with us
 Because at that time he almost became a tramp
 I suggest that he should find a job within his capacity
 Jobs like working in garbage stations and shops
 Because he is better at mechanical principles
 I also suggest that he should give up that arrogance
 I think this kind of job is not worthy of him
 No job was not worthy of him in that situation
 But more importantly
 "Work is not worthy of people" actually doesn't make sense
 You know because
 Imagine you have a job at a grocery store
 This is a fairly unskilled job
 You can be a hapless grumbling while doing this job
 It can also be an annoying person
 You can go to work
 Just lose your temper and complain and make mistakes
 Guarantee any customer
 When I pass by you, I have to stop for a day
 You can steal from the busy or even guard yourself
 Dissatisfied with the employer
 Because they are higher than you in this dominance level
 You can also talk bad and gossip behind your colleagues
 You can accept this humble job that you think
 Then transform it into a little hell
 You can do it
 You go to a place like this
 I always think of such a prototype of a roadside snack bar
 You have all been to this kind of shop
 Of course there are also good restaurants
 There is a very good video on YouTube
 Tom Weitz read a poem in it
 Written by Bukowski
 I remember this poem is called "Nirvana"
 This is a poem about a good store
 Bukowski took the bus as a child
 A small restaurant I visited by accident
 It's a nice restaurant everywhere
 You can listen to it is great
 But this one I think of is completely different
 You walk into the small restaurant
 It's seven o'clock in the morning
 You ordered bacon, eggs and some toast
 You look around you think
 The windows seem to have not been wiped since 1975
 There is a thick layer of old oil stains on the surrounding walls
 The floor is also slimy
 It really takes years to do it
 The waitress was glum there
 The guy behind the counter also pulled his face
 Because it happened to be on duty with the waitress
 Then you go downstairs to the bathroom
 And it took quite a while
 You came back and ordered an egg
 Ordered a toast and ordered a bacon
 The rice came up, but the egg was fried
 So it becomes brownish black but it's a bit raw on it
 Still cold in the middle
 You really need to spend some time to make this kind of egg
 But ten years of resentment can let you easily control this technology
 It will tell you how to make such an egg
 Then it’s toast, here’s toast
 You take white bread first
 The kind of bread that no one wants to eat
 And put it in the bread machine
 Burn it
 Wait a minute and let the toast pop out of the bread machine
 Because it's burnt, we need to scrape off the black ash
 You flick some crumbs to make them look less burnt
 Then you wait for it to get cold and apply cold margarine
 First of all it is not butter
 But if you put on cold margarine
 The cream will be spread like a honeycomb
 Secondly, the margarine will condense into pieces and very dry
 But very greasy
 It's like a chic work of art
 You put it next to the egg
 Then bring potatoes
 Here is how to make potatoes
 First, we have to make leftover potatoes
 And you have to keep putting new leftover potatoes for weeks
 Mixed into old potatoes
 Some potatoes can't be called potatoes
 Some of them have already returned to the embrace of Mother Earth
 You dump them on the grill
 Then symbolically I don’t know what to say and burn it twice.
 And throw it on the plate
 You won't want to eat this stuff, no doubt
 But this is the key
 Then you have to take out the bacon
 You have to make sure that you buy the worst bacon
 So we can start
 You throw them on the grill
 For this, your grill must be overheated
 So you fried bacon
 There will be some place where there will be some place
 It has a pleasant pig smell
 Only the bacon that is very cheap and smashed will have
 Or you can use that kind of breakfast sausage
 If it wasn't for the brain water
 No one would put this sausage within five meters of a person
 Then you serve
 The so-called orange juice was served together
 The only thing that looks like an orange is the color
 There is also coffee
 How do you say this shop opened too early in the morning
 This is the first condition
 A cup of poor quality coffee started the day prematurely
 It has been cold once or twice and reheated
 Then you add whitening powder when you serve it
 Now your breakfast is ready
 Who likes to eat
 This is breakfast, this is hell
 And this is the hell you made by yourself
 What would you do if you had such a restaurant
 Because if you have such a restaurant
 You will live a miserable life
 You really worked hard on this matter
 You go home and scold your wife and children
 And yell at God
 Because he actually created a world
 Allow such a restaurant you run to exist
 This is your bloody life
 This is what God wants to warn of here
 "If you do well, won't you be accepted?"
 "If you don’t do well, sin at the door" (Genesis 4:7)
 I actually checked a lot of translations for this sentence
 Its next sentence is
 "It will adore you but you will subdue it" (Genesis 4:7)
 God wants to say like this
 Things are not going well for you
 But things will get better if you behave decently
 But you did the opposite
 Sin comes to your door
 "Sin" means miss the target
 Sin comes to your door
 But he used a metaphorical approach
 This metaphor is like saying
 Sin comes to your door like a cat in heat
 You invited it in at the beginning
 Then you let it do whatever it wants
 It’s like you have entered a creative
 He uses a sexual metaphor
 You enter a creative exchange with it
 And produce a result
 No matter what you give birth to, that is your life
 You know it well
 After all you have self-awareness
 You know what you are doing
 You conspired with it
 Create a situation where you put yourself in it
 Jung once described it
 Similar to Oedipus complex
 Of course his views are not politically correct
 Of course everything he wrote is not politically correct
 That's why it can be called a thinker
 He said that an evil alliance exists in
 Between children who are extremely dependent on others and their mothers
 He said actually
 Freud thought it was about motherhood
 I'm not belittling Freud
 Freud geniusly sketched the Oedipus complex
 I'm not belittling Freud
 But Jung accepted these ideas and extended them
 He said that an evil alliance exists in
 In a child who is extremely dependent on others
 With an Oedipus complex
 Between mothers who are too dependent on others
 In this alliance, mothers always give
 So for example, when a child wants to do something
 When things require a little courage and hard work
 And the mother would say "Do you think you can do it?"
 Then the child will say "Yes" or "No"
 Then his mother will coax him to bed and take care of everything
 But the fact is that the child also made a decision
 You would think it's cruel to children
 But don’t think children are stupid just because they are young
 If you don’t know how children understand
 You don’t know how to manipulate the child
 They are unexpectedly good at this
 He will keep studying you trying to figure out
 What is your intention
 2. How can they achieve their goals as they wish
 They can play manipulation games without a doubt
 Especially when they practice hard
 Kind of like this
 Maybe the mother is a little timid and overprotective
 And the child may manipulate a little
 I'm not willing to take a brave step to integrate into the world
 On the contrary, they are willing to degenerate into a dependent state
 Over time, a terrible dynamic will be established
 Like a vicious circle
 Or like a positive feedback loop
 It keeps expanding and expanding
 Sometimes in some families you can see
 Have a very attached child
 Share the same mother with a very independent child
 Mother is very complicated
 The mother is different for child A and child B
 Even if they are the same person
 Have a clear description of this literary work
 You should know what I mean
 God's will is
 Not only pay attention to whether you behave properly
 Because you did misbehaving
 It’s because of your misbehavior
 You really spent time researching how to misbehave
 This seems to be your creative endeavor
 If you want to understand the real vicious person
 You can start with the Columbine campus killer
 They leave many interesting diaries
 I recommend everyone to read
 You can read more about serial killers
 These people really went out and did some very dark things
 I read a lot of this stuff
 And know it very well
 If you really want to make yourself hateful
 Then think about your own disaster for ten years
 Be alone and let your fantasy take shape to encourage them
 Let them blossom and bear fruit, in other words let them control you
 This is the correct idea to understand this diary
 It will bring you to such a situation
 There are more people like this than you think
 And you are more like this kind of person than you think
 So Cain is obviously very unhappy with the whole answer
 If your people generate a disaster
 This is the last thing you want to hear
 And in your heart, God created the world
 And this world allows this kind of thing to happen
 In the end it said it was your own fault
 And said you should cheer up
 And you should not complain about the nature of being
 This is the answer he got
 What will happen next
 We can almost conclude
 If Cain was resentful before
 Then he is even more angry now
 Of course this is exactly what the story intends to reveal
 "Cain speaks with his brother Abel
 "The two are in the field
 "Cain got up and beat his brother Abel
 "Kill him" (Genesis 4:8)
 I am going to read something else to everyone
 Pave the way for the back
 Also this part comes from the same chapter of my book
 The chapter is titled "Do meaningful things, not expedients"
 "According to the story
 "'Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 4:1)
 "Be "tempted by the devil" before being nailed to the cross (Matthew 4:1)"
 "This is an abstract retelling of Cain's story."
 "As we see Cain is very unhappy."
 "He works hard or he thinks so
 "But God is not satisfied"
 "At the same time Abel is dancing among the daisies"
 "His harvest, women also like him."
 "What's worse is that he is a very good person."
 "Everyone understands this."
 "He deserves his luck."
 "This adds another reason to hate him."
 I used to make jokes when I taught at Harvard
 My wife will invite young graduate students to be guests at home from time to time
 Afterwards we often make jokes
 Because most of them are outstanding children
 They are extremely smart or possess sports expertise
 Or have theatrical or musical talent
 Or have done a remarkable charity act
 Because I basically have to be admitted to Harvard
 You must be the top person in your school
 Then you need to have at least
 Two other outstanding advantages
 The most annoying thing about most of these kids is
 This is a joke, you really like and respect them
 My joke is
 You think they must have at least some desirable qualities
 To be a nasty bastard
 Except for all other advantages in them
 They also need to behave nicely
 So you think
 "Such good things should happen to them"
 Gosh
 It's like Abel's situation
 The funny thing is that this is an ideal
 This is the ideal
 It can be said that this is an ideal person
 This is the person you want to be
 What this person does in this world
 Is what you want to do
 This person is favored by fate
 This person made the right sacrifice
 This is who you want to be
 So Cain killed him
 This is also a psychological story
 When people express cynical views about successful people in the world
 You can find this psychology
 They are always speculating about the reasons for their success
 "They must do whatever it takes."
 "They must be scheming."
 "They must be arrogant and rude"
 "They must be mentally perverted."
 Of course these all exist
 But self-deception is a terrible trick
 Think this person in the world
 The person who represents your ideal
 It's all created by despicable reasons
 Because you will train yourself accordingly
 If the ideal life you should pursue exists, it can only be
 Motivated by despicable reasons
 Then, not only Abel, your brother died
 Just like your brother in reality in the field
 At the same time you have destroyed your ideals
 What are you going after?
 How will you live
 There is no doubt that it is full of misery and pain
 Full of complaints and misery
 You will live like this
 I rarely see it especially in public
 People honestly admit that except for sports stars
 This place seems to happen
 But people in any public communication
 It is rare to express admiration and gratitude
 Various newspapers and TV shows on YouTube and Twitter
 Almost always slander and criticism
 And often for those
 Those single-minded
 People who benefit others
 This is one reason why this story has a profound meaning
 "He is a nice guy everyone knows"
 "His luck deserves it"
 "There is more reason to hate him." No doubt
 "Cain is anxious about his misfortune
 "Like a vulture hatching an egg"
 "He entered the desert of his own mind."
 "He was trapped by his own misfortune and betrayal."
 "He nourishes his resentment"
 "He is addicted to more and more detailed revenge fantasy"
 "His arrogance reached the level of Lucifer."
 "'I have been abused and oppressed,' he thinks."
 ""This is a stupid damn earth" should go to hell"
 "In this case he met Satan in the wilderness
 "And captured by Satan's temptation"
 "He did his best
 "To use the timeless words of John Milton
 "'Uproot humans
 "『Make the earth and hell mixed together
 ""Let everyone hate the great Creator""
 "He became evil in order to obtain good forbidden him to get"
 "When he did this, he was voluntarily sober and malicious."
 ""Whoever has ears to hear should listen" (Matthew 11:15)"
 The picture shows the first two humans
 A loser full of grudges and complaints
 Picked up the axe and slashed at the admirable winner
 "The Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?"
 "He said, "I don't know
 "Am I the guardian of my brother" (Genesis 4:9)
 "The Lord said, "What have you done?"
 "'Your brother's blood has a voice
 ""Well to me from the ground" (Genesis 4:10)
 "『I opened my mouth
 "'Receive your brother's blood from you
 ""Now you will be cursed from this land"" (Genesis 4:11)
 If you want to understand this sentence then I suggest
 You can read "Crime and Punishment" by Dostoevsky
 This is a great novel
 I think it may be the greatest novel to date
 I haven't read all the novels but according to my experience
 This is the greatest novel worthy of its name
 It tells the psychological changes when you commit a big crime
 Amazing
 Psychologists like Dostoyevsky are unparalleled in the world
 "『You farm
 "'The land no longer works for you
 "'You will drift away on the ground'" (Gen 4:12)
 "Cain said to Jehovah
 "'My punishment is too heavy
 ""More than I can be"" (Genesis 4:13)
 One of the interesting things is
 I think the punishment God imposed on Cain
 It's like the inevitable consequence of Cain's actions
 It means he killed his brother
 Death cannot be resurrected
 You will never forgive yourself for this
 Not to mention he is an ideal he is your ideal
 Because you not only killed your brother
 Of course you also torture your parents and other relatives
 You wiped out a righteous person in your community
 And because of the most vicious motive
 Then your good day is over
 Want me to say this is what you can do on earth
 The closest thing to hell
 "Cain said to the Lord
 "'My punishment is too heavy
 ""More than I can be"" (Genesis 4:13)
 "'You are chasing me out of this place now
 ""So that I can't see you"" (Genesis 4:14)
 It is true that after making this kind of mistake
 You can't turn back the prodigal son and convert to God
 Because you have tried your best
 To offend God, if he exists
 The possibility that you can repair this relationship
 This relationship in a severed state
 It was impossible to fix from the beginning
 Because you did such a bad thing before
 The possibility of this repair approaches zero
 ""Whoever meets me will kill me" (Genesis 4:14)
 "The Lord said to him
 "'Whoever kills Cain will be punished seven times'
 "The Lord gave Cain a mark
 "Lest people meet him and kill him" (Genesis 4:15)
 This is an interesting thing
 I used to think for a long time
 You might not figure it out
 Why should God shelter Cain
 And on the premise that he committed such atrocity
 I think this is related to the emergence of an idea
 That is to say, it is necessary to prevent "retaliation" style retaliatory killings
 Roughly what it means
 This is implied in later chapters
 It's like okay i killed your brother
 Then you killed my two brothers
 Then I killed your family
 Then you killed people in my entire town
 Then I killed you all over the country
 Then we destroyed the world together
 This should not be a clever way to solve the original problem
 Despite the initial problem
 It may be about murder that is not easy to solve
 But i think so
 The last part of this story
 This painting is the work of William Black
 Adam and Eve found their dead son
 I think Cain also started to realize
 What he did and what he was
 This is another way to self-awareness
 Adam and Eve are in the process of forming self-awareness
 Very painful
 They begin to recognize their own fragile nudity
 And maybe they have the ability to do evil
 But Cain began to realize that he was
 Willing to walk with evil
 And think this is a vital ability for humans
 We modern people
 We don’t take this seriously
 In academic circles and intellectual circles
 The idea of ​​evil has been
 Everyone will ask "Where did you come from?"
 "When was the Middle Ages?"
 If a topic as a starting point of knowledge
 This whole idea of ​​"evil" will die before you get away.
 This is something I have never understood
 I can't understand how you did it
 There is only a superficial understanding of the history of the 20th century
 No need to have a deep understanding of 20th century history
 After that, but failed to draw the following conclusions
 "Good may not exist but evil"
 The existence of evil is ironclad
 Denying its existence can only mean pretending to be invisible
 This is a very useful discovery for me
 I can also infer that if evil does exist
 Then according to the inference, its opposite should also exist
 The opposite of evil
 Take the evil in the concentration camp as an example
 Our understanding of the above will be more clear
 This happened in Auschwitz
 They drove people off the train at the station
 Those who are still alive
 Not the people crowded together outside the car
 They have been frozen to death due to the cold
 But those who are squeezed in the middle to be warmer
 Maybe some old people will die from suffocation
 But at least some people were still alive when they arrived in Auschwitz
 They drove these poor people out
 One of the tricks soldiers often play against them is
 Let the new prisoners carry
 Sacks containing approximately 45 kg of wet salt
 Move from one end of the camp
 These camps are huge
 Like a city
 It's not like a gym, it's like a city
 Thousands of people are there
 They let these people carry wet salt bags
 From one end of the camp to the other and back
 This is ironic of a concept
 That is "work gives you freedom"
 It’s like saying "Think beautiful"
 "You are exhausted and exhausted here."
 In a sense it wants to explain the opposite of sacrifice
 We let you do your job
 But it can only speed up your death
 Maybe we can embellish it
 Because it will not only speed up your death
 It will also proceed in a painful way
 It also raises a possibility
 That is to say, other people are suffering from the same disease, it is better to die
 There is no doubt that this is an art
 If you understand this kind of thing
 Don’t think this is evil yet
 Then you will understand what this means to you
 "So Cain left the presence of the Lord
 "Go and live in the land of Nod, east of Eden" (Genesis 4:16)
 "Cain had sex with his wife
 "His wife became pregnant" (Genesis 4:17)
 There is a criticism
 A common criticism of "Bible" stories
 That is, "If Cain and Abel are
 "The only two children of Adam and Eve
 "So where did the others come from"
 "Does this story seem a bit brainless"
 No, this question will make the reader seem brainless
 I mean are you serious
 Is this the best criticism you can think of
 You might say "Oh, you didn't catch the point"
 And the correct answer to this criticism is
 "You didn't catch the point."
 "Cain had sex with his wife and his wife became pregnant
 "Born Enoch
 "Cain built a city" (Genesis 4:17)
 It was Cain who built the city and started civilization
 This is also unacceptable
 This is the first brother killer
 Built a city named after his son Enoch
 "Enoch beg Enoch" (Genesis 4:18), etc.
 I will skip generations here
 "Lamech married two wives
 "One named Yada
 "One named Zela" (Genesis 4:19)
 Here is an attempt to outline the genealogy
 And describe in these tribal communities
 To some degree
 "Ada Sheng Ya 8
 "Yaba is living in a tent
 "The Patriarch of People Who Keep Livestock" (Genesis 4:20)
 "Jabal’s brother’s name is Jubal
 "He is everything
 "The ancestor of those who play the piano and flute" (Gen 4:21)
 "Zela gave birth to Tubal Cain again
 "He made all kinds of bronze and iron weapons" (Genesis 4:22)
 Tubal Cain is traditionally speaking
 Is the first person to make weapons of war
 "Lamech" returns to the descendants of Lamech Cain
 "Lamech said to his two wives
 "Ada Zela listen to my voice
 "Lamech’s wife listens to my words
 "The mature man hurt me and I killed him
 "The young man hurt me and I killed him" (Genesis 4:23)
 "If Cain was killed seven times
 "Kill Lamech will be punished seventy-seven times" (Genesis 4:24)
 A tendency I see here
 Is Cain’s ability to murder
 With the development of society
 This ability has also developed into murder intent
 This goes beyond just killing brothers
 In the beginning it was "You hurt me, I will retaliate with hurt"
 And then "You hurt me
 "I'm going to kill you and six other people."
 Then developed to
 "Not 7 people killed but 70 people"
 So there is a view
 Once the first seed of murder is planted
 It will grow exponentially
 This is a warning
 This is why I think Tubal Cain
 This descendant of Cain
 Was the first to make weapons of war
 The story about Cain and Abel is almost told
 As far as I am concerned, this story is not trivial
 I think this story is always worth thinking about
 Because there are too many angles to interpret it
 I think the point revealed by these angles is
 The potential of this story
 Once understood
 Not only will you recognize your failure
 Or to recognize your rejection by being
 And recognize your tendency to murder the best
 And the tendency to murder the best in your own heart
 Just for revenge
 Because that means
 We know that as Adam and Eve committed the original sin
 The knowledge of good and evil has also come to the world
 Recognizing that tendency means that now
 Humans not only have to deal with
 Tragedy and suffering
 Even sacrificing properly is in vain
 And bring real malice into the world
 So there is a "degenerate" into history
 Then I discovered that sacrifice is a good medicine for "depravity"
 Then look back and find
 Malicious appearance
 Became a sacrificed enemy
 That’s the story of Cain and Abel
 This lecture comes to an end, thank you everyone
