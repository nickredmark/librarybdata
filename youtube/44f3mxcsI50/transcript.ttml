<p begin="00:00:17.119" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2"> I want to read something for you</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:19.989" style="s2"> I received a lot of letters</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.824" end="00:00:22.144" style="s2"> I forgot where this letter came from</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.144" end="00:00:25.024" style="s2"> I have been to many different places last week</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.024" end="00:00:27.904" style="s2"> And this letter comes from one of the places</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.298" end="00:00:29.488" style="s2"> I&#39;ll read it to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.488" end="00:00:30.957" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what to think about this myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.281" end="00:00:36.901" style="s2"> This should be written by a lady</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.954" end="00:00:39.426" style="s2"> I can only guess this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.426" end="00:00:41.169" style="s2"> No address and name on it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.741" end="00:00:45.250" style="s2"> &quot;This is not a question but a statement</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.845" end="00:00:48.821" style="s2"> &quot;Or more accurately maybe it&#39;s a revelation.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.676" end="00:00:53.557" style="s2"> &quot;I attended an Ayahuasca ceremony last weekend</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.557" end="00:00:56.501" style="s2"> &quot;If you haven&#39;t heard of it,</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.501" end="00:00:59.637" style="s2"> &quot;This is a South American hallucinogenic herb&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.187" end="00:01:02.069" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe some of you will disdain this</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.157" end="00:01:05.781" style="s2"> &quot;But Ayahuasca can bring you directly</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.781" end="00:01:08.021" style="s2"> &quot;The Prototype World of Being&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.935" end="00:01:13.333" style="s2"> &quot;Those who try this drug should say that the first try</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.684" end="00:01:15.829" style="s2"> &quot;I will call Ayahuasui &quot;she&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.450" end="00:01:19.413" style="s2"> &quot;Because the spirit of this plant is absolutely feminine</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.572" end="00:01:21.795" style="s2"> &quot;And the encounter with Ayahuasca is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.795" end="00:01:24.853" style="s2"> &quot;With the Mother Earth Goddess of Creation</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.853" end="00:01:26.503" style="s2"> &quot;The Void Encounter of the Source of Everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.181" end="00:01:29.039" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s the feminine equivalent of Logos.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.208" end="00:01:31.189" style="s2"> &quot;Dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.237" end="00:01:35.925" style="s2"> &quot;You appeared in my Ayahuasca illusion&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.717" end="00:01:49.621" style="s2"> This may be the reason why I am so tired recently</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.675" end="00:01:52.523" style="s2"> &quot;Dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.523" end="00:01:54.635" style="s2"> &quot;You appeared in my Ayahuasca illusion</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.635" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2"> &quot;Then I asked her who Jordan Peterson is&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:01:59.615" style="s2"> &quot;What is he doing?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.615" end="00:02:02.303" style="s2"> I want to know this too</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.519" end="00:02:06.054" style="s2"> &quot;She answered clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.559" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2"> &quot;『He is here to wake up and teach</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.035" end="00:02:15.741" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;The Holy Way of Masculine on Earth&quot;&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.110" end="00:02:29.029" style="s2"> &quot;So I am here to represent</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.029" end="00:02:31.678" style="s2"> &quot;The great mother is the goddess</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.678" end="00:02:33.342" style="s2"> &quot;And the holy feminine way, thank you sincerely</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.342" end="00:02:34.942" style="s2"> &quot;She has been eagerly looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.942" end="00:02:39.906" style="s2"> &quot;The awakening of the masculine way merges into the divinity and serves it&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.409" end="00:02:44.206" style="s2"> You can’t get this kind of letter every day</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.462" end="00:02:49.022" style="s2"> Actually, I receive one or two such letters every day</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.270" end="00:02:56.002" style="s2"> When I read it, what I thought in my head was</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.002" end="00:02:59.774" style="s2"> Of course this is a completely crazy analogy</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.774" end="00:03:02.782" style="s2"> But as a psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.580" end="00:03:05.014" style="s2"> One thing I learned is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.014" end="00:03:08.382" style="s2"> Tell the client what I think at this time</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.686" end="00:03:11.553" style="s2"> I&#39;m not thinking exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.553" end="00:03:13.281" style="s2"> That&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.478" end="00:03:16.481" style="s2"> What comes to my mind is more like a dream</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.481" end="00:03:18.977" style="s2"> It is spontaneous as imagined</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.297" end="00:03:20.577" style="s2"> If you are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.577" end="00:03:23.137" style="s2"> Then there will be an active ingredient, right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.137" end="00:03:25.762" style="s2"> I mean, God knows how we think</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.908" end="00:03:28.476" style="s2"> But at least part of it is actively involved</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.000" end="00:03:33.750" style="s2"> Jung thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.770" end="00:03:35.882" style="s2"> Dialogue between conscious and unconscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.882" end="00:03:37.866" style="s2"> It is a continuous conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.866" end="00:03:40.170" style="s2"> But when things suddenly come to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.234" end="00:03:43.242" style="s2"> It&#39;s like walking into a room suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.242" end="00:03:44.522" style="s2"> There is something in the room</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.522" end="00:03:47.018" style="s2"> By the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.018" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2"> This is also an inspiration I got from Jung</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.246" end="00:03:50.090" style="s2"> He pointed out very correctly</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.626" end="00:03:51.910" style="s2"> People are not really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.766" end="00:03:53.601" style="s2"> But those thoughts are showing to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.065" end="00:03:56.941" style="s2"> So you can extract these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.233" end="00:04:01.064" style="s2"> And criticize them, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.064" end="00:04:03.082" style="s2"> Instead of just assuming they are correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.413" end="00:04:04.885" style="s2"> But people don’t usually do</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.260" end="00:04:06.538" style="s2"> As long as an idea suddenly appears in their minds</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.538" end="00:04:07.672" style="s2"> They will believe it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.707" end="00:04:12.807" style="s2"> Anyway, one thing I often do in psychotherapy is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.194" end="00:04:15.178" style="s2"> Tell people what&#39;s in my head</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.300" end="00:04:19.786" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.018" end="00:04:23.997" style="s2"> Because the person who talks to me like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.373" end="00:04:28.037" style="s2"> Can receive an undisturbed view</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.382" end="00:04:29.655" style="s2"> This is not even an opinion but a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.791" end="00:04:32.410" style="s2"> I think this is really not an opinion</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.881" end="00:04:35.031" style="s2"> The point of view may be the result of my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.354" end="00:04:36.889" style="s2"> It has a subjective meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.588" end="00:04:42.233" style="s2"> I suddenly thought of a story about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.275" end="00:04:46.618" style="s2"> He was</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.618" end="00:04:49.972" style="s2"> At the trial for poisoning the youth of the whole country</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.636" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2"> By the way, I have also been charged with the same crime</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.131" end="00:04:55.540" style="s2"> But what I think is obvious is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.540" end="00:04:56.756" style="s2"> It’s not me who is doing the so-called poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.925" end="00:05:04.948" style="s2"> So someone once asked the priestess of the Temple of Delphi</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.292" end="00:05:08.642" style="s2"> The Temple of Delphi is equivalent to a place of retreat</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.642" end="00:05:10.946" style="s2"> If you are an ancient Greek citizen</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.525" end="00:05:13.762" style="s2"> You will have a dream when you go there</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.762" end="00:05:16.482" style="s2"> Then you will go to the priestess of Delphi to interpret the dream</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.909" end="00:05:20.741" style="s2"> No one really understands the priestess of Delphi today</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.741" end="00:05:22.157" style="s2"> And her psionic principles</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.515" end="00:05:24.425" style="s2"> Anyway, she can explain your dream</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.933" end="00:05:29.901" style="s2"> Someone once asked her who is the wisest person in Greece</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.751" end="00:05:32.653" style="s2"> Delphi priestess said it was Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.653" end="00:05:34.038" style="s2"> Because he knows he doesn&#39;t understand anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.853" end="00:05:36.137" style="s2"> This story is probably like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.440" end="00:05:37.941" style="s2"> This story appeared in my mind at the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.453" end="00:05:39.669" style="s2"> It&#39;s crazy to compare myself to Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.669" end="00:05:42.037" style="s2"> But my mind is already wild</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.037" end="00:05:43.509" style="s2"> So I can accept this result</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.375" end="00:05:48.436" style="s2"> Now i have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.225" end="00:05:50.542" style="s2"> I haven&#39;t done this before</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.150" end="00:05:52.797" style="s2"> I want to read you a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.089" end="00:05:54.655" style="s2"> I mentioned before that I finished my book last week</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.335" end="00:05:57.639" style="s2"> I haven&#39;t read it to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.639" end="00:06:01.031" style="s2"> I only shared with a few friends and asked them to proofread</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.991" end="00:06:03.591" style="s2"> Here is a special mention of someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.167" end="00:06:05.959" style="s2"> A screenwriter named Greg Herwitz</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.087" end="00:06:08.197" style="s2"> His help to me is immense</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.197" end="00:06:10.550" style="s2"> He is efficient and accurate in this type of work</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.887" end="00:06:16.581" style="s2"> If I send him a 20-page manuscript</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.581" end="00:06:18.117" style="s2"> He will edit the article drastically</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.117" end="00:06:20.229" style="s2"> And send it back to me within 90 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.229" end="00:06:21.637" style="s2"> It&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.637" end="00:06:22.202" style="s2"> He is really good at this job</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.202" end="00:06:23.131" style="s2"> Helped me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.131" end="00:06:26.629" style="s2"> But no one has read these manuscripts except my editor</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.629" end="00:06:28.131" style="s2"> I haven&#39;t read it to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.517" end="00:06:32.389" style="s2"> But some of them seem to be particularly suitable for tonight’s lecture</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.277" end="00:06:37.957" style="s2"> So I think tonight’s lecture will start with these articles</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.768" end="00:06:42.757" style="s2"> Taken from the chapter on sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.757" end="00:06:43.830" style="s2"> This is about Abraham and Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.342" end="00:06:46.469" style="s2"> It’s a very strange Old Testament story</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.469" end="00:06:50.437" style="s2"> This kind of story contained in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.437" end="00:06:51.781" style="s2"> May make us modern people feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.781" end="00:06:53.570" style="s2"> Maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.570" end="00:06:56.711" style="s2"> Keep your distance from the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.983" end="00:06:59.589" style="s2"> Especially to the God in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.589" end="00:07:01.253" style="s2"> Stay away</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.014" end="00:07:03.977" style="s2"> For Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:07.547" style="s2"> God originally wanted him to sacrifice his son</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.547" end="00:07:11.377" style="s2"> It turns out that God just made a joke with him</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.685" end="00:07:13.309" style="s2"> I&#39;m obviously shivering when I say this</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.309" end="00:07:16.638" style="s2"> But this does raise a question</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.275" end="00:07:21.795" style="s2"> What do you think of a god who would make such a request</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.630" end="00:07:23.893" style="s2"> Or vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.893" end="00:07:26.853" style="s2"> What do you think of Abraham, a man with similar hallucinations</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.853" end="00:07:32.734" style="s2"> In any case, the credibility of this story in the eyes of modern people</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.734" end="00:07:35.365" style="s2"> And the moral integrity of the Old Testament.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.365" end="00:07:37.541" style="s2"> These are some very bizarre stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.541" end="00:07:40.020" style="s2"> They often deviate from the appearance or are consistent</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.020" end="00:07:40.751" style="s2"> They have far-reaching connotations than appearances</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.162" end="00:07:45.292" style="s2"> Tonight we will talk a lot about sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.054" end="00:07:48.677" style="s2"> I always have my own ideas about sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.029" end="00:07:50.853" style="s2"> These thoughts are written in my book</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.991" end="00:07:55.354" style="s2"> In &quot;The Antidote to the Chaos of the Twelve Rules of Life&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.625" end="00:07:58.411" style="s2"> This book will be published in January I think I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.196" end="00:08:01.106" style="s2"> I am going to read the seventh rule</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.106" end="00:08:03.339" style="s2"> &quot;Go for something meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.339" end="00:08:05.195" style="s2"> The paragraph in &quot;not short-term benefits&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.563" end="00:08:09.874" style="s2"> This is what I have in the past three years</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.970" end="00:08:15.501" style="s2"> Some articles on the subject of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.169" end="00:08:19.363" style="s2"> Before reading this article, let me briefly introduce</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.856" end="00:08:23.215" style="s2"> It took me a long time to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.486" end="00:08:27.467" style="s2"> The meaning of sacrifice in the Old Testament is strange</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.467" end="00:08:28.363" style="s2"> But when I understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.363" end="00:08:29.771" style="s2"> The meaning seems to become obvious</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.771" end="00:08:31.513" style="s2"> It&#39;s the kind of feeling that suddenly realized</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.434" end="00:08:35.979" style="s2"> Because many times if you understand something correctly</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.979" end="00:08:38.923" style="s2"> As long as you understand it correctly it will be obvious</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.071" end="00:08:40.083" style="s2"> Then let&#39;s try it together</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.083" end="00:08:42.891" style="s2"> This method seems to work for me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.866" end="00:08:49.352" style="s2"> I used to just vaguely understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.483" end="00:08:53.131" style="s2"> Modern usage of the concept of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.131" end="00:08:55.073" style="s2"> Everyone actually understands the subject</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.073" end="00:08:58.465" style="s2"> If you want to make things better in the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.684" end="00:09:01.106" style="s2"> Then you have to make sacrifices now</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.755" end="00:09:04.971" style="s2"> Even your family needs to do this for generations</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.227" end="00:09:08.043" style="s2"> Especially when you are a good parent</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.613" end="00:09:14.530" style="s2"> I think immigration is a typical example, right</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.530" end="00:09:18.716" style="s2"> Immigrants often come from bad places</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.716" end="00:09:20.678" style="s2"> If they want to join a new community that is hostile to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:23.653" style="s2"> Often have to pay a huge price</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.945" end="00:09:25.963" style="s2"> They will have a hard life</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.471" end="00:09:29.499" style="s2"> They do this mainly to make their lives</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.780" end="00:09:31.659" style="s2"> And their children’s lives become better</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.659" end="00:09:33.413" style="s2"> Fortunately when they arrived in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.549" end="00:09:35.371" style="s2"> Compared to their hometown</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.371" end="00:09:36.651" style="s2"> Life really got better</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.651" end="00:09:39.211" style="s2"> The place where they came is worse but here is relatively better</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.211" end="00:09:40.747" style="s2"> Even so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.747" end="00:09:42.327" style="s2"> Immigrants still need to work hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.943" end="00:09:44.011" style="s2"> To regain a foothold</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.075" end="00:09:45.291" style="s2"> They must learn a new language</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.291" end="00:09:46.263" style="s2"> Embrace the influence of new culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.701" end="00:09:49.579" style="s2"> And face the fact that they are not part of the mainstream culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.579" end="00:09:52.567" style="s2"> Anyway, you should all have heard of such stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.985" end="00:09:56.299" style="s2"> So you make sacrifices for the future</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.299" end="00:09:58.283" style="s2"> The idea of ​​making sacrifices for your children</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.650" end="00:10:01.355" style="s2"> Everyone can understand this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.355" end="00:10:04.171" style="s2"> This is a sign of responsible maturity</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.171" end="00:10:06.691" style="s2"> It’s the performance of correctly shouldering the burden of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.129" end="00:10:10.052" style="s2"> If you discipline yourself, you will do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.052" end="00:10:12.747" style="s2"> In fact, this is almost the definition of self-discipline</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.747" end="00:10:15.563" style="s2"> Self-discipline means you have the ability to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.430" end="00:10:19.728" style="s2"> If you just do what you want to do more</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.728" end="00:10:21.210" style="s2"> You don’t have self-discipline instead of what you focus on</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.210" end="00:10:22.338" style="s2"> That&#39;s not self-discipline</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.818" end="00:10:24.523" style="s2"> If it works then that works</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.523" end="00:10:26.284" style="s2"> If you mix well in that way, that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.284" end="00:10:28.299" style="s2"> But this is still not self-discipline</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.299" end="00:10:30.762" style="s2"> Self-discipline is when you want to do something right away</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.430" end="00:10:35.417" style="s2"> You will think &quot;No, I have to delay my desire first&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.772" end="00:10:36.847" style="s2"> Maybe a permanent delay</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.254" end="00:10:40.375" style="s2"> Or at least in the medium to long term</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:43.083" style="s2"> You focus on what you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.083" end="00:10:45.515" style="s2"> Things that will produce results in the medium to long term</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.515" end="00:10:48.590" style="s2"> You look ahead and decide</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.645" end="00:10:53.236" style="s2"> Less satisfy today&#39;s impulse</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.236" end="00:10:56.377" style="s2"> You will make your future more reliable</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.377" end="00:10:56.962" style="s2"> More fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.108" end="00:10:59.081" style="s2"> And you really did it</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.659" end="00:11:00.939" style="s2"> But it is not easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.638" end="00:11:02.630" style="s2"> Last week we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.625" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2"> Adam and Eve&#39;s discovery of the future</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.883" end="00:11:11.755" style="s2"> And reveal the possibilities of the future</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.755" end="00:11:16.231" style="s2"> This includes the possibility of future tragedy and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.993" end="00:11:18.693" style="s2"> Is what we might</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.693" end="00:11:20.156" style="s2"> Recognition of the tragedy and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.156" end="00:11:20.271" style="s2"> Prompt us to make the sacrifice of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.271" end="00:11:24.619" style="s2"> Prompt us to make the sacrifice of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.619" end="00:11:27.755" style="s2"> So that we can reduce unnecessary anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.755" end="00:11:29.675" style="s2"> Uncertainty and pain</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.675" end="00:11:31.851" style="s2"> Admittedly this is a negative view</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.851" end="00:11:34.795" style="s2"> But we can also do this for some happiness</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.795" end="00:11:36.843" style="s2"> To make life better and so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.843" end="00:11:38.443" style="s2"> This is not a trivial matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.443" end="00:11:40.299" style="s2"> But the most fundamental problem is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.299" end="00:11:42.219" style="s2"> Especially when you have a baby</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.219" end="00:11:46.962" style="s2"> The most fundamental problem is to avoid pain, right</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.962" end="00:11:48.427" style="s2"> Everyone thinks so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.427" end="00:11:52.459" style="s2"> This is your first moral obligation</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.881" end="00:11:54.059" style="s2"> If you can at least recognize reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.059" end="00:11:55.584" style="s2"> This is your most important duty</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.054" end="00:11:58.601" style="s2"> So you will make the necessary sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.987" end="00:12:01.227" style="s2"> To create the future</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.075" end="00:12:07.046" style="s2"> The theme of sacrifice is found in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.025" end="00:12:09.958" style="s2"> But it&#39;s so real</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.678" end="00:12:13.067" style="s2"> So that it is difficult to compare between the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.067" end="00:12:16.459" style="s2"> It is not obvious to me that they are consistent</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.500" end="00:12:20.574" style="s2"> I don’t remember when I went to United Church when I was a child</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.741" end="00:12:22.411" style="s2"> During the very limited religious education</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.411" end="00:12:24.373" style="s2"> I always went to the United Church until I was 13</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.443" end="00:12:29.515" style="s2"> I don&#39;t remember anyone explained to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.515" end="00:12:33.163" style="s2"> The sacrifice of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.163" end="00:12:36.107" style="s2"> Or Abraham&#39;s attempted sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.107" end="00:12:38.726" style="s2"> Or is it the sacrifice of people to God</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.325" end="00:12:47.985" style="s2"> Is a dramatic sign, it heralds sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.400" end="00:12:53.027" style="s2"> Will become a psychological concept recognized by modern civilization</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.269" end="00:12:56.534" style="s2"> This is obvious as I said before</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.534" end="00:12:57.309" style="s2"> Once you put things in perspective, it will suddenly become clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.557" end="00:12:59.577" style="s2"> No one explained these things to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.730" end="00:13:01.638" style="s2"> I&#39;d better read the book</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.223" end="00:13:03.929" style="s2"> I just finished introducing this matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.929" end="00:13:07.056" style="s2"> &quot;With the development of mankind, these things happened</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.217" end="00:13:11.801" style="s2"> &quot;First of all, before written history and drama</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.254" end="00:13:16.586" style="s2"> &quot;That tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.077" end="00:13:21.336" style="s2"> &quot;Delay and exchange behaviors began to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.529" end="00:13:22.474" style="s2"> &quot;And this process is slow and painful.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.873" end="00:13:24.728" style="s2"> There is a cool psychology study</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.625" end="00:13:27.673" style="s2"> This is called the &quot;marshmallow test&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.569" end="00:13:30.809" style="s2"> Is it a reliable study?</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.043" end="00:13:33.177" style="s2"> Although it was done by social psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.561" end="00:13:34.905" style="s2"> This experiment should be reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.025" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2"> Is a good study</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.674" end="00:13:39.885" style="s2"> You choose some kids</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.885" end="00:13:42.969" style="s2"> Take to a room</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.969" end="00:13:45.593" style="s2"> Then put what they want in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.593" end="00:13:47.001" style="s2"> Like a marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.181" end="00:13:50.393" style="s2"> Then you basically start to &quot;torture&quot; them</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.393" end="00:13:52.633" style="s2"> You said, &quot;Did you see that cotton candy?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.761" end="00:13:55.031" style="s2"> The child will think &quot;Yes, I saw cotton candy&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.025" end="00:13:58.777" style="s2"> You say, &quot;You can eat marshmallows now</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.686" end="00:14:00.428" style="s2"> &quot;Or if you wait a minute&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:03.006" style="s2"> I remember the experiment stipulated ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.081" end="00:14:05.261" style="s2"> &quot;You can eat two marshmallows.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.357" end="00:14:08.590" style="s2"> This presents a problem for the children</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.488" end="00:14:10.890" style="s2"> They are required to use</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.890" end="00:14:13.893" style="s2"> An actual concrete tangible marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.415" end="00:14:17.265" style="s2"> To exchange two imaginary future marshmallows</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.423" end="00:14:20.234" style="s2"> Imagine the reality of a hypothetical future</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.234" end="00:14:21.826" style="s2"> And the reality in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.213" end="00:14:24.718" style="s2"> Has the same tangible meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.162" end="00:14:27.860" style="s2"> Not an easy task</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.236" end="00:14:30.396" style="s2"> It&#39;s amazing that people can do this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.140" end="00:14:33.546" style="s2"> Then the experimenter left</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.546" end="00:14:37.642" style="s2"> Some kids grab the marshmallow and eat it</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.538" end="00:14:40.584" style="s2"> There are some children, they recorded the children</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.899" end="00:14:43.786" style="s2"> The children began to show different reactions after they left</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.786" end="00:14:45.706" style="s2"> They whistled and looked at the ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.706" end="00:14:47.178" style="s2"> Sitting on one&#39;s hands</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.178" end="00:14:48.298" style="s2"> They try to distract themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.298" end="00:14:49.812" style="s2"> Of course they will stare at the marshmallows from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.177" end="00:14:51.795" style="s2"> Like a squirrel staring at a nut</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.369" end="00:14:55.897" style="s2"> They will try to restrain themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.972" end="00:15:01.322" style="s2"> This reminds me of the child’s prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.322" end="00:15:02.794" style="s2"> This higher cortical system</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.794" end="00:15:06.186" style="s2"> Is at war with the underlying motivation system</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.186" end="00:15:08.298" style="s2"> Those who control things like hunger</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.298" end="00:15:09.962" style="s2"> More primitive motivation system</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.962" end="00:15:11.983" style="s2"> Hunger system hypothalamic system</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.983" end="00:15:15.650" style="s2"> Would say, &quot;There are some high-fat and high-sugar things right in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.650" end="00:15:17.025" style="s2"> &quot;Act now</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.025" end="00:15:19.178" style="s2"> &quot;Grab that thing and put it in your mouth.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.384" end="00:15:21.388" style="s2"> I believe many of you often</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.388" end="00:15:22.588" style="s2"> Because whether to eat something high in fat and sugar</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.890" end="00:15:25.021" style="s2"> And fight with the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.271" end="00:15:26.602" style="s2"> And often lose</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.805" end="00:15:29.906" style="s2"> So you may be able to see the situation of those children firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.314" end="00:15:35.562" style="s2"> The hypothalamus has very powerful tendrils</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.562" end="00:15:37.034" style="s2"> Implant the brain deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.290" end="00:15:40.428" style="s2"> Enter the part that is mainly responsible for our autonomous control</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.730" end="00:15:44.906" style="s2"> The autonomous control center has some small weak ribbons</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.906" end="00:15:46.910" style="s2"> Downward control of the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.484" end="00:15:50.772" style="s2"> If you know something about neuroanatomy</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.096" end="00:15:52.778" style="s2"> Can easily understand that at the critical moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.778" end="00:15:53.528" style="s2"> Which part is controlling</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.994" end="00:15:56.746" style="s2"> For children to learn to control</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.746" end="00:15:58.922" style="s2"> Those underlying primitive impulses are not easy</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.922" end="00:16:00.906" style="s2"> These impulses are born</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.906" end="00:16:02.250" style="s2"> We share with animals</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.609" end="00:16:05.642" style="s2"> But the kids will control and it’s cool</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.242" end="00:16:08.330" style="s2"> This was discovered by Walter Michel</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.330" end="00:16:09.482" style="s2"> Is the research he did</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.925" end="00:16:13.322" style="s2"> He found that for those in the marshmallow test</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.322" end="00:16:15.434" style="s2"> For children who can postpone satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.434" end="00:16:18.506" style="s2"> Their long-term human generation is better than those</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.506" end="00:16:22.218" style="s2"> Children who ate marshmallows impulsively and immediately had much more positive results</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.730" end="00:16:24.202" style="s2"> This is &quot;delayed gratification&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.457" end="00:16:28.106" style="s2"> This is probably related to responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.234" end="00:16:32.808" style="s2"> Although this specific connection has not yet been determined</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.808" end="00:16:35.914" style="s2"> But they look very similar in concept</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.071" end="00:16:42.808" style="s2"> Anyway, this situation may occur in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.133" end="00:16:46.597" style="s2"> It’s almost like this for two to four year olds</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.098" end="00:16:48.906" style="s2"> They should be prepared before the age of four</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.970" end="00:16:50.271" style="s2"> Because for them</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.388" end="00:16:53.215" style="s2"> Learn not to delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.215" end="00:16:55.689" style="s2"> It’s difficult to interact well with other children</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.033" end="00:16:57.674" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.674" end="00:16:58.611" style="s2"> No other kids will like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.820" end="00:17:01.770" style="s2"> Because you will be arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.770" end="00:17:02.538" style="s2"> You need to be satisfied immediately</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.954" end="00:17:05.162" style="s2"> And you lose your temper easily</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.162" end="00:17:07.210" style="s2"> In short you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.210" end="00:17:08.246" style="s2"> Self-control to get along with others happily</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.706" end="00:17:12.995" style="s2"> You can see this in children, it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.267" end="00:17:15.146" style="s2"> Not only that when the behavior of satisfying the delay first appears</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.313" end="00:17:18.371" style="s2"> It heralds positive long-term results</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.590" end="00:17:20.981" style="s2"> By the way, the responsibility trait has the same effect</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.430" end="00:17:24.770" style="s2"> In western culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.428" end="00:17:27.338" style="s2"> Responsibility is the second major factor for long-term success</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.204" end="00:17:29.994" style="s2"> It is second only to intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.058" end="00:17:31.242" style="s2"> In our society</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.952" end="00:17:33.642" style="s2"> Those who have done the best in all periods</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.642" end="00:17:35.866" style="s2"> Those who work hard with high IQ</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.618" end="00:17:38.250" style="s2"> I want to say I think this phenomenon is pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.624" end="00:17:40.407" style="s2"> how to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.586" end="00:17:43.306" style="s2"> It&#39;s an illustration</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.306" end="00:17:44.655" style="s2"> It can prove that our culture is positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.655" end="00:17:47.536" style="s2"> I think you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:50.396" style="s2"> If this system is truly elite-led</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.856" end="00:17:51.482" style="s2"> And it should be so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.482" end="00:17:54.378" style="s2"> And you want to learn from people who are more effective in contributing</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.378" end="00:17:56.611" style="s2"> If you get resources there</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.515" end="00:17:59.498" style="s2"> Then what you want to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.498" end="00:18:01.546" style="s2"> Let those who work hard and smart have a better life</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.675" end="00:18:05.169" style="s2"> Everyone can live better because of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.449" end="00:18:05.824" style="s2"> I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.735" end="00:18:08.173" style="s2"> anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.353" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2"> You can see the ability to delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:11.056" style="s2"> Is developed in the children</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.106" end="00:18:13.580" style="s2"> &quot;At first before written history and drama appeared</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.632" end="00:18:16.169" style="s2"> &quot;Humanity has more than 100,000 years of history.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.586" end="00:18:19.885" style="s2"> &quot;Delay and exchange the twin behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.375" end="00:18:21.482" style="s2"> &quot;Begin to appear slowly and painfully&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.993" end="00:18:25.156" style="s2"> &quot;Then they are expressed in a metaphysical abstract form</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.231" end="00:18:28.048" style="s2"> &quot;Such as rituals and sacrificial legends&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.133" end="00:18:33.507" style="s2"> &quot;Like there is a powerful character in the sky judging you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.998" end="00:18:36.430" style="s2"> &quot;You better please him or be cautious in your words and deeds.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.714" end="00:18:40.710" style="s2"> &quot;We have been observing ourselves for a long time with God.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.981" end="00:18:41.806" style="s2"> &quot;When you give up what you treasure</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.806" end="00:18:43.622" style="s2"> &quot;He seems to be happy&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.801" end="00:18:47.870" style="s2"> &quot;So practice sharing and sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.246" end="00:18:49.676" style="s2"> &quot;Until you know it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.837" end="00:18:53.319" style="s2"> &quot;No one really said this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.893" end="00:18:57.714" style="s2"> It’s been a long time, even if someone said something similar</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.975" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2"> &quot;But these views are implicit in the action</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:00.710" style="s2"> &quot;Hidden in the story&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:05.167" style="s2"> &quot;Action first, implicit first&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.542" end="00:19:11.336" style="s2"> &quot;People observe these successes and failures</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.931" end="00:19:13.611" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s been thousands of years.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.716" end="00:19:16.304" style="s2"> &quot;We think twice and come to a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.753" end="00:19:19.822" style="s2"> &quot;Successful among us will make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.041" end="00:19:23.277" style="s2"> &quot;Successful among us will delay enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.263" end="00:19:28.392" style="s2"> &quot;Successful among us will play against the future&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.415" end="00:19:31.513" style="s2"> &quot;A great idea&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.265" end="00:19:34.165" style="s2"> &quot;Gradually formed in an unprecedented form.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.125" end="00:19:38.110" style="s2"> &quot;The idea is the key to a long and profound story.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.555" end="00:19:42.860" style="s2"> &quot;It is the moral of this story.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.958" end="00:19:47.599" style="s2"> I want to make a foreshadowing here</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.238" end="00:19:52.599" style="s2"> &quot;What is the difference between successful and unsuccessful&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.069" end="00:19:54.540" style="s2"> &quot;Successful people will make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.284" end="00:20:00.730" style="s2"> &quot;After they make sacrifices, things will get better.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.973" end="00:20:08.110" style="s2"> &quot;The problem has become more precise but also broader.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.958" end="00:20:12.296" style="s2"> &quot;What is for the greatest good</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:14.144" style="s2"> &quot;The greatest sacrifice ever made.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:18.476" style="s2"> If you ask for this purpose</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.914" end="00:20:19.885" style="s2"> Maybe there will be a moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.885" end="00:20:23.580" style="s2"> You can’t make it more precise and broad</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.012" end="00:20:28.904" style="s2"> At this moment this question is in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.904" end="00:20:30.177" style="s2"> Or maybe even the answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.208" end="00:20:31.158" style="s2"> Became a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:35.396" style="s2"> Become a prototype because it can no longer be optimized</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.273" end="00:20:38.674" style="s2"> In a sense it seems to be the ultimate problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.674" end="00:20:41.931" style="s2"> How could it be possible to ask a broader question?</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.048" end="00:20:44.426" style="s2"> Assumed initial preset</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.426" end="00:20:45.856" style="s2"> You have to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.856" end="00:20:48.403" style="s2"> Then the logical end point will look like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.403" end="00:20:49.895" style="s2"> Good you have to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.895" end="00:20:51.659" style="s2"> That for the greatest good</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.442" end="00:20:54.071" style="s2"> And what is the greatest sacrifice made</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.509" end="00:20:55.271" style="s2"> This is a good question</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.085" end="00:20:58.956" style="s2"> &quot;The answer will become profound.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.979" end="00:21:01.325" style="s2"> &quot;God in the traditional sense of the West</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.680" end="00:21:05.052" style="s2"> &quot;Similar to other gods that require sacrifice.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.302" end="00:21:06.503" style="s2"> &quot;We have explored the reason.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.503" end="00:21:08.872" style="s2"> &quot;But sometimes God’s requirements are even higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.041" end="00:21:13.434" style="s2"> &quot;High enough to require you to sacrifice your favorite.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.520" end="00:21:15.282" style="s2"> &quot;That&#39;s why&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.659" end="00:21:20.511" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s also another major human discovery.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.737" end="00:21:25.365" style="s2"> &quot;Sometimes things don&#39;t go well&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.783" end="00:21:26.900" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s obvious and ordinary.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.202" end="00:21:28.152" style="s2"> &quot;But there is a contradiction.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.426" end="00:21:31.211" style="s2"> &quot;Sometimes when things get blocked</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.659" end="00:21:36.795" style="s2"> &quot;The obstacle to this matter happens to be the most cherished thing.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.739" end="00:21:42.317" style="s2"> &quot;Why because the world is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.912" end="00:21:44.227" style="s2"> &quot;Shown with your values ​​as a template&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.227" end="00:21:47.568" style="s2"> &quot;If the world you see is not what you want</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.568" end="00:21:50.877" style="s2"> &quot;At this time you should reflect on your values.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.419" end="00:21:54.906" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s time to pull yourself out of the current assumptions.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.012" end="00:21:58.904" style="s2"> I believe that in this lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.904" end="00:22:00.543" style="s2"> I have mentioned a famous experiment many times</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.284" end="00:22:02.839" style="s2"> The &quot;Invisible Gorilla&quot; experiment</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.570" end="00:22:08.361" style="s2"> In the &quot;Invisible Gorilla&quot; experiment, there are two teams of players</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.455" end="00:22:10.021" style="s2"> Three members per team</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.052" end="00:22:12.348" style="s2"> A team in black and a team in white</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.776" end="00:22:16.680" style="s2"> Each team passes each other within the team</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.785" end="00:22:17.714" style="s2"> And it&#39;s all around</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.540" end="00:22:21.148" style="s2"> You can watch videos of their experiments</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.148" end="00:22:22.922" style="s2"> They almost filled the whole shot</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.747" end="00:22:26.920" style="s2"> The white team passes the ball to the white team member</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.150" end="00:22:30.177" style="s2"> The black team passes the ball to the black team member</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.263" end="00:22:34.457" style="s2"> Your task for this experiment</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.687" end="00:22:36.221" style="s2"> Is clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.618" end="00:22:42.317" style="s2"> Number of passes of black team members</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.369" end="00:22:43.016" style="s2"> This is what you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.100" end="00:22:46.659" style="s2"> At this time you have to pursue goals and values</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.421" end="00:22:50.052" style="s2"> Pursuing goals and values ​​at this time are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.271" end="00:22:51.983" style="s2"> Is to complete this task</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.098" end="00:22:54.979" style="s2"> This is very cool very cool</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.979" end="00:22:59.874" style="s2"> This fact is incredible</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.501" end="00:23:04.540" style="s2"> Like a complete verification of an element in the Buddhist worldview</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.294" end="00:23:08.215" style="s2"> They pass the ball</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.904" end="00:23:11.252" style="s2"> The experimenter asked you how many times</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.252" end="00:23:14.467" style="s2"> You said 15 times that you are happy</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.603" end="00:23:15.856" style="s2"> Because you are focused</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.336" end="00:23:18.163" style="s2"> The experimenter said it was good</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.163" end="00:23:19.582" style="s2"> Maybe it’s not that you may have missed one</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.083" end="00:23:21.451" style="s2"> Then the experimenter will say</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.555" end="00:23:22.693" style="s2"> So did you see that gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.818" end="00:23:24.300" style="s2"> Half of the people would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.624" end="00:23:28.538" style="s2"> What gorilla is kidding</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.998" end="00:23:33.079" style="s2"> The experimenter said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He rewinds and replays</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.549" end="00:23:36.179" style="s2"> About half of the three-minute video</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.451" end="00:23:39.593" style="s2"> There is indeed a man who is 1.9 meters tall</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.094" end="00:23:41.565" style="s2"> Walked into the camera in a gorilla suit</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.254" end="00:23:45.960" style="s2"> He stands in the middle of the playing field</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.565" end="00:23:48.079" style="s2"> Almost as tall as other players</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.528" end="00:23:51.555" style="s2"> Extremely eye-catching and unobtrusive</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.920" end="00:23:54.363" style="s2"> He beat his chest for about a second and a half</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.833" end="00:23:56.263" style="s2"> Then he swaggered down</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.317" end="00:24:01.388" style="s2"> At that time, half of the people did not see this gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.839" end="00:24:04.520" style="s2"> This is really shocking</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.520" end="00:24:06.701" style="s2"> It illustrates your quest</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.701" end="00:24:08.528" style="s2"> Will make you invisible to the essence of reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.833" end="00:24:11.743" style="s2"> Your pursuit will give you an insight into some of the reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.849" end="00:24:14.666" style="s2"> And ignore most of the rest of the reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.666" end="00:24:15.344" style="s2"> This is normal</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.344" end="00:24:16.002" style="s2"> Because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.014" end="00:24:18.476" style="s2"> In a sense most of you can’t</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.476" end="00:24:20.971" style="s2"> You are a very focused creature like a laser beam</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.346" end="00:24:23.789" style="s2"> So I can’t pay attention to everything all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.603" end="00:24:27.348" style="s2"> But once you realize a problem you will ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.348" end="00:24:31.378" style="s2"> If you feel miserable then there is a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.150" end="00:24:35.929" style="s2"> That is, you may be too focused on one point</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.160" end="00:24:42.442" style="s2"> So that your focus may be entirely around</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.442" end="00:24:45.396" style="s2"> &quot;Why are things so bad?&quot; The question comes up</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.524" end="00:24:47.390" style="s2"> But it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.474" end="00:24:49.895" style="s2"> Because life is so random</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.730" end="00:24:53.758" style="s2"> You will suffer even when you don’t deserve it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.758" end="00:24:56.106" style="s2"> This looks like a story from &quot;Job&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.367" end="00:24:59.123" style="s2"> Job is a good man but God made a bet with Satan</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.123" end="00:25:01.597" style="s2"> This seems to be another vicious act</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.941" end="00:25:03.257" style="s2"> Torture Job</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.778" end="00:25:05.334" style="s2"> Satan did a great job</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.075" end="00:25:08.841" style="s2"> I want to see if Job will disobey God</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.687" end="00:25:14.092" style="s2"> This seems to be very interesting to God</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.353" end="00:25:18.465" style="s2"> But the point is that even in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.538" end="00:25:20.971" style="s2"> There are also ample signs</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.971" end="00:25:23.883" style="s2"> Sometimes people are devastated and bruised</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.520" end="00:25:28.810" style="s2"> Even if they have good conduct and high ambitions</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.810" end="00:25:30.156" style="s2"> Life is still a bit random</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.173" end="00:25:39.206" style="s2"> What may hurt you is what you are attached to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.916" end="00:25:42.829" style="s2"> It may even be the thing you are most attached to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.912" end="00:25:43.737" style="s2"> Will hurt you the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.820" end="00:25:45.407" style="s2"> This is most likely the person you love</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.584" end="00:25:47.703" style="s2"> Many times when I give people a psychological diagnosis and treatment</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.745" end="00:25:50.010" style="s2"> They suffer for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.553" end="00:25:56.284" style="s2"> Sometimes just because of a bad relationship with close family members</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.463" end="00:26:01.378" style="s2"> In short, their family members</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.659" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2"> I don’t really want to lead them to a good life</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.626" end="00:26:07.108" style="s2"> Instead, these family members</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.108" end="00:26:09.154" style="s2"> But want to bring them in</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.154" end="00:26:11.847" style="s2"> In the most tragic situation possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.196" end="00:26:20.209" style="s2"> And maliciously use kinship to fulfill their wishes</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.626" end="00:26:24.791" style="s2"> So sometimes necessary sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.791" end="00:26:31.993" style="s2"> Not only to keep a physical distance from that person</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.004" end="00:26:35.219" style="s2"> And sometimes seriously alienating those people</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.365" end="00:26:38.142" style="s2"> Such as old and dead</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.290" end="00:26:42.046" style="s2"> It&#39;s really hard and painful</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.382" end="00:26:46.680" style="s2"> But this is also a very good example</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.680" end="00:26:51.492" style="s2"> It shows that sometimes in order to never fall into</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.492" end="00:26:54.666" style="s2"> Withdraw from pain and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.209" end="00:26:57.077" style="s2"> You must give up your beloved</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.227" end="00:27:01.409" style="s2"> &quot;If the world you see is not what you want</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.733" end="00:27:03.893" style="s2"> &quot;Then you need to reflect on your own values.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.426" end="00:27:07.161" style="s2"> I need to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.161" end="00:27:09.561" style="s2"> Because its other option is to curse fate</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.302" end="00:27:13.215" style="s2"> If it&#39;s not your problem, you can&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.215" end="00:27:14.895" style="s2"> Because you didn&#39;t do anything wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.261" end="00:27:18.685" style="s2"> Then the problem lies with Destiny World and others</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.695" end="00:27:20.522" style="s2"> The reason is that these are all parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.522" end="00:27:22.035" style="s2"> In other words, the problem lies in the nature of the world itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.380" end="00:27:23.935" style="s2"> Or the problem lies in &quot;God&quot; itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.332" end="00:27:27.662" style="s2"> This god can be any god you believe or not</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.662" end="00:27:29.394" style="s2"> Because no matter what kind of faith you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.728" end="00:27:31.785" style="s2"> Will encounter the situation I described</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.277" end="00:27:34.749" style="s2"> There is a very interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.749" end="00:27:37.453" style="s2"> I mentioned before about the Israelites in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.453" end="00:27:41.430" style="s2"> They understand this is not trivial</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.254" end="00:27:44.781" style="s2"> In the Old Testament the Israelites over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.781" end="00:27:48.653" style="s2"> The magic of being complacent</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.653" end="00:27:50.365" style="s2"> Immediately afterwards committed a moral error</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.365" end="00:27:51.325" style="s2"> Because they are proud and complacent</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.795" end="00:27:54.614" style="s2"> Then God split them to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.760" end="00:27:56.701" style="s2"> Cycle after generation</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.077" end="00:27:59.499" style="s2"> They got up tremblingly</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.989" end="00:28:01.753" style="s2"> But has always maintained the same attitude</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.753" end="00:28:05.031" style="s2"> &quot;We made a mistake, we made a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.302" end="00:28:09.311" style="s2"> This leads to an axiom instead of observation</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.321" end="00:28:14.948" style="s2"> That is, &quot;If things are not shown as they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.177" end="00:28:16.910" style="s2"> &quot;Then we should not curse God</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.213" end="00:28:18.852" style="s2"> &quot;I should reflect on myself&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.261" end="00:28:22.098" style="s2"> You will ask why not curse God</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.309" end="00:28:24.405" style="s2"> Because it might also be his fault</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.355" end="00:28:26.409" style="s2"> This is a good question</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.348" end="00:28:31.378" style="s2"> I have been thinking about this problem for 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.087" end="00:28:33.559" style="s2"> Why not curse god</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.559" end="00:28:36.325" style="s2"> Because existence is arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.325" end="00:28:40.845" style="s2"> Moreover, we are fragile and unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.991" end="00:28:42.025" style="s2"> This is all the problem right</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.025" end="00:28:45.960" style="s2"> There are unjust, unfair and endless suffering in the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.367" end="00:28:48.006" style="s2"> Why not blame God for all this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.925" end="00:28:51.931" style="s2"> Regardless of whether God exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.620" end="00:28:56.106" style="s2"> This has nothing to do with the metaphysical elements on this issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.440" end="00:28:58.465" style="s2"> The conclusion remains the same regardless of whether God exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.175" end="00:29:01.263" style="s2"> I can say the answer is still</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.284" end="00:29:05.814" style="s2"> &quot;If you don’t want to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.190" end="00:29:11.534" style="s2"> &quot;Trying to give responsibility to society or beings themselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.910" end="00:29:16.430" style="s2"> &quot;That is to make things worse and worse.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.025" end="00:29:18.820" style="s2"> &quot;Not only to you but to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.820" end="00:29:20.469" style="s2"> &quot;It may even be to the being itself.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.474" end="00:29:23.893" style="s2"> It&#39;s useless</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.822" end="00:29:27.526" style="s2"> If you think it&#39;s your problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.526" end="00:29:28.580" style="s2"> The problem is with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.789" end="00:29:29.916" style="s2"> Maybe this is not true at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.916" end="00:29:34.457" style="s2"> Maybe you are the one tortured by God and Satan</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.666" end="00:29:37.035" style="s2"> If this is the case, you are unlucky</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.401" end="00:29:43.538" style="s2"> But this is still applicable to a human being</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:48.685" style="s2"> People need to stand on their own feet</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.238" end="00:29:51.691" style="s2"> Have the courage to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.192" end="00:29:55.167" style="s2"> No matter how opposed</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.814" end="00:29:56.920" style="s2"> This is really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.945" end="00:30:01.576" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s time to pull yourself out of the current assumptions.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.576" end="00:30:04.029" style="s2"> I see it as a &quot;rotten wood problem&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.447" end="00:30:09.384" style="s2"> Think about the subject of Phoenix</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.209" end="00:30:11.900" style="s2"> I remember when Harry Potter went to war</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.693" end="00:30:14.530" style="s2"> Like a saint george going to war</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.470" end="00:30:16.221" style="s2"> What&#39;s that thing called</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.263" end="00:30:18.549" style="s2"> Basilisk, your eyes will be turned into stone as long as you touch him</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.549" end="00:30:20.198" style="s2"> This is the dragon for all intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.292" end="00:30:21.618" style="s2"> It&#39;s watching the virgin</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.265" end="00:30:24.123" style="s2"> What&#39;s her name? It&#39;s not &quot;Virginia&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.520" end="00:30:26.545" style="s2"> But is it called &quot;Ginny&quot; that is closer?</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.555" end="00:30:29.332" style="s2"> A variant of the word &quot;Ginny Fla&quot; and &quot;Virgin&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.415" end="00:30:30.741" style="s2"> It is also a variant of the word &quot;Virginia&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.566" end="00:30:36.628" style="s2"> When Harry Potter was bitten and poisoned by this dragon</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.348" end="00:30:38.852" style="s2"> This is the dragon of chaos right</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.248" end="00:30:41.158" style="s2"> When you look at this dragon, it will petrify</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.158" end="00:30:43.935" style="s2"> When he was bitten and dying</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.687" end="00:30:46.837" style="s2"> Also if you are bitten by something</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.837" end="00:30:49.259" style="s2"> If it turns into stone at a glance</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.259" end="00:30:51.858" style="s2"> If you&#39;re not dead, you&#39;re better than dead</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.910" end="00:30:52.651" style="s2"> This is one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.173" end="00:30:54.572" style="s2"> Then the phoenix flew in</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.885" end="00:30:56.931" style="s2"> It poured tears into the wound and healed him</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.150" end="00:30:58.267" style="s2"> Phoenix this creature</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.789" end="00:31:04.342" style="s2"> You can let the deadwood burn out every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.342" end="00:31:06.566" style="s2"> I think the phoenix is ​​reborn every 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.952" end="00:31:08.194" style="s2"> Of course it&#39;s very dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.194" end="00:31:10.135" style="s2"> This bird needs to nirvana in flames</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.135" end="00:31:11.920" style="s2"> Then there is only one egg left</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.307" end="00:31:14.175" style="s2"> But there is also a very serious message</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.175" end="00:31:20.209" style="s2"> In a sense you can compare yourself to a forest</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:23.914" style="s2"> The forest burns every now and then to clean up the dead wood</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.206" end="00:31:26.994" style="s2"> Only in this way can the forest stay long</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.994" end="00:31:30.563" style="s2"> If you don’t let the forest burn for a long time,</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.563" end="00:31:31.837" style="s2"> Like it happened in the U.S.</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.578" end="00:31:34.927" style="s2"> Especially when their forest fire control is too strict</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.250" end="00:31:37.620" style="s2"> The result is a large accumulation of deadwood</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.620" end="00:31:40.678" style="s2"> Accumulate less and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.294" end="00:31:43.361" style="s2"> Until the whole forest is covered with deadwood</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.810" end="00:31:47.046" style="s2"> Then he was struck by lightning</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.797" end="00:31:50.386" style="s2"> Finally turned into a piece of scorched earth</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.065" end="00:31:52.328" style="s2"> This is a valuable moral lesson</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.338" end="00:31:56.158" style="s2"> That is, don’t wait for too much deadwood to pile up before burning</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.816" end="00:32:00.292" style="s2"> Maybe let the forest burn itself a small amount every day</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.292" end="00:32:03.799" style="s2"> It’s only burned once more than 20 years.</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.133" end="00:32:05.929" style="s2"> In the end, there is nothing left</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.929" end="00:32:08.403" style="s2"> Because maybe this will leave you with nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.311" end="00:32:11.044" style="s2"> But things often happen to people</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.044" end="00:32:13.267" style="s2"> Commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.893" end="00:32:16.722" style="s2"> The deadwood accumulates and it will be a mess around it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.764" end="00:32:18.831" style="s2"> Unresolved chaos will add up</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.259" end="00:32:20.991" style="s2"> One day a spark will appear</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.991" end="00:32:23.246" style="s2"> The power of a prairie prairie can be described as devastating</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.392" end="00:32:25.897" style="s2"> By then it will be too late</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.096" end="00:32:30.783" style="s2"> They are the ones eaten by dragons</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.783" end="00:32:32.108" style="s2"> Was swallowed into the dragon&#39;s belly</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.108" end="00:32:34.154" style="s2"> This is another common prototype theme</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.177" end="00:32:37.192" style="s2"> Or there will be a hero to save them</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.192" end="00:32:38.946" style="s2"> Or they will stay in their belly</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.530" end="00:32:41.566" style="s2"> This is the sign of &quot;hell&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.973" end="00:32:43.622" style="s2"> I don&#39;t recommend doing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.144" end="00:32:46.138" style="s2"> So prevent the slightest failure</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.753" end="00:32:53.904" style="s2"> Much better than sporadic unexpected changes</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.023" end="00:32:58.403" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s time to pull yourself out of the current assumptions.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.403" end="00:32:59.572" style="s2"> One more thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.712" end="00:33:06.785" style="s2"> Solzhenitsyn said when he wrote about the Soviet Union and its morbidity</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.434" end="00:33:11.472" style="s2"> &quot;When its pathological totalitarianism reached its peak</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.847" end="00:33:16.357" style="s2"> &quot;It is illegal to complain about your bad life.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.994" end="00:33:18.695" style="s2"> You think about how scary this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.789" end="00:33:22.818" style="s2"> Because it’s not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.839" end="00:33:25.480" style="s2"> And I’m not referring to casual situations</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.563" end="00:33:27.870" style="s2"> I&#39;m talking about, for example, you have diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.204" end="00:33:31.336" style="s2"> Facing a serious situation like amputation</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.941" end="00:33:34.989" style="s2"> This is not a trivial matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.083" end="00:33:36.117" style="s2"> This is a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.764" end="00:33:39.165" style="s2"> For another example, you may be unemployed at the economic level</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.396" end="00:33:42.662" style="s2"> But you see what the Soviet Union did</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.236" end="00:33:44.895" style="s2"> &quot;We already have the answer&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.563" end="00:33:47.619" style="s2"> &quot;Everything is perfect&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.622" end="00:33:49.937" style="s2"> This is a totalitarian idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.522" end="00:33:54.854" style="s2"> &quot;If everything is perfect and you are suffering&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.511" end="00:33:58.225" style="s2"> &quot;Then the problem may be with you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.217" end="00:34:01.983" style="s2"> After all everything is perfect and you are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.192" end="00:34:02.577" style="s2"> What should you do</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.577" end="00:34:03.779" style="s2"> Stand up and say you are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.394" end="00:34:07.150" style="s2"> Then you are proof that the facts are not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.808" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2"> You are like the widower and orphan in the Old Testament story</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:13.330" style="s2"> When the throne is high</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.956" end="00:34:15.824" style="s2"> I don’t care about widowers and orphans</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.824" end="00:34:18.371" style="s2"> Then the prophet came out and said</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.371" end="00:34:22.056" style="s2"> &quot;These widowers orphans are far more important than you think.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.056" end="00:34:23.987" style="s2"> &quot;If you don’t give proper attention</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.979" end="00:34:26.096" style="s2"> &quot;Then things around you will</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.096" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2"> &quot;Fall apart in a way you didn&#39;t expect&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.133" end="00:34:31.430" style="s2"> You are like your own widower and orphan</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.430" end="00:34:32.307" style="s2"> But you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.307" end="00:34:34.008" style="s2"> See things are not perfect yet</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.008" end="00:34:36.743" style="s2"> Because I still suffer here</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.954" end="00:34:39.718" style="s2"> Then you can&#39;t admit that you are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:44.572" style="s2"> If you don’t admit that you are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.365" end="00:34:49.509" style="s2"> Pain especially excessive pain</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.509" end="00:34:51.357" style="s2"> Should be seen as an evidence</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.357" end="00:34:53.841" style="s2"> Prove that you did something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.668" end="00:34:58.069" style="s2"> This should be regarded as proof that you have made a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.071" end="00:35:01.493" style="s2"> There is a problem with something big you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.733" end="00:35:03.653" style="s2"> I know it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.019" end="00:35:06.566" style="s2"> It’s not that some people are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.566" end="00:35:10.219" style="s2"> Suffering because they are doing something wrong with some simple methods</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.584" end="00:35:13.173" style="s2"> I was in the elevator of the hospital once</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.716" end="00:35:14.906" style="s2"> It&#39;s a terrible experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.845" end="00:35:16.889" style="s2"> Came in alone</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.889" end="00:35:18.946" style="s2"> Completely panicked</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.906" end="00:35:22.108" style="s2"> It must be bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.893" end="00:35:25.010" style="s2"> I forgot how to speak</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.010" end="00:35:26.827" style="s2"> Anyway, I exchanged a few words with him</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.307" end="00:35:29.551" style="s2"> He said he had just been diagnosed as</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.770" end="00:35:31.284" style="s2"> Suspected advanced cancer</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.058" end="00:35:38.465" style="s2"> The scary thing is that he began to look back on his life in the elevator</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.810" end="00:35:41.691" style="s2"> I want to find out what evil he did to suffer this disaster</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.004" end="00:35:44.958" style="s2"> He soon blamed this on his own moral corruption</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.261" end="00:35:46.451" style="s2"> That was not what I meant</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.451" end="00:35:49.447" style="s2"> You can&#39;t say to a person with cancer</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.447" end="00:35:51.921" style="s2"> If you haven&#39;t lived so stupidly in your life</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.921" end="00:35:52.870" style="s2"> You won&#39;t get cancer</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.870" end="00:35:54.728" style="s2"> Believe me, things like this are more common than you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.073" end="00:35:57.463" style="s2"> The severely ill person is blamed</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.662" end="00:35:58.622" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.737" end="00:35:59.791" style="s2"> That&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.605" end="00:36:02.422" style="s2"> The more general attitude should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.547" end="00:36:05.835" style="s2"> If life is still not satisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.835" end="00:36:09.227" style="s2"> Then your first responsibility is to act on it</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.227" end="00:36:15.031" style="s2"> Reflect on your mistakes and change the past</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.841" end="00:36:20.188" style="s2"> This is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.250" end="00:36:23.559" style="s2"> Because maybe you are doing unnecessary things</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.559" end="00:36:25.376" style="s2"> Things will get better if you solve them</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.701" end="00:36:27.557" style="s2"> &quot;Let down</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.557" end="00:36:31.284" style="s2"> &quot;Sacrifice the present to create the future&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.052" end="00:36:46.764" style="s2"> &quot;There is an old story about catching monkeys&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.891" end="00:36:51.117" style="s2"> Maybe someone here is interested in catching monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.367" end="00:36:52.985" style="s2"> Now you have a chance to learn</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.789" end="00:36:57.265" style="s2"> First you have to find a large narrow-necked jar</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.236" end="00:37:02.223" style="s2"> The top diameter only needs to be enough for him to put the monkey paw in</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.620" end="00:37:04.353" style="s2"> Then install half of the stone</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.426" end="00:37:06.054" style="s2"> This way the monkey can&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.409" end="00:37:09.342" style="s2"> Then get some food around the jar to attract its attention</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.342" end="00:37:12.651" style="s2"> Then put some more food in the jar</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.215" end="00:37:15.230" style="s2"> If you are lucky, the monkey will come</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.595" end="00:37:18.215" style="s2"> It will grab the food</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.488" end="00:37:21.346" style="s2"> Still want to eat what&#39;s in the jar</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.346" end="00:37:24.447" style="s2"> I will stick my paw in to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.718" end="00:37:27.098" style="s2"> If you trap well done</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.098" end="00:37:28.528" style="s2"> It just can&#39;t pull it out</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.728" end="00:37:31.712" style="s2"> Because it got food</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.914" end="00:37:35.428" style="s2"> Now if the monkey doesn’t let go</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:38.215" style="s2"> Don&#39;t give up</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.987" end="00:37:41.889" style="s2"> One just needs to walk over and catch the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.630" end="00:37:46.607" style="s2"> Monkeys don’t know how to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.098" end="00:37:48.090" style="s2"> It&#39;s just a monkey</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.144" end="00:37:50.470" style="s2"> Then you can catch it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.252" end="00:37:56.555" style="s2"> Because it can’t control hypothalamic desire</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.902" end="00:38:01.868" style="s2"> If you want to be kind to monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.161" end="00:38:03.935" style="s2"> Put sugar or something outside</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.935" end="00:38:05.543" style="s2"> Monkeys can only eat sugar a few times</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.731" end="00:38:08.653" style="s2"> Then it won&#39;t do everything like you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.966" end="00:38:10.261" style="s2"> But you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.232" end="00:38:14.154" style="s2"> &quot;People can go to the jar and catch the monkey.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.384" end="00:38:16.962" style="s2"> &quot;Animals will not give up parts for the whole&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.202" end="00:38:18.946" style="s2"> Is this a good conclusion?</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.363" end="00:38:22.401" style="s2"> Animals will not give up parts for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.593" end="00:38:26.294" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe this story is a bit false</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.691" end="00:38:29.572" style="s2"> &quot;But a paranoid psychology professor once told me</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.230" end="00:38:34.958" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Fictions are used to deceive people in as real a way as possible.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.294" end="00:38:39.541" style="s2"> &quot;If you give up valuable things, you can ensure future success.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.979" end="00:38:43.058" style="s2"> &quot;Things of value can please God after being sacrificed&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.601" end="00:38:45.000" style="s2"> Both have the same meaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.146" end="00:38:47.129" style="s2"> One of them is more clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.129" end="00:38:48.528" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.528" end="00:38:50.073" style="s2"> The second one is more dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.073" end="00:38:52.902" style="s2"> You might think the latter is more like</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.902" end="00:38:53.622" style="s2"> Embedded in the dream of collective religion</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.760" end="00:38:57.046" style="s2"> &quot;What is the most valuable and worthy of sacrifice&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.046" end="00:38:59.374" style="s2"> Obviously it depends on culture and time</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.378" end="00:39:02.975" style="s2"> &quot;At least you can ask what is more iconic&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.975" end="00:39:04.123" style="s2"> Such as &quot;the method of meat division&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.394" end="00:39:06.127" style="s2"> For example, if you are a herder</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.127" end="00:39:07.255" style="s2"> Then this is the big event</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.975" end="00:39:09.843" style="s2"> Generally speaking, looking at human history</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.843" end="00:39:12.171" style="s2"> Meat is a valuable commodity</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.171" end="00:39:13.779" style="s2"> In chimpanzees too</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.779" end="00:39:16.733" style="s2"> Chimpanzees like to hunt colobus monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.390" end="00:39:20.637" style="s2"> And basically eat live</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.637" end="00:39:21.879" style="s2"> The colobus weighs about 18 kg</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.829" end="00:39:25.167" style="s2"> Will keep screaming when eaten</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.835" end="00:39:26.858" style="s2"> This is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.046" end="00:39:30.146" style="s2"> One thing can be seen in male chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.146" end="00:39:32.004" style="s2"> Refers to the male chimpanzees who go out hunting</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.620" end="00:39:37.067" style="s2"> Males are not very restrained when hunting</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:39.572" style="s2"> Or you can say that you are not very sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:43.779" style="s2"> Certain human behaviors are indeed reminiscent of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.779" end="00:39:48.173" style="s2"> This kind of thing can often be seen on the human battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.309" end="00:39:54.468" style="s2"> A group of people give up all internal regulations</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.478" end="00:39:56.190" style="s2"> To a certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.190" end="00:39:59.885" style="s2"> Make you wonder whether the internal regulations exist</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.092" end="00:40:05.772" style="s2"> Just to get meat because meat is precious</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.722" end="00:40:10.021" style="s2"> There is a good literature</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.616" end="00:40:11.399" style="s2"> Books published not long ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.837" end="00:40:13.372" style="s2"> It&#39;s about a book about humans inventing fire</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.716" end="00:40:14.937" style="s2"> I said a little about this before</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.219" end="00:40:18.184" style="s2"> Langham thinks we invented fire</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.288" end="00:40:20.616" style="s2"> Mastered how to use fire approximately 2 to 3 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.616" end="00:40:22.599" style="s2"> This is much earlier than people thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.902" end="00:40:25.438" style="s2"> This has truly transformed us physically</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.438" end="00:40:27.547" style="s2"> From ancestors similar to chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.547" end="00:40:29.802" style="s2"> Until now, this slender looks</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.323" end="00:40:32.035" style="s2"> Cooked meat is better digested</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.035" end="00:40:38.163" style="s2"> Meat is an important source of nutritional energy required by the human body</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.163" end="00:40:39.144" style="s2"> Especially cooked meat</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.655" end="00:40:40.626" style="s2"> So meat is important</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.169" end="00:40:42.328" style="s2"> Cooked meat is important</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.956" end="00:40:45.501" style="s2"> The same applies to the choice of meat</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.317" end="00:40:49.113" style="s2"> The meat you will choose when you greet guests if you are not one</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.718" end="00:40:50.668" style="s2"> I keep saying the word wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.148" end="00:40:53.267" style="s2"> Is it called vegan?</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.455" end="00:40:54.071" style="s2"> Still called Vega (Vega)</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.092" end="00:40:55.553" style="s2"> I always say Vega but I read it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.553" end="00:40:57.714" style="s2"> Vega (Vega) is a star, right?</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.714" end="00:40:59.081" style="s2"> Vegans are not star creatures</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.764" end="00:41:04.582" style="s2"> You have to eat meat for the guests anyway</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.582" end="00:41:08.810" style="s2"> Especially when guests come to visit your house</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.810" end="00:41:11.910" style="s2"> And you are a herder</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.910" end="00:41:14.436" style="s2"> Then you have to make some high-end meat</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.436" end="00:41:18.205" style="s2"> Use the best part of the meat to entertain guests</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.205" end="00:41:19.321" style="s2"> This is really important</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.321" end="00:41:23.225" style="s2"> This is very meaningful and good livestock</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.570" end="00:41:24.896" style="s2"> What&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.459" end="00:41:28.862" style="s2"> Speaking of things you can sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.635" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2"> It can be your best livestock</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:33.737" style="s2"> How about sacrificing yourself and your children</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.313" end="00:41:38.131" style="s2"> In terms of hierarchy, children should be ranked behind</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.131" end="00:41:39.937" style="s2"> This is a bit hard to accept right</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.937" end="00:41:41.670" style="s2"> It’s like throwing a coin, hard to choose</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.098" end="00:41:46.315" style="s2"> From the perspective of sacrifice, you are more precious</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.315" end="00:41:47.182" style="s2"> Or your child is more precious</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.641" end="00:41:48.998" style="s2"> I have to say as a parent</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.998" end="00:41:51.033" style="s2"> Children are more precious</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.670" end="00:41:55.250" style="s2"> Most people have established</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.422" end="00:42:00.063" style="s2"> It’s hard to say &quot;appropriate&quot;, but let’s just say so</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.063" end="00:42:01.795" style="s2"> Established a suitable relationship with the child</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.317" end="00:42:05.918" style="s2"> Parents will block bullets for their children in critical moments</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.388" end="00:42:08.653" style="s2"> Let the child survive</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.484" end="00:42:14.739" style="s2"> &quot;Mother&#39;s sacrifice was Michelangelo</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.739" end="00:42:17.015" style="s2"> &quot;Deeply displayed in the form of the great sculpture &quot;The Pieta&quot;&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.643" end="00:42:21.159" style="s2"> &quot;The Virgin Mary stares at the crucified son&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.159" end="00:42:23.017" style="s2"> Jesus&#39; body was nailed to the cross</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.580" end="00:42:24.301" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s her fault&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.363" end="00:42:26.691" style="s2"> &quot;Through her, Jesus participated in the drama of beings.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.983" end="00:42:28.497" style="s2"> So what is the meaning of this sculpture</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.497" end="00:42:29.447" style="s2"> This is a great work</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.468" end="00:42:32.223" style="s2"> Incredible work</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.839" end="00:42:35.480" style="s2"> You can&#39;t even believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.480" end="00:42:37.578" style="s2"> Someone can create such a work</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.578" end="00:42:39.822" style="s2"> This is not the only work by Michelangelo, right</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.822" end="00:42:41.388" style="s2"> It’s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.941" end="00:42:43.925" style="s2"> It seems that this is the period when he finished other incredible masterpieces</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.925" end="00:42:46.336" style="s2"> I took a few months to make it by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.050" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2"> This is a work about meditation</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:53.382" style="s2"> So it is placed in the great cathedral of the great city</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.382" end="00:42:54.822" style="s2"> This is a work about meditation</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.459" end="00:42:56.712" style="s2"> The theme of this work is like saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.434" end="00:43:02.161" style="s2"> What will she do if she wakes up as a mother</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.768" end="00:43:06.399" style="s2"> A customer came to see me some time ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.048" end="00:43:09.739" style="s2"> That&#39;s a lady about 30 years old</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.783" end="00:43:12.161" style="s2"> Make personal decisions</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.177" end="00:43:17.422" style="s2"> She is very professional, so I asked her</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.121" end="00:43:20.157" style="s2"> Of course, her career development is also a little problematic</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.211" end="00:43:22.380" style="s2"> I&#39;ve seen this kind of thing many, many times</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.829" end="00:43:25.772" style="s2"> This is a story and a hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.785" end="00:43:29.739" style="s2"> I talked to her about other elements in her life</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.309" end="00:43:34.687" style="s2"> There are only five things in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.687" end="00:43:36.169" style="s2"> Career is gone</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.555" end="00:43:39.603" style="s2"> What valuable things have you done outside of your career</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.459" end="00:43:41.994" style="s2"> How is your family</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.994" end="00:43:43.382" style="s2"> May be related to your native family</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.382" end="00:43:44.447" style="s2"> Related to your biological siblings and so on</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.697" end="00:43:46.023" style="s2"> Do you have a close relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.534" end="00:43:49.269" style="s2"> What are your plans for your family</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.031" end="00:43:51.607" style="s2"> In addition to these five things</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.607" end="00:43:54.478" style="s2"> There are other things like exercise from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.478" end="00:44:00.324" style="s2"> Don’t eat too bad and stay away from crimes like drug abuse</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.532" end="00:44:02.902" style="s2"> That kind of lazy life</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.831" end="00:44:05.689" style="s2"> If you are missing any of these five things</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.524" end="00:44:08.580" style="s2"> Maybe you did any of them wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.580" end="00:44:09.353" style="s2"> That&#39;s the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.353" end="00:44:11.232" style="s2"> You can escape some trouble</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.232" end="00:44:11.868" style="s2"> But can&#39;t hide everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.568" end="00:44:14.248" style="s2"> She said so</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.353" end="00:44:16.597" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I want to have a baby&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.161" end="00:44:18.570" style="s2"> I think &quot;Gosh&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.570" end="00:44:20.104" style="s2"> &quot;Can you use your brain?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.219" end="00:44:22.390" style="s2"> I told her &quot;you are too old-fashioned&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.505" end="00:44:25.188" style="s2"> I said, &quot;You should think about this when you are 16&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.261" end="00:44:28.225" style="s2"> I was thinking &quot;Really, can you only do this?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.225" end="00:44:29.875" style="s2"> This lady is very smart</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.875" end="00:44:31.921" style="s2"> So I was thinking, &quot;Really, can you only do this?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.194" end="00:44:37.589" style="s2"> Of course there are bitterness and pain behind this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.069" end="00:44:42.432" style="s2"> If you ask 30 people who are hesitant to have children</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.693" end="00:44:43.800" style="s2"> What are they hesitating</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.186" end="00:44:45.720" style="s2"> Twenty of them will say, &quot;If you say too much, it will be tears.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.336" end="00:44:48.100" style="s2"> You know how old this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.184" end="00:44:50.407" style="s2"> This is too old-fashioned so it doesn&#39;t constitute an idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.407" end="00:44:55.522" style="s2"> This is a cultural gene, it is rooted in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.522" end="00:44:56.712" style="s2"> This is not an idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.244" end="00:45:01.722" style="s2"> Of course you shouldn’t just look at the apparent value in this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.722" end="00:45:03.319" style="s2"> Say &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t want to start a family&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.831" end="00:45:07.223" style="s2"> If you still have a little review, you will also comment on the price</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.311" end="00:45:11.106" style="s2"> There is a very common idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.555" end="00:45:13.841" style="s2"> &quot;There are too many people on Earth.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.432" end="00:45:18.893" style="s2"> I really don&#39;t like this view</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.845" end="00:45:22.432" style="s2"> Who do you want to die</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.777" end="00:45:24.447" style="s2"> How to let them die</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.835" end="00:45:27.025" style="s2"> This is a serious question</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.401" end="00:45:28.967" style="s2"> Who is saying there are too many people</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.395" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2"> What is going on with these people</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.443" end="00:45:34.321" style="s2"> &quot;We are wandering around and ruining the earth&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.614" end="00:45:38.873" style="s2"> By the way, the Club of Rome had predicted</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.873" end="00:45:41.910" style="s2"> There will be more people on Earth by the year 2000</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.910" end="00:45:43.518" style="s2"> The point that led to a massive famine</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.800" end="00:45:46.294" style="s2"> These people are really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.764" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2"> I think it is the Club of Rome that sees us as</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.530" end="00:45:52.150" style="s2"> Virus or cancer on earth</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.766" end="00:45:54.958" style="s2"> Really? Is that how you treat humans?</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.042" end="00:45:56.221" style="s2"> How can you do this</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.670" end="00:46:00.344" style="s2"> Is it okay to treat humans as viruses and cancer?</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.689" end="00:46:02.338" style="s2"> What would you do to viruses and cancer</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.578" end="00:46:04.374" style="s2"> Invite them in and make them feel at home</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.530" end="00:46:06.597" style="s2"> Of course you will destroy them</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.973" end="00:46:09.238" style="s2"> You should examine your metaphor friends</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.614" end="00:46:11.315" style="s2"> Because it was you who came up with these metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.315" end="00:46:12.547" style="s2"> Or do they control your mind? It’s really not clear</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.100" end="00:46:14.196" style="s2"> So it is better to pay attention to them</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.309" end="00:46:18.904" style="s2"> Back to the topic</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.029" end="00:46:24.342" style="s2"> Mary is the Virgin and the role of &quot;mother&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.562" end="00:46:26.889" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t matter whether she really exists</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.994" end="00:46:29.770" style="s2"> At least it can be said that she exists in a surreal sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.781" end="00:46:30.981" style="s2"> She exists as a Virgin</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.399" end="00:46:33.351" style="s2"> What kind of sacrifice did the Virgin made?</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.726" end="00:46:34.447" style="s2"> It&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.468" end="00:46:37.651" style="s2"> If you are a qualified mother</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.225" end="00:46:41.378" style="s2"> You will let your son be destroyed by the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.764" end="00:46:42.745" style="s2"> This is what a mother should do</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.309" end="00:46:45.428" style="s2"> This is bound to happen right</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.449" end="00:46:48.403" style="s2"> He will be born and suffer</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.507" end="00:46:50.407" style="s2"> Life is full of difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.417" end="00:46:52.171" style="s2"> He will get sick</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.599" end="00:46:55.658" style="s2"> Will experience failure and extinction</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.138" end="00:46:57.422" style="s2"> Eventually die</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.818" end="00:46:59.248" style="s2"> This is bound to happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.321" end="00:47:00.689" style="s2"> If you are sober you realize this</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.012" end="00:47:02.129" style="s2"> Then you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.255" end="00:47:04.729" style="s2"> Maybe this is the way to survive</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.104" end="00:47:06.722" style="s2"> Then you try to achieve these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.589" end="00:47:10.125" style="s2"> That&#39;s why you are worthy of this statue</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.526" end="00:47:14.342" style="s2"> But this is still a sacrifice made by the mother</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.507" end="00:47:20.856" style="s2"> Is it right to bring children into this bad world</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.557" end="00:47:24.729" style="s2"> Every woman asks herself this question</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.729" end="00:47:25.470" style="s2"> Some women&#39;s answers are no</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.470" end="00:47:26.336" style="s2"> They have their own reasons</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.265" end="00:47:28.977" style="s2"> Mary feels right spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.186" end="00:47:35.825" style="s2"> Mary is the archetype of a woman willing to bring new life</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.012" end="00:47:37.589" style="s2"> This is the meaning of this picture</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.382" end="00:47:40.386" style="s2"> Not because she can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.795" end="00:47:43.006" style="s2"> She knows what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.186" end="00:47:47.777" style="s2"> Mary is the archetype of a woman willing to bring new life</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.777" end="00:47:50.042" style="s2"> She fully understands the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.052" end="00:47:50.825" style="s2"> She is not naive</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.825" end="00:47:55.000" style="s2"> She&#39;s not the kind to be stupid because of being drunk</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.992" end="00:47:58.967" style="s2"> Woman accidentally pregnant in the back seat of a Chevrolet in 1957</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.165" end="00:47:59.791" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.209" end="00:48:02.881" style="s2"> She consciously</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.079" end="00:48:04.259" style="s2"> Know clearly what will happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.885" end="00:48:06.106" style="s2"> And then allow these things to happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.388" end="00:48:09.802" style="s2"> This is another thing that can prove mother&#39;s courage</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.979" end="00:48:11.106" style="s2"> My mother is very good at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.148" end="00:48:12.745" style="s2"> She is very friendly</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.163" end="00:48:14.541" style="s2"> From the point of view of her personal interests, she is a bit too friendly</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.386" end="00:48:17.077" style="s2"> But the character with high affinity will be like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.077" end="00:48:18.967" style="s2"> Your affinity is so high that it hurts your own interests</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.019" end="00:48:20.585" style="s2"> This is the definition of affinity</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.420" end="00:48:22.651" style="s2"> She is a good person</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.818" end="00:48:24.008" style="s2"> Fortunately she is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.008" end="00:48:26.576" style="s2"> She is still alive and we are very close</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.213" end="00:48:31.733" style="s2"> It&#39;s a good thing that I can always make her laugh</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.777" end="00:48:35.094" style="s2"> But she is also an iron lady</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.445" end="00:48:39.791" style="s2"> I remember one time she happened to ran into</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.190" end="00:48:45.856" style="s2"> When I was young in the town where I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.733" end="00:48:49.008" style="s2"> Playing in an empty baseball field</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.063" end="00:48:50.971" style="s2"> I was about ten years old</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.795" end="00:48:52.620" style="s2"> She passed here</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.996" end="00:48:54.144" style="s2"> I am with a group of friends</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.885" end="00:48:58.257" style="s2"> I am going to fight with this bear kid who often plays with</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.614" end="00:49:01.169" style="s2"> Half of the team are girls</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:06.701" style="s2"> Fighting may have something to do with state and skill</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.942" end="00:49:08.027" style="s2"> Anyway, we are going to fight</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.382" end="00:49:09.426" style="s2"> My mother passed by here</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.687" end="00:49:10.449" style="s2"> She glanced here</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.804" end="00:49:13.998" style="s2"> I can tell from her behavior</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.175" end="00:49:16.180" style="s2"> She knows what is going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.774" end="00:49:20.188" style="s2"> She glanced at me and walked away</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.397" end="00:49:24.520" style="s2"> I thought to myself, &quot;Wow mom did a great job.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.572" end="00:49:28.987" style="s2"> I really don&#39;t want her to come over at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.019" end="00:49:31.848" style="s2"> Then said, &quot;You kids are going to fight, right?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.265" end="00:49:33.956" style="s2"> Isn&#39;t it obvious</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.029" end="00:49:35.574" style="s2"> We are really ready to fight</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.574" end="00:49:37.547" style="s2"> If you come to stop</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.787" end="00:49:40.772" style="s2"> I lost before I started playing</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.461" end="00:49:47.933" style="s2"> So I really have to give my mom a thumbs up</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.933" end="00:49:49.186" style="s2"> She also said something before</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.635" end="00:49:53.758" style="s2"> I had conflicts with my father when I was a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.363" end="00:49:56.086" style="s2"> He and I have some conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.213" end="00:49:58.539" style="s2"> We two are evenly matched</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.685" end="00:50:00.804" style="s2"> Actually it should be 7 to 3</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.825" end="00:50:03.152" style="s2"> I am the one with more problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.967" end="00:50:06.962" style="s2"> I left home when I was 17</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.144" end="00:50:11.284" style="s2"> She said something very interesting when I left home</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.482" end="00:50:14.238" style="s2"> She said, &quot;If you live well at home, you will never leave.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.104" end="00:50:16.618" style="s2"> I thought to myself, &quot;Mom said so well&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.463" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2"> &quot;For a person with high affinity</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.946" end="00:50:20.250" style="s2"> &quot;You really have a backbone.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.649" end="00:50:22.328" style="s2"> Really awesome</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.006" end="00:50:30.083" style="s2"> &quot;Mother&quot; will also say</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.148" end="00:50:33.100" style="s2"> &quot;Go out and get frustrated.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.549" end="00:50:36.305" style="s2"> &quot;Because you are strong enough to handle it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.171" end="00:50:42.056" style="s2"> She doesn’t say, &quot;You can just lie down in the bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.651" end="00:50:45.292" style="s2"> &quot;Because the world is unfair, it didn&#39;t treat you well&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.647" end="00:50:47.662" style="s2"> &quot;It made you suffer too much.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.662" end="00:50:50.292" style="s2"> Instead, she would say &quot;The outside world is indeed full of suffering&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.096" end="00:50:53.205" style="s2"> &quot;But you are stronger than you think.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:00.929" style="s2"> &quot;Mary’s son Christ dedicated himself completely to God</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.090" end="00:51:05.125" style="s2"> &quot;In order to give him faith and trust in this world</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.125" end="00:51:08.142" style="s2"> &quot;It will not be broken by betrayal torture and death.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.017" end="00:51:14.729" style="s2"> &quot;This is an example of a respectable person&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.503" end="00:51:18.090" style="s2"> This is an interesting behavior</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.090" end="00:51:21.326" style="s2"> This is a mother who is willing to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.954" end="00:51:24.760" style="s2"> Laid the foundation for her son</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.760" end="00:51:26.712" style="s2"> And this son is willing to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.651" end="00:51:28.987" style="s2"> This result is very good</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.530" end="00:51:30.762" style="s2"> It&#39;s important to know this</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.056" end="00:51:33.726" style="s2"> &quot;But for Christ</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.726" end="00:51:34.802" style="s2"> &quot;When he sacrificed himself</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.065" end="00:51:39.635" style="s2"> &quot;God his Heavenly Father also sacrificed his own son at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.854" end="00:51:42.077" style="s2"> This is the strange thing about the Trinity model</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.077" end="00:51:44.906" style="s2"> That God sacrificed himself to himself</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.167" end="00:51:47.276" style="s2"> The same thing happened in Norse mythology, right</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.770" end="00:51:51.253" style="s2"> Is it Norse mythology? It should be Zeus</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.712" end="00:51:52.787" style="s2"> Germanic myth</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.413" end="00:51:55.292" style="s2"> Zeus sacrificed himself to himself</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.292" end="00:51:56.628" style="s2"> He hangs himself on the tree</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.931" end="00:51:58.372" style="s2"> And really got hurt</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.768" end="00:52:00.042" style="s2"> This is an interesting analogy</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.075" end="00:52:02.359" style="s2"> But I think part of the meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.674" end="00:52:05.762" style="s2"> Humans are trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.762" end="00:52:07.808" style="s2"> What is the ultimate sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.225" end="00:52:10.804" style="s2"> Similar to the ultimate sacrifice of value</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.211" end="00:52:14.562" style="s2"> Passion</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.292" end="00:52:16.827" style="s2"> I said before that I was laying the groundwork</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.827" end="00:52:20.908" style="s2"> I want to mention things that will not be discussed in the near future</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:22.860" style="s2"> Maybe it won’t be mentioned in this series of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.006" end="00:52:24.342" style="s2"> Because i don&#39;t know where i can talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.916" end="00:52:27.453" style="s2"> The mother has a request for her to make the ultimate sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.735" end="00:52:30.470" style="s2"> There is also a demand for his son to make the final sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.470" end="00:52:32.912" style="s2"> There is also a request for his father to make the final sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.985" end="00:52:34.875" style="s2"> And at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.678" end="00:52:38.038" style="s2"> This makes the ultimate sacrifice possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.361" end="00:52:40.292" style="s2"> And suppose this sacrifice brings recovery</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.355" end="00:52:42.714" style="s2"> This sacrifice brings recovery and salvation</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.455" end="00:52:44.687" style="s2"> This is a thought-provoking idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.864" end="00:52:46.086" style="s2"> It’s important</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.871" end="00:52:49.321" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if it is correct</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.478" end="00:52:51.628" style="s2"> But I know its reverse is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.486" end="00:52:57.526" style="s2"> Generally speaking, the wrong thing is right</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.340" end="00:52:59.614" style="s2"> The opposite of this is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.614" end="00:53:01.597" style="s2"> Because if the Virgin does not make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.701" end="00:53:03.883" style="s2"> Your family will fall into a terrible Oedipus situation</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.883" end="00:53:05.240" style="s2"> Or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.240" end="00:53:08.382" style="s2"> This is very bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.685" end="00:53:10.355" style="s2"> If you want to explore this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.449" end="00:53:14.645" style="s2"> I suggest you watch a documentary called &quot;Kruper&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.324" end="00:53:18.194" style="s2"> It is called the best documentary ever by some critics</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.194" end="00:53:19.551" style="s2"> This is really a good movie</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.802" end="00:53:21.482" style="s2"> This is the only one I have seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.837" end="00:53:25.157" style="s2"> A work that fully displays the Oedipus disaster</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.347" end="00:53:28.184" style="s2"> You can have a look</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.175" end="00:53:32.129" style="s2"> It&#39;s useless if the mother doesn&#39;t make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.129" end="00:53:34.134" style="s2"> If the father doesn’t make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.530" end="00:53:38.382" style="s2"> If the father is not willing to let his son go out</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.392" end="00:53:40.084" style="s2"> Be betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.084" end="00:53:42.902" style="s2"> Then there is no way to start</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.902" end="00:53:44.280" style="s2"> Because the child won&#39;t grow up</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.301" end="00:53:46.180" style="s2"> If my son is not willing to go out</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.180" end="00:53:48.518" style="s2"> So who will bear the responsibility?</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.499" end="00:53:51.566" style="s2"> If the sacrifice of the three parties did not happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.858" end="00:53:55.136" style="s2"> Everything is chaotic, disorderly and hellish</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.117" end="00:53:56.962" style="s2"> If all the sacrifices happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.983" end="00:53:58.372" style="s2"> Is this the opposite of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.392" end="00:53:59.217" style="s2"> you can say</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.217" end="00:54:02.234" style="s2"> Depends on the degree of these sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.787" end="00:54:03.685" style="s2"> This is a continuous state</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.685" end="00:54:05.616" style="s2"> How thorough can they happen</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.971" end="00:54:06.889" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.944" end="00:54:08.601" style="s2"> You might say</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.044" end="00:54:12.516" style="s2"> In the matter of &quot;encourage your children to live in the truth&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.662" end="00:54:14.906" style="s2"> How well you can do</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.628" end="00:54:18.215" style="s2"> This is a partial answer to this question</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.758" end="00:54:24.207" style="s2"> The answer is probably that you can’t do your best to do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.990" end="00:54:26.190" style="s2"> The result of this incident may be good</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.200" end="00:54:27.589" style="s2"> But you won&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.589" end="00:54:32.035" style="s2"> If you do this thing extremely well</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.035" end="00:54:32.933" style="s2"> How good the result will be</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.965" end="00:54:33.706" style="s2"> You won&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.906" end="00:54:36.253" style="s2"> People have hidden it</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.004" end="00:54:39.843" style="s2"> The interesting thing after having a baby is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.077" end="00:54:43.142" style="s2"> There are two things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.741" end="00:54:46.681" style="s2"> Actually there are more than two</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.236" end="00:54:52.192" style="s2"> There are three things you will know after you have children</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.192" end="00:54:54.228" style="s2"> The first is that you haven&#39;t grown up before</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.167" end="00:54:57.923" style="s2"> You won’t grow up until you have someone more important than yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.205" end="00:54:58.674" style="s2"> You really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.196" end="00:55:01.962" style="s2"> People think they will grow up without children</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.171" end="00:55:03.006" style="s2"> It’s just that they think so</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.006" end="00:55:06.044" style="s2"> Some people make other sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.180" end="00:55:10.491" style="s2"> But in my opinion this is not the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.689" end="00:55:12.067" style="s2"> This is not an elegant metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.731" end="00:55:18.956" style="s2"> But you will find that not being the focus of other people’s attention is actually a relief</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.977" end="00:55:21.722" style="s2"> It&#39;s good because you can relax</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.171" end="00:55:26.242" style="s2"> Because of course your children are in the family and society</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.242" end="00:55:27.703" style="s2"> Will immediately become the focus of attention</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.800" end="00:55:30.146" style="s2"> You will let your child become the focus of attention</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.908" end="00:55:32.192" style="s2"> Unless you are a narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.476" end="00:55:35.710" style="s2"> Then you will find all kinds of shining points on others</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.180" end="00:55:37.683" style="s2"> Others also like babies</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.683" end="00:55:38.466" style="s2"> This is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.466" end="00:55:40.470" style="s2"> We lived in Montreal when we raised our first child</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.127" end="00:55:44.342" style="s2"> The neighborhood we live in is not good by Montreal standards</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.436" end="00:55:47.641" style="s2"> Montreal is as good as Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.954" end="00:55:49.248" style="s2"> Even if it’s a slightly inferior neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.489" end="00:55:54.739" style="s2"> It also brings a little dark side in the charming</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.136" end="00:55:57.432" style="s2"> There are also a few difficult people in the block</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.432" end="00:55:58.142" style="s2"> The whole neighborhood is not very rich</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.570" end="00:56:01.848" style="s2"> We will push her around</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.129" end="00:56:05.104" style="s2"> These gloomy and frustrated old people will come over</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.324" end="00:56:07.317" style="s2"> I became radiant when I saw her</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.557" end="00:56:09.791" style="s2"> They will come over and smile at her</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.854" end="00:56:14.937" style="s2"> You will see the positive elements of human nature emerge</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.240" end="00:56:17.829" style="s2"> If you don’t react like this to babies</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.829" end="00:56:19.499" style="s2"> Then you really have a serious problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.804" end="00:56:22.150" style="s2"> this is not good</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.257" end="00:56:24.572" style="s2"> But seeing these</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.572" end="00:56:28.403" style="s2"> These people wandering listlessly in the street</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.854" end="00:56:35.355" style="s2"> Suddenly their burdens and precautions were put down</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.503" end="00:56:39.259" style="s2"> Babies are a bit like public property, which is strange</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.645" end="00:56:40.825" style="s2"> Just like a pregnant woman</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.712" end="00:56:44.666" style="s2"> People usually treat pregnant women as public property</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.666" end="00:56:45.658" style="s2"> I mean positive</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.658" end="00:56:47.672" style="s2"> They will say &quot;You are going to have a baby&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.332" end="00:56:51.013" style="s2"> Then do some caring things for pregnant women</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.676" end="00:56:56.148" style="s2"> The reason I told you this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.148" end="00:57:00.021" style="s2"> People have a strong urge to understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.491" end="00:57:04.656" style="s2"> The birth of a new life is a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.656" end="00:57:08.383" style="s2"> The miracle is that this new life is full of potential</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.633" end="00:57:10.793" style="s2"> This is all the potential that new life represents</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.973" end="00:57:16.326" style="s2"> Every new life is born means</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.388" end="00:57:19.029" style="s2"> Possibility of the birth of great people</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.386" end="00:57:21.555" style="s2"> One thing I think about is</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.296" end="00:57:23.883" style="s2"> One thing you don’t know is</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.530" end="00:57:26.367" style="s2"> Before you have your own children</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.399" end="00:57:27.474" style="s2"> Children are nothing special to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.800" end="00:57:31.576" style="s2"> But your own child is special</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.580" end="00:57:34.603" style="s2"> At the moment of his birth, this child</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.614" end="00:57:36.660" style="s2"> Is someone who has a closer relationship with you</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.722" end="00:57:38.946" style="s2"> May be closer than your relationship with anyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.342" end="00:57:42.234" style="s2"> And you can keep this relationship perfect</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.286" end="00:57:43.956" style="s2"> Most of the relationships you have established</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.956" end="00:57:46.336" style="s2"> Are built with people who have problems in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.608" end="00:57:47.578" style="s2"> You are not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.839" end="00:57:49.363" style="s2"> But you now have this child</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.597" end="00:57:52.651" style="s2"> It hasn&#39;t been destroyed yet</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.426" end="00:57:59.593" style="s2"> You may maintain this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.603" end="00:58:00.929" style="s2"> This kid likes you very much</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.023" end="00:58:03.977" style="s2"> Generally it will last a long time</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.541" end="00:58:05.515" style="s2"> When they were two years old</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.515" end="00:58:06.743" style="s2"> They will be happy to see you when you go home</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.743" end="00:58:08.142" style="s2"> Like raising a puppy</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.142" end="00:58:10.125" style="s2"> The puppy is so happy when you go home</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.107" end="00:58:13.017" style="s2"> How many people will be happy when you go home</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.038" end="00:58:14.457" style="s2"> They might say &quot;Hey again you&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.551" end="00:58:15.752" style="s2"> But kids are not like this</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.752" end="00:58:17.328" style="s2"> The children are really happy when you go home</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.641" end="00:58:18.800" style="s2"> You can keep this happy</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.344" end="00:58:24.415" style="s2"> This is something that our society does not value</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.415" end="00:58:28.351" style="s2"> The rustic elements of the relationship between children and parents</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.543" end="00:58:32.714" style="s2"> As if we were covering our eyes voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.714" end="00:58:34.697" style="s2"> This is really a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.697" end="00:58:40.209" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s really rare in life</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.209" end="00:58:43.246" style="s2"> There are things that compare with children to build healthy relationships</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.750" end="00:58:45.908" style="s2"> If you can maintain a good relationship with your children</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.908" end="00:58:49.906" style="s2"> They will be good company</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.328" end="00:58:53.027" style="s2"> It&#39;s worth the effort</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.883" end="00:58:55.407" style="s2"> The reason I tell you this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.407" end="00:58:56.816" style="s2"> People see baby</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.829" end="00:59:00.553" style="s2"> They will think this may be a potential savior of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.284" end="00:59:01.879" style="s2"> This is what they would think</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.693" end="00:59:06.441" style="s2"> They act like this, they think like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.370" end="00:59:09.050" style="s2"> Actually this is also true</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.992" end="00:59:12.850" style="s2"> I don’t know how real it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.553" end="00:59:20.574" style="s2"> But I think it might be because people are afraid to find the reason</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.338" end="00:59:23.372" style="s2"> At least in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.589" end="00:59:28.977" style="s2"> &quot;But for Christ</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.998" end="00:59:30.115" style="s2"> &quot;When he sacrificed himself</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.177" end="00:59:33.006" style="s2"> &quot;God his Heavenly Father also sacrificed his own son at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.215" end="00:59:34.457" style="s2"> &quot;This is in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.457" end="00:59:38.351" style="s2"> &quot;Sacrifice of son and self is the cause of archetype&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.633" end="00:59:40.010" style="s2"> &quot;There is nothing greater than this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.679" end="00:59:41.691" style="s2"> This is why it is a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.983" end="00:59:44.415" style="s2"> You can&#39;t go beyond it</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.520" end="00:59:51.305" style="s2"> &quot;This is the definition of archetype&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.347" end="00:59:53.090" style="s2"> &quot;This is the core of the religion.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.384" end="00:59:56.159" style="s2"> &quot;In all possible sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.159" end="00:59:57.589" style="s2"> &quot;The sacrifice of self and children is the greatest&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.975" end="00:59:59.259" style="s2"> &quot;This is beyond doubt.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.468" end="01:00:01.482" style="s2"> &quot;Pain and suffering define the world&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.869" end="01:00:03.831" style="s2"> &quot;The same is true.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.894" end="01:00:05.992" style="s2"> &quot;Those who want to resolve suffering</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.253" end="01:00:09.061" style="s2"> &quot;People who want the best possible future in architecture&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.436" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2"> &quot;Those who want to build heaven on earth</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.754" end="01:00:14.468" style="s2"> &quot;So I will dedicate everything I have to God</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.282" end="01:00:16.315" style="s2"> &quot;Dedicated to the life living in the truth&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.061" end="01:00:22.735" style="s2"> This is the book I will publish in January</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.808" end="01:00:24.342" style="s2"> Part of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.495" end="01:00:35.950" style="s2"> Speaking of &quot;Genesis&quot;, we have reached the fourth chapter</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.401" end="01:00:39.489" style="s2"> &quot;One day that man had a room with his wife Eve</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.054" end="01:00:44.969" style="s2"> &quot;Eve became pregnant and gave birth to Cain</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.052" end="01:00:45.679" style="s2"> &quot;Just say</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.441" end="01:00:48.152" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord gave me a man&quot; (Genesis 4:1)</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.332" end="01:00:52.401" style="s2"> This happened after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.173" end="01:00:54.489" style="s2"> what is interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.021" end="01:00:57.401" style="s2"> I really think the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.526" end="01:00:59.311" style="s2"> Is the deepest story I have ever read</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.937" end="01:01:03.622" style="s2"> Especially because you can tell this story in 15 seconds</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.831" end="01:01:07.046" style="s2"> I won’t tell a story in 15 seconds just because it’s hard for me</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.213" end="01:01:07.975" style="s2"> You may have noticed this too</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.257" end="01:01:11.263" style="s2"> But it’s so short you can read it right away</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.046" end="01:01:13.967" style="s2"> It is so concise and concise</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.395" end="01:01:15.543" style="s2"> I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.814" end="01:01:19.906" style="s2"> I can&#39;t believe it can be so concise and concise</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.906" end="01:01:21.754" style="s2"> First of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.735" end="01:01:24.813" style="s2"> Adam and Eve were not the first humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.658" end="01:01:27.610" style="s2"> Cain and Abel were the first humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.664" end="01:01:30.104" style="s2"> Adam and Eve were created by God</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.115" end="01:01:31.232" style="s2"> They were born in heaven</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.294" end="01:01:33.194" style="s2"> What kind of human is this</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.194" end="01:01:34.583" style="s2"> Humans are not like this</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.624" end="01:01:38.518" style="s2"> Human beings were not created by God and born in heaven</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.518" end="01:01:41.973" style="s2"> People are born of life</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.061" end="01:01:44.770" style="s2"> This is the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.791" end="01:01:46.159" style="s2"> This is after the &quot;fall&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.159" end="01:01:48.361" style="s2"> We are now in the long history</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.361" end="01:01:50.898" style="s2"> Not in the supernatural prototype</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.898" end="01:01:53.121" style="s2"> Although to some extent we are still in the supernatural prototype</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.340" end="01:01:56.628" style="s2"> But not to the degree of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.628" end="01:01:58.184" style="s2"> We have been expelled from the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.184" end="01:01:59.624" style="s2"> We already have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.927" end="01:02:00.908" style="s2"> We are already sober</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.326" end="01:02:04.395" style="s2"> We have learned to dress and work</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.000" end="01:02:06.910" style="s2"> We are sound humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:09.155" style="s2"> These are the first two humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.292" end="01:02:12.777" style="s2"> Cain and Abel are two human archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.424" end="01:02:16.921" style="s2"> It’s interesting that humans at the end of the Adam and Eve story</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.921" end="01:02:18.570" style="s2"> Into history</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.873" end="01:02:21.816" style="s2"> Then the prototype model of human behavior</p>

<p begin="01:02:26.336" end="01:02:28.089" style="s2"> It&#39;s very unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.476" end="01:02:31.086" style="s2"> This is not a very beautiful story</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.420" end="01:02:34.158" style="s2"> They are two rival brothers</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.158" end="01:02:38.624" style="s2"> It can be said that they are choking each other</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.685" end="01:02:41.013" style="s2"> Or at least one of them did</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.430" end="01:02:48.372" style="s2"> This is a story about the first two humans hurting each other</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.716" end="01:02:52.223" style="s2"> End with the death of the best one</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.873" end="01:02:56.555" style="s2"> This is the story of human beings who entered history</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.113" end="01:03:00.658" style="s2"> If this story can&#39;t make you have nightmares</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.940" end="01:03:02.985" style="s2"> Then you didn&#39;t understand it at all</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.086" end="01:03:10.261" style="s2"> In the stories of these hostile brothers</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.282" end="01:03:11.597" style="s2"> These stories are very common</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.620" end="01:03:14.572" style="s2"> Usually the brother is Cain</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.365" end="01:03:17.474" style="s2"> This is true in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.860" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2"> Is true in many kinds of folktales</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.545" end="01:03:22.693" style="s2"> In almost all stories</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.040" end="01:03:26.117" style="s2"> Brother has an advantage</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.127" end="01:03:26.869" style="s2"> He is brother</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.952" end="01:03:29.697" style="s2"> In farming society</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.697" end="01:03:33.288" style="s2"> Usually the older brother inherits the land</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.165" end="01:03:35.094" style="s2"> Not brother</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.094" end="01:03:36.347" style="s2"> The reason is</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.347" end="01:03:38.236" style="s2"> Suppose you have eight sons</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.236" end="01:03:40.605" style="s2"> You have enough land to feed your family</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.605" end="01:03:42.328" style="s2"> You divide the land among eight sons</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.631" end="01:03:43.643" style="s2"> They also have eight sons</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.643" end="01:03:45.188" style="s2"> They divided their land among eight sons</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.002" end="01:03:48.664" style="s2"> Soon the land will be divided into tiny shares</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.664" end="01:03:51.420" style="s2"> Everyone will starve to death</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.712" end="01:03:52.965" style="s2"> this will not work</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.006" end="01:03:57.881" style="s2"> You give the whole land to the eldest son</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.923" end="01:03:58.737" style="s2"> This is the right way</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.768" end="01:04:00.324" style="s2"> Unfortunate for others</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.324" end="01:04:03.466" style="s2"> But at least they will work hard by themselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.935" end="01:04:07.098" style="s2"> It&#39;s really unfair, but fairness is really unattainable</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:12.902" style="s2"> You can say that the eldest son is in the steady state of the existing hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.902" end="01:04:18.810" style="s2"> There are extra chips</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.821" end="01:04:20.856" style="s2"> He has more chips in the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.388" end="01:04:26.284" style="s2"> This makes him more like a symbol of the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.514" end="01:04:29.603" style="s2"> And it’s easier to get lost</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.603" end="01:04:30.699" style="s2"> It can be said like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.013" end="01:04:36.493" style="s2"> This theme often appears in the struggle between rival brothers</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.182" end="01:04:41.065" style="s2"> The story of Cain and Abel fits this pattern</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.065" end="01:04:44.092" style="s2"> Because Cain is the one who doesn&#39;t want to regress</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.426" end="01:04:45.031" style="s2"> He is stubborn</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.031" end="01:04:46.566" style="s2"> However, the second son Abel</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.921" end="01:04:48.518" style="s2"> He is usually</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.238" end="01:04:50.783" style="s2"> Can&#39;t be said to be revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.783" end="01:04:53.967" style="s2"> May be more like a balance between revolution and tradition</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.449" end="01:05:00.971" style="s2"> The eldest son is more like a traditional authoritarian</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.023" end="01:05:03.810" style="s2"> At least in these metaphorical representations</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.875" end="01:05:06.378" style="s2"> &quot;One day that man had a room with his wife Eve</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.524" end="01:05:07.641" style="s2"> &quot;Eve became pregnant and gave birth to Cain</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.641" end="01:05:09.718" style="s2"> &quot;They said that the Lord made me a man&quot; (Genesis 4:1)</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.441" end="01:05:12.965" style="s2"> This is the first human Cain</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.207" end="01:05:16.180" style="s2"> I have said before that Mesopotamians think</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.180" end="01:05:20.428" style="s2"> Humans are imaginable by the goddess of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.512" end="01:05:22.798" style="s2"> Made by the blood of the most evil demon</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.664" end="01:05:25.783" style="s2"> The first human being was a murderer</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.065" end="01:05:28.121" style="s2"> Not just a murderer, he is a brother killer</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.935" end="01:05:30.637" style="s2"> You know the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.919" end="01:05:32.171" style="s2"> This is a very strict book</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.725" end="01:05:35.814" style="s2"> You think this is a bit too much</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.002" end="01:05:40.209" style="s2"> But you will feel it is real</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.044" end="01:05:42.464" style="s2"> This is something worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.616" end="01:05:50.303" style="s2"> Humans are amazing creatures</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.679" end="01:05:53.027" style="s2"> If you think of human beings as the plague of the earth</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.622" end="01:05:56.628" style="s2"> The idea itself is a disaster</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.088" end="01:05:59.342" style="s2"> Is a vicious and indecent</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.662" end="01:06:04.812" style="s2"> Genocide metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.470" end="01:06:08.006" style="s2"> But this does not mean that we are flawless</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.299" end="01:06:12.192" style="s2"> This book is the cornerstone of our culture</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.134" end="01:06:18.184" style="s2"> Describe the first human being as a brother killer</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.184" end="01:06:20.940" style="s2"> Is really a blow to us</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.727" end="01:06:25.459" style="s2"> &quot;Cain&#39;s brother Abel was born again</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.480" end="01:06:28.570" style="s2"> &quot;Abel is the shepherd and Cain is the farmer&quot; (Genesis 4:2)</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.708" end="01:06:32.067" style="s2"> This is an old painting</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.547" end="01:06:34.416" style="s2"> Abel on the left</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.052" end="01:06:37.547" style="s2"> He put his sheep on the altar</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.933" end="01:06:39.791" style="s2"> Cain brought a handful of wheat ears</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.345" end="01:06:42.067" style="s2"> I am not very clear what this red line is</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.923" end="01:06:46.514" style="s2"> This is blood or rays</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.566" end="01:06:47.641" style="s2"> Almost like this</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.132" end="01:06:50.125" style="s2"> Generally speaking, something transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.606" end="01:06:54.729" style="s2"> Are communicating with this sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.292" end="01:06:57.954" style="s2"> You will think this is very primitive</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.403" end="01:07:01.910" style="s2"> How primitive these people are to sacrifice to God</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.188" end="01:07:06.514" style="s2"> These people are not stupid</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.265" end="01:07:08.528" style="s2"> This is not original</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.061" end="01:07:10.647" style="s2"> Not original anyway</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.647" end="01:07:12.119" style="s2"> Its complexity is far beyond your imagination</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.954" end="01:07:15.031" style="s2"> As I said, the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.031" end="01:07:16.942" style="s2"> You can sacrifice something valuable</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.942" end="01:07:18.977" style="s2"> This sacrifice will have a transcendent effect</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.395" end="01:07:21.952" style="s2"> This is by no means a simple idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.109" end="01:07:25.512" style="s2"> In fact, this may be the best idea that humans have come up with</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.455" end="01:07:29.802" style="s2"> This answers the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.812" end="01:07:33.163" style="s2"> Questions raised</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.163" end="01:07:34.677" style="s2"> We have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.750" end="01:07:36.232" style="s2"> We found the future</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.274" end="01:07:37.923" style="s2"> We know the inevitability of death</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.923" end="01:07:39.384" style="s2"> Understand our vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.384" end="01:07:40.365" style="s2"> We got shame</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.365" end="01:07:42.526" style="s2"> We have established the concept of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.526" end="01:07:44.760" style="s2"> We were cast out of heaven</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.760" end="01:07:46.221" style="s2"> This is a serious problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.743" end="01:07:50.282" style="s2"> What should you do? The answer is sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.574" end="01:07:51.743" style="s2"> This is a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.453" end="01:07:54.436" style="s2"> This is a very good assumption</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.541" end="01:07:55.741" style="s2"> This is exactly what we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.741" end="01:07:56.910" style="s2"> You make many sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.910" end="01:07:58.988" style="s2"> Even if you can sit in this theater</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.134" end="01:08:01.023" style="s2"> Many people have made great sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.587" end="01:08:03.466" style="s2"> To build such a theater</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.560" end="01:08:06.180" style="s2"> Many people made sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.180" end="01:08:09.917" style="s2"> So that we can be free in such a theater</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.136" end="01:08:11.159" style="s2"> Engage in such a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.307" end="01:08:14.457" style="s2"> Everything is built on the basis of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.635" end="01:08:16.326" style="s2"> Sacrifice works best</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.441" end="01:08:18.466" style="s2"> Because we can&#39;t think of a better idea</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.365" end="01:08:22.474" style="s2"> What is the opposite of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.933" end="01:08:24.447" style="s2"> Murder and theft</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.178" end="01:08:27.171" style="s2"> Then let&#39;s stick to sacrifice, okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.359" end="01:08:30.094" style="s2"> And we shouldn’t judge it as primitive</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.075" end="01:08:32.380" style="s2"> This is by no means original</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.184" end="01:08:35.104" style="s2"> &quot;Cain&#39;s brother Abel was born again</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.104" end="01:08:38.695" style="s2"> &quot;Abel is a shepherd and Cain is a farmer&quot; (Gen 4:2)</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.065" end="01:08:42.808" style="s2"> Some people interpret this as</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.436" end="01:08:48.205" style="s2"> The eternal struggle between the shepherd and the farmer</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.549" end="01:08:50.720" style="s2"> The war swept the western United States</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.347" end="01:08:55.000" style="s2"> The shepherd keeps his flock</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.303" end="01:08:57.265" style="s2"> Go where you want</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.631" end="01:09:00.345" style="s2"> Farmers and farmers built fences to block them</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.691" end="01:09:05.031" style="s2"> In the end, the farmer won</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.754" end="01:09:09.363" style="s2"> Back to the topic Abel is a shepherd</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.363" end="01:09:11.816" style="s2"> It&#39;s funny he became a shepherd</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.520" end="01:09:16.263" style="s2"> I think this is part of the critical issue</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.263" end="01:09:19.718" style="s2"> Because the shepherd we discussed earlier</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.470" end="01:09:23.059" style="s2"> If you observe Michelangelo’s &quot;Statue of David&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.059" end="01:09:26.566" style="s2"> &quot;The Statue of David&quot; is a shocking masterpiece</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.150" end="01:09:31.441" style="s2"> This David is not a small person</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.290" end="01:09:36.691" style="s2"> Obviously David was the one who killed Goliath</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.691" end="01:09:41.096" style="s2"> Goliath symbolizes the giant of the enemy of patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.096" end="01:09:41.931" style="s2"> Almost like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.528" end="01:09:47.109" style="s2"> Shepherds in the Middle East take care of their sheep</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.109" end="01:09:47.839" style="s2"> Sheep is edible</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.351" end="01:09:50.616" style="s2"> Lamb is very fragile</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.835" end="01:09:52.526" style="s2"> There are many wild predators outside</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.526" end="01:09:55.741" style="s2"> Not the same as England in the 16th century</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.378" end="01:09:57.234" style="s2"> There were lions in the wild at that time</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.403" end="01:10:00.835" style="s2"> You are holding a slingshot or stick or what kind of weapon</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.835" end="01:10:03.748" style="s2"> Your job is to look after the sheep alone</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.936" end="01:10:06.378" style="s2"> Let them at least not be eaten by lions</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.288" end="01:10:11.305" style="s2"> You must be strong and independent</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.305" end="01:10:12.119" style="s2"> You have to have these qualities</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.380" end="01:10:13.988" style="s2"> You have to be strong and independent</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.280" end="01:10:16.806" style="s2"> You have to protect a lot of fragile things</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.151" end="01:10:18.508" style="s2"> You have to be able to do it independently</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.029" end="01:10:22.391" style="s2"> This is established in the shepherd metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.447" end="01:10:26.065" style="s2"> This is not a good metaphor for modern people</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.065" end="01:10:27.756" style="s2"> Because we would think</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.756" end="01:10:30.251" style="s2"> Shepherd is like &quot;Little Boy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.672" end="01:10:38.299" style="s2"> Not to be a muscle monster that can kill lions</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.393" end="01:10:40.846" style="s2"> Shepherds are not like this. We think shepherds are easy</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.368" end="01:10:43.476" style="s2"> And the metaphor here is not like this</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.837" end="01:10:49.729" style="s2"> &quot;Abel is the shepherd and Cain is the farmer&quot; (Genesis 4:2)</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.720" end="01:10:52.662" style="s2"> &quot;One day</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.881" end="01:10:55.178" style="s2"> &quot;Cain took the produce from the field as an offering</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.178" end="01:10:56.545" style="s2"> &quot;To the Lord&quot; (Genesis 4:3)</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.474" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2"> So he participated in the sacrificial activities</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.167" end="01:11:04.677" style="s2"> &quot;Abel also offered the firstborn of his flock and the fat of the sheep</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.199" end="01:11:08.059" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord saw Abel and his offerings&quot; (Genesis 4:4)</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.637" end="01:11:12.088" style="s2"> You don&#39;t understand why</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.359" end="01:11:14.551" style="s2"> I think there is some inherent ambiguity here</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.775" end="01:11:19.123" style="s2"> I’m not sure but I think it’s the context</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.034" end="01:11:23.153" style="s2"> &quot;Abel also took the firstborn of his flock</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.153" end="01:11:24.249" style="s2"> &quot;To offer the fat of sheep&quot; (Genesis 4:4)</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.249" end="01:11:25.846" style="s2"> What does this mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.046" end="01:11:29.791" style="s2"> He brought high-quality sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.136" end="01:11:33.027" style="s2"> You can&#39;t say that what Cain brought is bad</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.873" end="01:11:35.272" style="s2"> Because it is not said in the original text</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.272" end="01:11:38.706" style="s2"> Did not say that Cain brought some rotten vegetables and burned it</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.706" end="01:11:39.645" style="s2"> Didn&#39;t say so</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.188" end="01:11:42.380" style="s2"> But there is no word</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.380" end="01:11:47.725" style="s2"> Describe how high-quality Abel’s sacrifices are</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:50.032" style="s2"> but no matter</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.042" end="01:11:52.495" style="s2"> Jehovah has eyes on Abel and his offerings</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.445" end="01:11:57.735" style="s2"> So there is a hint that Abel prepared sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.735" end="01:12:00.303" style="s2"> More attentive than Cain</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.804" end="01:12:02.579" style="s2"> But there are such hints</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.579" end="01:12:05.856" style="s2"> God likes you better than him</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.190" end="01:12:09.249" style="s2"> This is a meaningful point of view from a literary point of view</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:11.587" style="s2"> Because life is random</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.067" end="01:12:16.128" style="s2"> Like one of my children</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.750" end="01:12:21.159" style="s2"> He is always favored</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.245" end="01:12:25.679" style="s2"> He is lucky, whatever you want to describe</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.888" end="01:12:27.286" style="s2"> He seems to be this kind of person</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.620" end="01:12:28.539" style="s2"> And my other child</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.549" end="01:12:34.551" style="s2"> Just like Job, the unexplainable disaster followed one after another</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.480" end="01:12:37.338" style="s2"> This is a very strange phenomenon because</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.505" end="01:12:38.915" style="s2"> as far as I know</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.948" end="01:12:41.900" style="s2"> Differences in personality</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.537" end="01:12:46.513" style="s2"> Can&#39;t affect fate</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.944" end="01:12:49.959" style="s2"> This suffering child</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.599" end="01:12:54.885" style="s2"> She is really a great kid</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.286" end="01:13:06.514" style="s2"> She is happy, sunny, approachable and humorous</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.462" end="01:13:12.829" style="s2"> But she suffered too much</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.029" end="01:13:16.910" style="s2"> Who knows what god is going to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.249" end="01:13:22.245" style="s2"> Distributing fate fairly is certainly not one of his tasks</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.157" end="01:13:27.286" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord saw Abel and his offerings&quot; (Genesis 4:4)</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.286" end="01:13:31.796" style="s2"> &quot;Just look down on Cain and his offerings</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.873" end="01:13:35.115" style="s2"> &quot;Cain was very angry&quot; (Genesis 4:5)</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.313" end="01:13:38.174" style="s2"> Angry is a serious word</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.685" end="01:13:40.543" style="s2"> These articles have been translated many times</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.585" end="01:13:42.725" style="s2"> It is difficult to grasp the full meaning of the word itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.798" end="01:13:45.595" style="s2"> &quot;His face changed from anger&quot; (Genesis 4:4)</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.856" end="01:13:47.234" style="s2"> So angry</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.265" end="01:13:48.111" style="s2"> This is to raise the complexion</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.789" end="01:13:51.576" style="s2"> Hanging face means heavy heart</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.942" end="01:13:53.967" style="s2"> He is depressed, that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.259" end="01:13:56.284" style="s2"> He was furious, that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.493" end="01:13:58.800" style="s2"> It&#39;s not impossible for him to hold resentment</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.165" end="01:14:00.439" style="s2"> &quot;Get angry&quot; is anger</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.940" end="01:14:03.716" style="s2"> So Cain is not happy</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.812" end="01:14:07.171" style="s2"> Because of his hard work was rejected by God</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.558" end="01:14:09.551" style="s2"> This is worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.284" end="01:14:13.121" style="s2"> How much humanity there is in this story</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.050" end="01:14:16.660" style="s2"> You in life</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.858" end="01:14:20.919" style="s2"> You may be a useless character</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.138" end="01:14:23.591" style="s2"> You complain about how bad your life is</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.967" end="01:14:26.430" style="s2"> For you and everyone around you</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.430" end="01:14:27.735" style="s2"> Obviously everything is your fault</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.819" end="01:14:29.061" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t make an effort</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.332" end="01:14:30.647" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t get up early</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.981" end="01:14:32.245" style="s2"> You are not looking for a job</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.380" end="01:14:33.737" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t commit yourself fully</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.998" end="01:14:36.399" style="s2"> You are full of cynical complaints and anger</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.566" end="01:14:38.925" style="s2"> You are not eager to help people around you</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.925" end="01:14:41.472" style="s2"> Don&#39;t try to save your life</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.503" end="01:14:43.226" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.875" end="01:14:45.961" style="s2"> Then things became a mess</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.961" end="01:14:49.217" style="s2"> Otherwise what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.562" end="01:14:53.925" style="s2"> But that doesn’t mean that people in this situation will say</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.925" end="01:14:56.441" style="s2"> &quot;Okay, I deserve it&quot; and settle down</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.514" end="01:14:57.046" style="s2"> They won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.057" end="01:14:59.259" style="s2"> They will always complain and be angry</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.531" end="01:15:01.942" style="s2"> Let&#39;s not discuss this situation</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.130" end="01:15:06.013" style="s2"> Some people are working hard to face the suffering every day</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.650" end="01:15:09.938" style="s2"> But suffering still followed</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.547" end="01:15:15.418" style="s2"> There is no easy answer in this story</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.898" end="01:15:20.814" style="s2"> You can because your offering is inferior</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.253" end="01:15:24.155" style="s2"> And offend God</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.572" end="01:15:27.693" style="s2"> Or somehow you angered God</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.777" end="01:15:29.687" style="s2"> Then you are really unlucky</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.948" end="01:15:31.295" style="s2"> Then what will happen</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.295" end="01:15:34.384" style="s2"> In either case, almost inevitable is the following result</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.107" end="01:15:38.320" style="s2"> &quot;Cain became very angry and his face changed&quot; (Gen 4:4)</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.063" end="01:15:41.837" style="s2"> People like this always write to me</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.869" end="01:15:43.654" style="s2"> Many of my patients have this situation</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.593" end="01:15:48.612" style="s2"> Few people in their 20s are more in their 30s</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.695" end="01:15:49.405" style="s2"> Some in their 40s</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.405" end="01:15:50.794" style="s2"> Their life is not going well</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.180" end="01:15:54.405" style="s2"> Fell into despair</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.771" end="01:15:56.618" style="s2"> Not only in despair</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.639" end="01:15:58.268" style="s2"> They are still full of anger</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.268" end="01:16:00.752" style="s2"> God knows if you give them a chance to vent</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.762" end="01:16:03.842" style="s2"> What will they do with this anger</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.981" end="01:16:09.969" style="s2"> One thing I always think about Hitler is</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.608" end="01:16:14.103" style="s2"> Actually you have to convince Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.739" end="01:16:16.848" style="s2"> He is an organizational genius</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.612" end="01:16:21.305" style="s2"> Man will become Hitler&#39;s reason</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.205" end="01:16:30.470" style="s2"> People did not have the ambition to become Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.096" end="01:16:33.695" style="s2"> Not because they don’t have the motivation to destroy the race</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.541" end="01:16:36.242" style="s2"> They don&#39;t imitate Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.305" end="01:16:39.197" style="s2"> Because they don’t have this kind of organizational talent</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.708" end="01:16:41.775" style="s2"> They have this kind of motivation</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.986" end="01:16:45.115" style="s2"> If you randomly select 100 people</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.480" end="01:16:48.111" style="s2"> You communicate with them in depth</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.382" end="01:16:51.242" style="s2"> You will find 5% of people</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.639" end="01:16:55.366" style="s2"> If you give them a chance</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.585" end="01:16:57.349" style="s2"> They are willing to put their revenge plan into practice</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.359" end="01:16:58.403" style="s2"> In fact they do it</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.403" end="01:17:00.773" style="s2"> They make their lives miserable</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.773" end="01:17:01.942" style="s2"> Usually drag their family into the water</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.130" end="01:17:04.186" style="s2"> Sometimes they make everyone around them miserable</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.499" end="01:17:07.328" style="s2"> And the other 20% of them</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.537" end="01:17:11.462" style="s2"> It is normal for them to have such thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.332" end="01:17:16.044" style="s2"> You should be sympathetic to Cain</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.044" end="01:17:18.205" style="s2"> If you have no sympathy for Cain then you</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.282" end="01:17:24.426" style="s2"> Cain and Abel do not merely represent the archetypes of the two modes of being</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.900" end="01:17:29.645" style="s2"> It&#39;s not that you are Cain and you are Abel</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.645" end="01:17:32.777" style="s2"> But you are a combination of the two</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.777" end="01:17:33.570" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.570" end="01:17:36.535" style="s2"> These are two potential modes of fate</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.848" end="01:17:40.042" style="s2"> You won’t fully show one kind of another</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.084" end="01:17:44.625" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the dividing line between good and evil in human hearts</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.625" end="01:17:46.159" style="s2"> This is exactly the same concept</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.389" end="01:17:47.944" style="s2"> Maybe you are more like Cain</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.944" end="01:17:49.374" style="s2"> Maybe you are more like Abel</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.374" end="01:17:51.159" style="s2"> But no matter how much you resemble Abel</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.159" end="01:17:52.652" style="s2"> You still have a little Cain in your heart</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.153" end="01:17:57.088" style="s2"> Maybe you’re just a little bit like Cain, maybe more than a little</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.318" end="01:17:58.967" style="s2"> If you observe your fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.562" end="01:18:01.274" style="s2"> I strongly recommend you to observe</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.660" end="01:18:06.055" style="s2"> You will find that if you allow yourself to be conscious of what you think</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.764" end="01:18:12.067" style="s2"> You will be surprised at the dark side of these fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.499" end="01:18:17.485" style="s2"> When you are arguing with someone</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.238" end="01:18:20.616" style="s2"> At this time you should observe carefully</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.668" end="01:18:22.412" style="s2"> A picture flashing from the depths of your mind</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.412" end="01:18:24.969" style="s2"> This is in part with Carl Jung’s</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.969" end="01:18:27.046" style="s2"> &quot;Shadows&quot; are connected</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.453" end="01:18:29.781" style="s2"> &quot;Shadow&quot; is Cain&#39;s manifestation</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.126" end="01:18:31.869" style="s2"> It&#39;s very reasonable to think like this</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.203" end="01:18:34.395" style="s2"> One of Jung&#39;s descriptions of &quot;shadows&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.645" end="01:18:37.078" style="s2"> Jung’s view is not a joke</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.495" end="01:18:40.595" style="s2"> He said that the roots of the &quot;shadows&quot; of mankind go straight to hell</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.159" end="01:18:42.370" style="s2"> Jung is serious</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.474" end="01:18:43.988" style="s2"> It&#39;s not a metaphor for him</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.197" end="01:18:46.065" style="s2"> The meaning of his sentence may be the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.660" end="01:18:51.305" style="s2"> Fundamentalist Christians in the Southern United States have a different understanding</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.775" end="01:18:54.948" style="s2"> But I think Jung’s meaning is more scary</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.376" end="01:18:56.806" style="s2"> And more real</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.969" end="01:19:02.871" style="s2"> &quot;Cain became very angry and his face changed&quot; (Gen 4:4)</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.474" end="01:19:11.535" style="s2"> In the middle of the picture is Abel burning his offering</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.121" end="01:19:16.180" style="s2"> He and this we temporarily call</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.837" end="01:19:23.831" style="s2"> &quot;The original image of culture&quot; establishes a certain relationship</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.353" end="01:19:25.574" style="s2"> Archetype of the Father</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.286" end="01:19:28.382" style="s2"> This is someone he respects</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.518" end="01:19:32.485" style="s2"> This posture implies respect</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.771" end="01:19:36.409" style="s2"> And Cain is here in the background</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.409" end="01:19:38.153" style="s2"> His face is shrouded in shadows</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.180" end="01:19:43.654" style="s2"> He is jealous of the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.998" end="01:19:45.752" style="s2"> He&#39;s just doing things</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.201" end="01:19:47.683" style="s2"> Maybe God really doesn&#39;t like him</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.693" end="01:19:48.236" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.372" end="01:19:49.906" style="s2"> But he is really doing things perfunctory</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.324" end="01:19:51.817" style="s2"> He feels very upset</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.643" end="01:19:55.658" style="s2"> You can engrave this sentence on</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.159" end="01:20:00.387" style="s2"> Many people’s epitaphs on their tombstones</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.034" end="01:20:04.426" style="s2"> That is, &quot;doing nothing but end in depression&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.378" end="01:20:13.549" style="s2"> I think this picture is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.428" end="01:20:17.412" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what God is doing</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.103" end="01:20:21.681" style="s2"> He is helping to light the sacrificial flame</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.704" end="01:20:25.543" style="s2"> I think this is really interesting because</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.307" end="01:20:29.656" style="s2"> We assume you have the urge to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.771" end="01:20:33.153" style="s2"> You think I have to change my life</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.153" end="01:20:35.324" style="s2"> So where does this impulse come from</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.700" end="01:20:38.622" style="s2"> It is out of nothing</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.155" end="01:20:40.825" style="s2"> Or you figured it out</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.846" end="01:20:45.094" style="s2"> You better not be so sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.105" end="01:20:46.806" style="s2"> Your ideas are all your own</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.869" end="01:20:49.384" style="s2"> Didn&#39;t you come up with your dream?</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.011" end="01:20:50.992" style="s2"> They just happened</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.900" end="01:20:53.351" style="s2"> God knows where they came from</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.351" end="01:20:54.520" style="s2"> &quot;They come from the brain.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.520" end="01:20:56.806" style="s2"> This answer is really brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.869" end="01:20:58.351" style="s2"> &quot;They come from your unconscious&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.696" end="01:20:59.698" style="s2"> This answer is not much better</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.698" end="01:21:01.201" style="s2"> But at least a little better</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.451" end="01:21:04.750" style="s2"> These amazing episodes at night</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.750" end="01:21:06.618" style="s2"> Happen in your hall of imagination</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.775" end="01:21:08.414" style="s2"> You don&#39;t even understand what they are</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.414" end="01:21:10.585" style="s2"> But they will appear every night</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.783" end="01:21:13.361" style="s2"> Dreams can also contain wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.990" end="01:21:17.787" style="s2"> If people can understand the main points of dreams and remember them</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.787" end="01:21:20.188" style="s2"> They will be very shocked</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.313" end="01:21:22.004" style="s2"> It&#39;s like watching</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.025" end="01:21:24.228" style="s2"> You reveal to yourself wisdom that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.531" end="01:21:25.731" style="s2"> Where did this come from</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.754" end="01:21:27.526" style="s2"> You do not know</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.620" end="01:21:30.178" style="s2"> Why on earth can you dream of things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.295" end="01:21:32.130" style="s2"> This is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.641" end="01:21:33.570" style="s2"> Maybe in a certain lecture</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.591" end="01:21:35.334" style="s2"> We will discuss this issue</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.449" end="01:21:38.027" style="s2"> Because about this question</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.027" end="01:21:39.238" style="s2"> There are still a few reasonable answers</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.792" end="01:21:44.030" style="s2"> There is such a theory that it is not yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.030" end="01:21:46.462" style="s2"> Jung called it &quot;self&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.535" end="01:21:50.366" style="s2"> He thinks this is the sum of your existence across time and space</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.491" end="01:21:51.796" style="s2"> Almost like this</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.182" end="01:21:54.155" style="s2"> Every moment you exist</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.155" end="01:21:58.382" style="s2"> It’s the side of your &quot;self&quot; that crosses time and space.</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.403" end="01:22:02.203" style="s2"> He believes that &quot;self&quot; is part of the expression of conscience</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.432" end="01:22:05.261" style="s2"> No matter what &quot;conscience&quot; refers to this will be</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.491" end="01:22:07.245" style="s2"> Help you when you make difficult choices</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.255" end="01:22:10.721" style="s2"> The difficult choice may be what I need to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.284" end="01:22:12.923" style="s2"> How do I achieve self-discipline</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.602" end="01:22:15.157" style="s2"> What do i need to give up</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.700" end="01:22:17.860" style="s2"> How do you figure out these things</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.445" end="01:22:21.326" style="s2"> This painting is to express such an idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.566" end="01:22:25.146" style="s2"> If you have a good relationship with the Father</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.146" end="01:22:27.004" style="s2"> We discussed what it means</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.224" end="01:22:32.057" style="s2"> He will help you figure out how to light a sacrificial fire</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.307" end="01:22:36.858" style="s2"> So that you can maintain a good relationship with the Father for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.140" end="01:22:39.155" style="s2"> Is this an unreasonable proposal</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.729" end="01:22:41.410" style="s2"> What&#39;s the other proposal</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.735" end="01:22:45.386" style="s2"> What is certain is that Cain’s situation in the picture is not a good result</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.316" end="01:22:49.134" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what Cain is doing</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.134" end="01:22:52.109" style="s2"> Maybe he thinks only he can do it</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.109" end="01:22:55.073" style="s2"> Or he just wants to take credit or something</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.282" end="01:23:02.339" style="s2"> He has neither gratitude nor humility</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.339" end="01:23:05.334" style="s2"> There is no gratitude or humility in his posture</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.086" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2"> The pious posture should be like Abel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.840" end="01:23:09.238" style="s2"> Should be grateful and humble</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.238" end="01:23:09.886" style="s2"> Gratitude should be</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.240" end="01:23:13.508" style="s2"> &quot;Thank God for not making my life worse than the status quo&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.915" end="01:23:15.616" style="s2"> You should be grateful</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.616" end="01:23:17.631" style="s2"> Because your life may be worse than the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.309" end="01:23:19.405" style="s2"> Your life can be very bad</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.105" end="01:23:21.410" style="s2"> Humility should be</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.587" end="01:23:24.531" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t know how I can do better</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.656" end="01:23:26.347" style="s2"> &quot;But I am willing to listen to your suggestions.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.921" end="01:23:28.852" style="s2"> &quot;If I can figure out what to do, I will try hard.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.082" end="01:23:34.416" style="s2"> This is humility and humility</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.718" end="01:23:36.430" style="s2"> How can i do better</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.472" end="01:23:37.526" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.777" end="01:23:40.710" style="s2"> What kind of sacrifice do I need to make to make everything better</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.253" end="01:23:43.121" style="s2"> You should ask yourself this question</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.727" end="01:23:45.313" style="s2"> You can ask yourself every morning</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.702" end="01:23:49.478" style="s2"> What kind of sacrifice do I need to make to make everything better</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.541" end="01:23:53.309" style="s2"> You can decide what is the definition of &quot;better&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.602" end="01:23:55.721" style="s2"> Then this is not imposed on you</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.731" end="01:23:58.268" style="s2"> It’s you who figured out what constitutes &quot;better&quot; for you</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.487" end="01:24:00.063" style="s2"> Try to perfect this concept</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.063" end="01:24:01.817" style="s2"> You shouldn&#39;t just be better for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.067" end="01:24:03.873" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t work is it</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.291" end="01:24:06.952" style="s2"> If you are only for yourself, you will only go downhill</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.952" end="01:24:08.821" style="s2"> Because you live with others</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.821" end="01:24:10.053" style="s2"> And this idea is stupid no matter what</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.053" end="01:24:10.846" style="s2"> What are you going to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.581" end="01:24:15.950" style="s2"> Really have nothing to say</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.503" end="01:24:21.639" style="s2"> This is the attitude of two-year-olds who behave misbehaving and sexually violent.</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.380" end="01:24:23.737" style="s2"> I&#39;m not kidding</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.781" end="01:24:27.829" style="s2"> You can ask yourself</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.894" end="01:24:31.608" style="s2"> I have this whole day to plan</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.140" end="01:24:35.825" style="s2"> I need to give up something that hinders my progress</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.545" end="01:24:39.324" style="s2"> If I give up these things my life will be better</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.324" end="01:24:40.606" style="s2"> My family&#39;s life will be better</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.606" end="01:24:42.568" style="s2"> The cultural ecology behind me will get better</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.568" end="01:24:44.186" style="s2"> My being will become better</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.927" end="01:24:47.547" style="s2"> This will give you a plan for your day, right</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.965" end="01:24:50.230" style="s2"> This will prove the meaning of your miserable life</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.524" end="01:24:52.297" style="s2"> You need to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.297" end="01:24:55.522" style="s2"> This is the gist of the first story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.940" end="01:24:58.017" style="s2"> What a miserable life do you have</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.664" end="01:25:02.203" style="s2"> What do you need to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.662" end="01:25:04.677" style="s2"> If your life is miserable</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.687" end="01:25:07.495" style="s2"> If you just endure the pain stupidly and complain</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.495" end="01:25:08.894" style="s2"> This is what Cain did</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.894" end="01:25:10.282" style="s2"> What if you choose not to</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.324" end="01:25:13.643" style="s2"> Making bad choices things can get worse</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.019" end="01:25:16.817" style="s2"> Then if you make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.817" end="01:25:20.804" style="s2"> See if you can please God to get the being back on track</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.524" end="01:25:23.132" style="s2"> This is what to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.685" end="01:25:25.334" style="s2"> Is there a better choice than this</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.648" end="01:25:27.767" style="s2"> Could there be a better option</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.998" end="01:25:30.522" style="s2"> This is why it is a prototype</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.522" end="01:25:34.030" style="s2"> Because there is nothing better than it, it is optimal</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.345" end="01:25:37.798" style="s2"> You can do it every day</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.840" end="01:25:39.082" style="s2"> You have to do it bit by bit</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.082" end="01:25:41.149" style="s2"> What are you</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.483" end="01:25:44.259" style="s2"> You can&#39;t send a cannon for humans</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.259" end="01:25:47.412" style="s2"> A socialist utopia</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.821" end="01:26:02.140" style="s2"> You can think of it this way. Cain might figure this out.</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.453" end="01:26:04.698" style="s2"> There are several things that are not good for him</p>

<p begin="01:26:14.886" end="01:26:16.107" style="s2"> And inhaling the haze</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.107" end="01:26:17.286" style="s2"> The fire didn&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.683" end="01:26:21.149" style="s2"> May indicate that he did something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.545" end="01:26:23.706" style="s2"> Or he said while wiping tears</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.863" end="01:26:27.787" style="s2"> &quot;My God, what stupid world can give birth to such a haze&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.372" end="01:26:30.762" style="s2"> This is the more likely result</p>

<p begin="01:26:44.844" end="01:26:47.359" style="s2"> This sentence is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.716" end="01:26:53.539" style="s2"> I have seen many versions of translations in this seventh section</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.721" end="01:26:59.927" style="s2"> This is a very important sentence and its translation is really important</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.355" end="01:27:02.255" style="s2"> Let me tell you what I think the story is like</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.286" end="01:27:03.591" style="s2"> And what i figured out</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.677" end="01:27:06.723" style="s2"> I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.908" end="01:27:13.852" style="s2"> God says &quot;If you do well, won&#39;t you be acceptable?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.364" end="01:27:15.668" style="s2"> This is a hint right</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.055" end="01:27:18.539" style="s2"> It&#39;s like when you get frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.437" end="01:27:23.769" style="s2"> The first thing you will think is that you failed to do well</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.144" end="01:27:25.815" style="s2"> Does this mean what you are doing is not good</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.815" end="01:27:28.080" style="s2"> Does this mean your behavior is inappropriate</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.487" end="01:27:32.130" style="s2"> This is a reminder that God is suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.391" end="01:27:36.916" style="s2"> You will succeed if you behave properly</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.372" end="01:27:39.677" style="s2"> I once had a friend who said in a way</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.698" end="01:27:41.368" style="s2"> A person full of resentment</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.255" end="01:27:43.716" style="s2"> He used to have problems</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.865" end="01:27:46.232" style="s2"> Part of the problem is to blame</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.232" end="01:27:48.330" style="s2"> Part of the problem is destined. I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.217" end="01:27:52.046" style="s2"> He has become very destructive</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.046" end="01:27:55.387" style="s2"> I think it’s the kind of destructive life</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.387" end="01:27:56.775" style="s2"> Can be seen in his dreams</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.881" end="01:27:59.082" style="s2"> He lived with me for a while</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.245" end="01:28:03.215" style="s2"> I know him well</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.215" end="01:28:05.042" style="s2"> He has been my friend since I was 12</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.042" end="01:28:07.683" style="s2"> Until he committed suicide around 40</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.522" end="01:28:11.577" style="s2"> When he lived with me</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.577" end="01:28:13.069" style="s2"> I tried to cheer him up</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.069" end="01:28:14.698" style="s2"> This is why he came to live with me</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.261" end="01:28:17.683" style="s2"> Because he thinks maybe I can help him cheer up</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.476" end="01:28:21.671" style="s2"> He can only do some low-end jobs</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.746" end="01:28:23.936" style="s2"> He has some mechanical skills</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.936" end="01:28:25.021" style="s2"> Although he is not well educated</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.021" end="01:28:26.587" style="s2"> But very very smart</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.597" end="01:28:29.416" style="s2"> His IQ may be around 135</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.416" end="01:28:31.274" style="s2"> He is smart but unwilling</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.274" end="01:28:33.518" style="s2"> Because he didn&#39;t let himself be educated</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.529" end="01:28:35.627" style="s2"> Matches his intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.013" end="01:28:38.351" style="s2"> He can only do some work under his intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.706" end="01:28:41.368" style="s2"> He really has that intellectual arrogance and</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.796" end="01:28:47.892" style="s2"> Really smart people often believe that only smartness is the most important thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.341" end="01:28:49.301" style="s2"> If they are smart</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.301" end="01:28:51.879" style="s2"> And only being smart is the most important</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.879" end="01:28:55.042" style="s2"> Then the world will surrender to their feet</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.063" end="01:28:56.597" style="s2"> Then they will be betrayed brutally</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.203" end="01:29:00.032" style="s2"> Then they focus on their intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.032" end="01:29:01.921" style="s2"> At this time intelligence is more like a gift or genius</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.921" end="01:29:05.032" style="s2"> It&#39;s like an idol, a false idol</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.053" end="01:29:07.266" style="s2"> Is such a very dangerous idol</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.257" end="01:29:11.128" style="s2"> Because of the stupidity of the world</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.128" end="01:29:13.998" style="s2"> And they become cynical</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.364" end="01:29:15.533" style="s2"> But this is not helpful</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.326" end="01:29:18.059" style="s2"> Smart is a good thing but I want to tell you</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.069" end="01:29:20.126" style="s2"> If you don’t make good use of it, it will eat you back</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.126" end="01:29:22.923" style="s2"> Like all the talents given at will</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.842" end="01:29:25.021" style="s2"> You may have talent</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.439" end="01:29:27.902" style="s2"> But only by making good use of it will it become your friend</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.902" end="01:29:30.501" style="s2"> If you use it wrongly, it will become your enemy</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.773" end="01:29:33.675" style="s2"> Maybe God adjusts the scale of the universe in this way</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.426" end="01:29:36.556" style="s2"> In short, my friend is a very smart person</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.556" end="01:29:39.499" style="s2"> Although unfortunately not as smart as he imagined</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.000" end="01:29:43.883" style="s2"> He didn&#39;t make good use of his intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.343" end="01:29:46.691" style="s2"> Failed to show it to the world well</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.691" end="01:29:48.132" style="s2"> It also made him angry</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.132" end="01:29:50.094" style="s2"> Because he also knows</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.804" end="01:29:52.088" style="s2"> If he makes good use of his intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.088" end="01:29:53.195" style="s2"> His achievements will go beyond this</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.518" end="01:29:55.157" style="s2"> Maybe now he can achieve higher achievements</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.397" end="01:29:58.769" style="s2"> I suggest him when he is living with us</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.769" end="01:30:03.403" style="s2"> Because at that time he almost became a tramp</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.040" end="01:30:06.410" style="s2"> I suggest that he should find a job within his capacity</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.671" end="01:30:09.938" style="s2"> Jobs like working in garbage stations and shops</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.990" end="01:30:11.389" style="s2"> Because he is better at mechanical principles</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.015" end="01:30:17.819" style="s2"> I also suggest that he should give up that arrogance</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.850" end="01:30:21.378" style="s2"> I think this kind of job is not worthy of him</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.861" end="01:30:24.875" style="s2"> No job was not worthy of him in that situation</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.875" end="01:30:26.253" style="s2"> But more importantly</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.493" end="01:30:29.154" style="s2"> &quot;Work is not worthy of people&quot; actually doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.314" end="01:30:31.013" style="s2"> You know because</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.247" end="01:30:39.489" style="s2"> Imagine you have a job at a grocery store</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.489" end="01:30:41.117" style="s2"> This is a fairly unskilled job</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.399" end="01:30:43.696" style="s2"> You can be a hapless grumbling while doing this job</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.779" end="01:30:45.992" style="s2"> It can also be an annoying person</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.295" end="01:30:47.213" style="s2"> You can go to work</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.224" end="01:30:51.044" style="s2"> Just lose your temper and complain and make mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.316" end="01:30:53.612" style="s2"> Guarantee any customer</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.612" end="01:30:57.203" style="s2"> When I pass by you, I have to stop for a day</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.403" end="01:31:01.462" style="s2"> You can steal from the busy or even guard yourself</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.462" end="01:31:06.107" style="s2"> Dissatisfied with the employer</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.117" end="01:31:08.184" style="s2"> Because they are higher than you in this dominance level</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.184" end="01:31:13.101" style="s2"> You can also talk bad and gossip behind your colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.790" end="01:31:17.861" style="s2"> You can accept this humble job that you think</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.247" end="01:31:20.794" style="s2"> Then transform it into a little hell</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.086" end="01:31:21.911" style="s2"> You can do it</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.172" end="01:31:23.769" style="s2"> You go to a place like this</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.769" end="01:31:26.190" style="s2"> I always think of such a prototype of a roadside snack bar</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.441" end="01:31:27.787" style="s2"> You have all been to this kind of shop</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.215" end="01:31:30.199" style="s2"> Of course there are also good restaurants</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.428" end="01:31:33.716" style="s2"> There is a very good video on YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.134" end="01:31:36.243" style="s2"> Tom Weitz read a poem in it</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.243" end="01:31:37.631" style="s2"> Written by Bukowski</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.215" end="01:31:39.614" style="s2"> I remember this poem is called &quot;Nirvana&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.240" end="01:31:41.712" style="s2"> This is a poem about a good store</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.036" end="01:31:45.512" style="s2"> Bukowski took the bus as a child</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.512" end="01:31:47.151" style="s2"> A small restaurant I visited by accident</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.537" end="01:31:49.385" style="s2"> It&#39;s a nice restaurant everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.719" end="01:31:51.754" style="s2"> You can listen to it is great</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.224" end="01:31:54.103" style="s2"> But this one I think of is completely different</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.113" end="01:31:55.314" style="s2"> You walk into the small restaurant</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.232" end="01:31:57.339" style="s2"> It&#39;s seven o&#39;clock in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.694" end="01:32:00.355" style="s2"> You ordered bacon, eggs and some toast</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.702" end="01:32:03.403" style="s2"> You look around you think</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.447" end="01:32:07.913" style="s2"> The windows seem to have not been wiped since 1975</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.975" end="01:32:13.028" style="s2"> There is a thick layer of old oil stains on the surrounding walls</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.800" end="01:32:16.138" style="s2"> The floor is also slimy</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.138" end="01:32:19.019" style="s2"> It really takes years to do it</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.447" end="01:32:22.328" style="s2"> The waitress was glum there</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.568" end="01:32:24.092" style="s2"> The guy behind the counter also pulled his face</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.092" end="01:32:26.712" style="s2"> Because it happened to be on duty with the waitress</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.245" end="01:32:30.762" style="s2"> Then you go downstairs to the bathroom</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.992" end="01:32:32.213" style="s2"> And it took quite a while</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.863" end="01:32:36.211" style="s2"> You came back and ordered an egg</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.222" end="01:32:39.061" style="s2"> Ordered a toast and ordered a bacon</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.750" end="01:32:44.364" style="s2"> The rice came up, but the egg was fried</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.364" end="01:32:47.328" style="s2"> So it becomes brownish black but it&#39;s a bit raw on it</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.309" end="01:32:49.249" style="s2"> Still cold in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.063" end="01:32:52.255" style="s2"> You really need to spend some time to make this kind of egg</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.255" end="01:32:55.940" style="s2"> But ten years of resentment can let you easily control this technology</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.170" end="01:32:57.819" style="s2"> It will tell you how to make such an egg</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.226" end="01:33:00.115" style="s2"> Then it’s toast, here’s toast</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.804" end="01:33:03.873" style="s2"> You take white bread first</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.873" end="01:33:06.357" style="s2"> The kind of bread that no one wants to eat</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.796" end="01:33:08.675" style="s2"> And put it in the bread machine</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.810" end="01:33:09.854" style="s2"> Burn it</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.522" end="01:33:13.299" style="s2"> Wait a minute and let the toast pop out of the bread machine</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.560" end="01:33:15.616" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s burnt, we need to scrape off the black ash</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.785" end="01:33:19.071" style="s2"> You flick some crumbs to make them look less burnt</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.071" end="01:33:23.393" style="s2"> Then you wait for it to get cold and apply cold margarine</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.792" end="01:33:25.888" style="s2"> First of all it is not butter</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.149" end="01:33:27.485" style="s2"> But if you put on cold margarine</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.485" end="01:33:29.165" style="s2"> The cream will be spread like a honeycomb</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.531" end="01:33:33.957" style="s2"> Secondly, the margarine will condense into pieces and very dry</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.957" end="01:33:35.303" style="s2"> But very greasy</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.303" end="01:33:37.714" style="s2"> It&#39;s like a chic work of art</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.988" end="01:33:43.351" style="s2"> You put it next to the egg</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.351" end="01:33:44.645" style="s2"> Then bring potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.927" end="01:33:46.869" style="s2"> Here is how to make potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.094" end="01:33:51.441" style="s2"> First, we have to make leftover potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.984" end="01:33:54.677" style="s2"> And you have to keep putting new leftover potatoes for weeks</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.677" end="01:33:57.015" style="s2"> Mixed into old potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.015" end="01:33:59.854" style="s2"> Some potatoes can&#39;t be called potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.909" end="01:34:03.226" style="s2"> Some of them have already returned to the embrace of Mother Earth</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.211" end="01:34:08.059" style="s2"> You dump them on the grill</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.351" end="01:34:12.046" style="s2"> Then symbolically I don’t know what to say and burn it twice.</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.213" end="01:34:15.282" style="s2"> And throw it on the plate</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.387" end="01:34:18.894" style="s2"> You won&#39;t want to eat this stuff, no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.894" end="01:34:19.698" style="s2"> But this is the key</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.243" end="01:34:22.537" style="s2"> Then you have to take out the bacon</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.589" end="01:34:26.243" style="s2"> You have to make sure that you buy the worst bacon</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.243" end="01:34:28.633" style="s2"> So we can start</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.030" end="01:34:30.460" style="s2"> You throw them on the grill</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.835" end="01:34:34.165" style="s2"> For this, your grill must be overheated</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.207" end="01:34:35.752" style="s2"> So you fried bacon</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.752" end="01:34:38.863" style="s2"> There will be some place where there will be some place</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.155" end="01:34:41.973" style="s2"> It has a pleasant pig smell</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.973" end="01:34:45.627" style="s2"> Only the bacon that is very cheap and smashed will have</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.034" end="01:34:48.320" style="s2"> Or you can use that kind of breakfast sausage</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.581" end="01:34:50.303" style="s2"> If it wasn&#39;t for the brain water</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.303" end="01:34:52.902" style="s2"> No one would put this sausage within five meters of a person</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.124" end="01:34:55.376" style="s2"> Then you serve</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.627" end="01:34:58.174" style="s2"> The so-called orange juice was served together</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.257" end="01:35:00.303" style="s2"> The only thing that looks like an orange is the color</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.447" end="01:35:07.746" style="s2"> There is also coffee</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.435" end="01:35:11.201" style="s2"> How do you say this shop opened too early in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.597" end="01:35:12.526" style="s2"> This is the first condition</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.289" end="01:35:16.065" style="s2"> A cup of poor quality coffee started the day prematurely</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.234" end="01:35:20.136" style="s2"> It has been cold once or twice and reheated</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.449" end="01:35:24.061" style="s2"> Then you add whitening powder when you serve it</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.034" end="01:35:28.257" style="s2"> Now your breakfast is ready</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.257" end="01:35:29.802" style="s2"> Who likes to eat</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.959" end="01:35:32.359" style="s2"> This is breakfast, this is hell</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.679" end="01:35:42.641" style="s2"> And this is the hell you made by yourself</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.111" end="01:35:45.418" style="s2"> What would you do if you had such a restaurant</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.898" end="01:35:47.088" style="s2"> Because if you have such a restaurant</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.088" end="01:35:48.309" style="s2"> You will live a miserable life</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.330" end="01:35:49.614" style="s2"> You really worked hard on this matter</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.614" end="01:35:54.259" style="s2"> You go home and scold your wife and children</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.572" end="01:35:56.942" style="s2"> And yell at God</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.234" end="01:35:58.539" style="s2"> Because he actually created a world</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.664" end="01:36:01.284" style="s2"> Allow such a restaurant you run to exist</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.765" end="01:36:03.184" style="s2"> This is your bloody life</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.159" end="01:36:08.497" style="s2"> This is what God wants to warn of here</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.468" end="01:36:22.370" style="s2"> &quot;If you do well, won&#39;t you be accepted?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.416" end="01:36:27.714" style="s2"> &quot;If you don’t do well, sin at the door&quot; (Genesis 4:7)</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.257" end="01:36:31.942" style="s2"> I actually checked a lot of translations for this sentence</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.714" end="01:36:33.602" style="s2"> Its next sentence is</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.623" end="01:36:36.170" style="s2"> &quot;It will adore you but you will subdue it&quot; (Genesis 4:7)</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.967" end="01:36:41.368" style="s2"> God wants to say like this</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.954" end="01:36:44.520" style="s2"> Things are not going well for you</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.531" end="01:36:46.159" style="s2"> But things will get better if you behave decently</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.159" end="01:36:47.537" style="s2"> But you did the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.620" end="01:36:48.581" style="s2"> Sin comes to your door</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.831" end="01:36:51.827" style="s2"> &quot;Sin&quot; means miss the target</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.973" end="01:36:52.725" style="s2"> Sin comes to your door</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.122" end="01:36:54.218" style="s2"> But he used a metaphorical approach</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.249" end="01:36:55.261" style="s2"> This metaphor is like saying</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.992" end="01:37:01.347" style="s2"> Sin comes to your door like a cat in heat</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.942" end="01:37:05.533" style="s2"> You invited it in at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.222" end="01:37:08.122" style="s2"> Then you let it do whatever it wants</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.332" end="01:37:11.232" style="s2"> It’s like you have entered a creative</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.600" end="01:37:13.884" style="s2"> He uses a sexual metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.395" end="01:37:16.775" style="s2"> You enter a creative exchange with it</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.401" end="01:37:19.760" style="s2"> And produce a result</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.053" end="01:37:21.952" style="s2"> No matter what you give birth to, that is your life</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.218" end="01:37:25.303" style="s2"> You know it well</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.554" end="01:37:27.109" style="s2"> After all you have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.339" end="01:37:28.581" style="s2"> You know what you are doing</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.276" end="01:37:33.289" style="s2"> You conspired with it</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.635" end="01:37:37.986" style="s2"> Create a situation where you put yourself in it</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.643" end="01:37:40.199" style="s2"> Jung once described it</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.908" end="01:37:43.445" style="s2"> Similar to Oedipus complex</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.241" end="01:37:47.099" style="s2"> Of course his views are not politically correct</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.683" end="01:37:49.990" style="s2"> Of course everything he wrote is not politically correct</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.752" end="01:37:53.696" style="s2"> That&#39;s why it can be called a thinker</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.119" end="01:37:59.990" style="s2"> He said that an evil alliance exists in</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.000" end="01:38:02.213" style="s2"> Between children who are extremely dependent on others and their mothers</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.289" end="01:38:04.510" style="s2"> He said actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.656" end="01:38:07.297" style="s2"> Freud thought it was about motherhood</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.641" end="01:38:08.717" style="s2"> I&#39;m not belittling Freud</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.520" end="01:38:11.691" style="s2"> Freud geniusly sketched the Oedipus complex</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.433" end="01:38:13.487" style="s2"> I&#39;m not belittling Freud</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.696" end="01:38:17.506" style="s2"> But Jung accepted these ideas and extended them</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.445" end="01:38:21.410" style="s2"> He said that an evil alliance exists in</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.754" end="01:38:23.132" style="s2"> In a child who is extremely dependent on others</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.132" end="01:38:24.499" style="s2"> With an Oedipus complex</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.499" end="01:38:25.564" style="s2"> Between mothers who are too dependent on others</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.909" end="01:38:28.549" style="s2"> In this alliance, mothers always give</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.833" end="01:38:31.942" style="s2"> So for example, when a child wants to do something</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.942" end="01:38:33.529" style="s2"> When things require a little courage and hard work</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.017" end="01:38:43.226" style="s2"> And the mother would say &quot;Do you think you can do it?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.364" end="01:38:50.460" style="s2"> Then the child will say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.460" end="01:38:54.458" style="s2"> Then his mother will coax him to bed and take care of everything</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.948" end="01:38:58.142" style="s2"> But the fact is that the child also made a decision</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.727" end="01:39:00.418" style="s2"> You would think it&#39;s cruel to children</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.044" end="01:39:03.289" style="s2"> But don’t think children are stupid just because they are young</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.969" end="01:39:07.172" style="s2"> If you don’t know how children understand</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.172" end="01:39:08.904" style="s2"> You don’t know how to manipulate the child</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.562" end="01:39:11.566" style="s2"> They are unexpectedly good at this</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.025" end="01:39:14.270" style="s2"> He will keep studying you trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.510" end="01:39:16.316" style="s2"> What is your intention</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.608" end="01:39:19.896" style="s2"> 2. How can they achieve their goals as they wish</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.606" end="01:39:23.174" style="s2"> They can play manipulation games without a doubt</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.330" end="01:39:24.833" style="s2"> Especially when they practice hard</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.053" end="01:39:26.044" style="s2"> Kind of like this</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.462" end="01:39:30.522" style="s2"> Maybe the mother is a little timid and overprotective</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.522" end="01:39:33.153" style="s2"> And the child may manipulate a little</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.382" end="01:39:37.819" style="s2"> I&#39;m not willing to take a brave step to integrate into the world</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.819" end="01:39:40.867" style="s2"> On the contrary, they are willing to degenerate into a dependent state</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.587" end="01:39:45.449" style="s2"> Over time, a terrible dynamic will be established</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.856" end="01:39:46.984" style="s2"> Like a vicious circle</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.224" end="01:39:48.873" style="s2"> Or like a positive feedback loop</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.873" end="01:39:50.522" style="s2"> It keeps expanding and expanding</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.543" end="01:39:52.172" style="s2"> Sometimes in some families you can see</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.746" end="01:39:53.904" style="s2"> Have a very attached child</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.458" end="01:39:57.297" style="s2"> Share the same mother with a very independent child</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.376" end="01:40:01.723" style="s2"> Mother is very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.005" end="01:40:04.896" style="s2"> The mother is different for child A and child B</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.896" end="01:40:06.879" style="s2"> Even if they are the same person</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.879" end="01:40:08.487" style="s2"> Have a clear description of this literary work</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.685" end="01:40:09.510" style="s2"> You should know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.771" end="01:40:10.898" style="s2"> God&#39;s will is</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.487" end="01:40:15.669" style="s2"> Not only pay attention to whether you behave properly</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.669" end="01:40:18.372" style="s2"> Because you did misbehaving</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.372" end="01:40:19.270" style="s2"> It’s because of your misbehavior</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.280" end="01:40:23.476" style="s2"> You really spent time researching how to misbehave</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.623" end="01:40:26.274" style="s2"> This seems to be your creative endeavor</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.681" end="01:40:29.823" style="s2"> If you want to understand the real vicious person</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.854" end="01:40:31.879" style="s2"> You can start with the Columbine campus killer</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.026" end="01:40:34.447" style="s2"> They leave many interesting diaries</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.729" end="01:40:35.856" style="s2"> I recommend everyone to read</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.963" end="01:40:39.061" style="s2"> You can read more about serial killers</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.061" end="01:40:41.253" style="s2"> These people really went out and did some very dark things</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.253" end="01:40:44.092" style="s2"> I read a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.103" end="01:40:45.460" style="s2"> And know it very well</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.163" end="01:40:52.067" style="s2"> If you really want to make yourself hateful</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.975" end="01:40:56.796" style="s2"> Then think about your own disaster for ten years</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.453" end="01:41:03.946" style="s2"> Be alone and let your fantasy take shape to encourage them</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.938" end="01:41:08.863" style="s2"> Let them blossom and bear fruit, in other words let them control you</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.249" end="01:41:11.023" style="s2"> This is the correct idea to understand this diary</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.493" end="01:41:14.833" style="s2"> It will bring you to such a situation</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.700" end="01:41:18.393" style="s2"> There are more people like this than you think</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.946" end="01:41:20.877" style="s2"> And you are more like this kind of person than you think</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.564" end="01:41:29.364" style="s2"> So Cain is obviously very unhappy with the whole answer</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.554" end="01:41:31.754" style="s2"> If your people generate a disaster</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.806" end="01:41:34.124" style="s2"> This is the last thing you want to hear</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.124" end="01:41:37.036" style="s2"> And in your heart, God created the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.036" end="01:41:38.852" style="s2"> And this world allows this kind of thing to happen</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.134" end="01:41:41.222" style="s2"> In the end it said it was your own fault</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.337" end="01:41:43.977" style="s2"> And said you should cheer up</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.197" end="01:41:47.360" style="s2"> And you should not complain about the nature of being</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.957" end="01:41:50.543" style="s2"> This is the answer he got</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.731" end="01:41:51.618" style="s2"> What will happen next</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.589" end="01:41:54.124" style="s2"> We can almost conclude</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.124" end="01:41:56.044" style="s2"> If Cain was resentful before</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.462" end="01:41:58.758" style="s2"> Then he is even more angry now</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.145" end="01:42:03.790" style="s2"> Of course this is exactly what the story intends to reveal</p>

<p begin="01:42:21.639" end="01:42:23.236" style="s2"> Also this part comes from the same chapter of my book</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.124" end="01:42:25.731" style="s2"> The chapter is titled &quot;Do meaningful things, not expedients&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.096" end="01:42:27.537" style="s2"> &quot;According to the story</p>

<p begin="01:42:36.744" end="01:42:38.664" style="s2"> &quot;As we see Cain is very unhappy.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.218" end="01:42:41.044" style="s2"> &quot;He works hard or he thinks so</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.128" end="01:42:42.203" style="s2"> &quot;But God is not satisfied&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.631" end="01:42:45.345" style="s2"> &quot;At the same time Abel is dancing among the daisies&quot;</p>

<p begin="01:42:47.694" end="01:42:49.489" style="s2"> &quot;What&#39;s worse is that he is a very good person.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.230" end="01:42:51.013" style="s2"> &quot;Everyone understands this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.284" end="01:42:52.610" style="s2"> &quot;He deserves his luck.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.383" end="01:42:54.896" style="s2"> &quot;This adds another reason to hate him.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.773" end="01:42:58.142" style="s2"> I used to make jokes when I taught at Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.456" end="01:43:00.846" style="s2"> My wife will invite young graduate students to be guests at home from time to time</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.326" end="01:43:02.621" style="s2"> Afterwards we often make jokes</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.111" end="01:43:05.898" style="s2"> Because most of them are outstanding children</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.808" end="01:43:09.625" style="s2"> They are extremely smart or possess sports expertise</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.625" end="01:43:12.756" style="s2"> Or have theatrical or musical talent</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.756" end="01:43:15.282" style="s2"> Or have done a remarkable charity act</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.773" end="01:43:17.756" style="s2"> Because I basically have to be admitted to Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.756" end="01:43:19.823" style="s2"> You must be the top person in your school</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.303" end="01:43:21.347" style="s2"> Then you need to have at least</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.347" end="01:43:23.685" style="s2"> Two other outstanding advantages</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.301" end="01:43:26.441" style="s2"> The most annoying thing about most of these kids is</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.441" end="01:43:30.481" style="s2"> This is a joke, you really like and respect them</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.796" end="01:43:32.558" style="s2"> My joke is</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.558" end="01:43:34.197" style="s2"> You think they must have at least some desirable qualities</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.218" end="01:43:37.474" style="s2"> To be a nasty bastard</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.547" end="01:43:41.034" style="s2"> Except for all other advantages in them</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.034" end="01:43:44.823" style="s2"> They also need to behave nicely</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.823" end="01:43:46.086" style="s2"> So you think</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.086" end="01:43:47.944" style="s2"> &quot;Such good things should happen to them&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.996" end="01:43:49.176" style="s2"> Gosh</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.593" end="01:43:52.276" style="s2"> It&#39;s like Abel&#39;s situation</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.205" end="01:43:56.149" style="s2"> The funny thing is that this is an ideal</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.284" end="01:43:57.109" style="s2"> This is the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.485" end="01:43:59.113" style="s2"> It can be said that this is an ideal person</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.113" end="01:44:02.955" style="s2"> This is the person you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.965" end="01:44:05.888" style="s2"> What this person does in this world</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.888" end="01:44:07.840" style="s2"> Is what you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.059" end="01:44:10.355" style="s2"> This person is favored by fate</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.355" end="01:44:12.422" style="s2"> This person made the right sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.589" end="01:44:15.105" style="s2"> This is who you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.295" end="01:44:17.808" style="s2"> So Cain killed him</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.387" end="01:44:22.067" style="s2"> This is also a psychological story</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.276" end="01:44:25.126" style="s2"> When people express cynical views about successful people in the world</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.491" end="01:44:28.675" style="s2"> You can find this psychology</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.675" end="01:44:31.806" style="s2"> They are always speculating about the reasons for their success</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.806" end="01:44:32.641" style="s2"> &quot;They must do whatever it takes.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.652" end="01:44:34.844" style="s2"> &quot;They must be scheming.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.844" end="01:44:36.357" style="s2"> &quot;They must be arrogant and rude&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.357" end="01:44:37.673" style="s2"> &quot;They must be mentally perverted.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.289" end="01:44:40.261" style="s2"> Of course these all exist</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.428" end="01:44:44.280" style="s2"> But self-deception is a terrible trick</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.280" end="01:44:46.817" style="s2"> Think this person in the world</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.911" end="01:44:49.270" style="s2"> The person who represents your ideal</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.614" end="01:44:52.996" style="s2"> It&#39;s all created by despicable reasons</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.132" end="01:44:55.115" style="s2"> Because you will train yourself accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.220" end="01:44:57.829" style="s2"> If the ideal life you should pursue exists, it can only be</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.829" end="01:44:59.886" style="s2"> Motivated by despicable reasons</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.209" end="01:45:03.320" style="s2"> Then, not only Abel, your brother died</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.320" end="01:45:05.950" style="s2"> Just like your brother in reality in the field</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.243" end="01:45:08.936" style="s2"> At the same time you have destroyed your ideals</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.833" end="01:45:11.712" style="s2"> What are you going after?</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.712" end="01:45:13.257" style="s2"> How will you live</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.802" end="01:45:16.754" style="s2"> There is no doubt that it is full of misery and pain</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.026" end="01:45:19.312" style="s2"> Full of complaints and misery</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.656" end="01:45:20.930" style="s2"> You will live like this</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.952" end="01:45:25.418" style="s2"> I rarely see it especially in public</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.337" end="01:45:30.794" style="s2"> People honestly admit that except for sports stars</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.086" end="01:45:33.069" style="s2"> This place seems to happen</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.424" end="01:45:39.280" style="s2"> But people in any public communication</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.614" end="01:45:44.197" style="s2"> It is rare to express admiration and gratitude</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.322" end="01:45:48.466" style="s2"> Various newspapers and TV shows on YouTube and Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.936" end="01:45:53.978" style="s2"> Almost always slander and criticism</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.061" end="01:45:56.128" style="s2"> And often for those</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.282" end="01:46:01.702" style="s2"> Those single-minded</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.702" end="01:46:05.585" style="s2"> People who benefit others</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.984" end="01:46:09.698" style="s2"> This is one reason why this story has a profound meaning</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.495" end="01:46:14.030" style="s2"> &quot;He is a nice guy everyone knows&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.030" end="01:46:15.355" style="s2"> &quot;His luck deserves it&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.658" end="01:46:18.456" style="s2"> &quot;There is more reason to hate him.&quot; No doubt</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.831" end="01:46:20.522" style="s2"> &quot;Cain is anxious about his misfortune</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.721" end="01:46:22.276" style="s2"> &quot;Like a vulture hatching an egg&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.788" end="01:46:25.460" style="s2"> &quot;He entered the desert of his own mind.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.731" end="01:46:28.863" style="s2"> &quot;He was trapped by his own misfortune and betrayal.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.207" end="01:46:30.794" style="s2"> &quot;He nourishes his resentment&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.792" end="01:46:37.725" style="s2"> &quot;He is addicted to more and more detailed revenge fantasy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.445" end="01:46:40.982" style="s2"> &quot;His arrogance reached the level of Lucifer.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.378" end="01:46:44.103" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;I have been abused and oppressed,&#39; he thinks.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.583" end="01:46:48.028" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;This is a stupid damn earth&quot; should go to hell&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.165" end="01:46:51.692" style="s2"> &quot;In this case he met Satan in the wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.213" end="01:46:54.176" style="s2"> &quot;And captured by Satan&#39;s temptation&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.815" end="01:46:56.785" style="s2"> &quot;He did his best</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.785" end="01:46:58.957" style="s2"> &quot;To use the timeless words of John Milton</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.666" end="01:47:03.289" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Uproot humans</p>

<p begin="01:47:14.155" end="01:47:16.598" style="s2"> &quot;He became evil in order to obtain good forbidden him to get&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.869" end="01:47:20.888" style="s2"> &quot;When he did this, he was voluntarily sober and malicious.&quot;</p>

<p begin="01:48:16.284" end="01:48:20.919" style="s2"> You can read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.360" end="01:48:24.896" style="s2"> This is a great novel</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.896" end="01:48:26.692" style="s2"> I think it may be the greatest novel to date</p>

<p begin="01:48:30.157" end="01:48:33.330" style="s2"> This is the greatest novel worthy of its name</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.875" end="01:48:38.644" style="s2"> It tells the psychological changes when you commit a big crime</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.708" end="01:48:41.608" style="s2"> Amazing</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.888" end="01:48:48.007" style="s2"> Psychologists like Dostoyevsky are unparalleled in the world</p>

<p begin="01:49:04.249" end="01:49:06.827" style="s2"> I think the punishment God imposed on Cain</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.351" end="01:49:11.900" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the inevitable consequence of Cain&#39;s actions</p>

<p begin="01:49:58.988" end="01:50:03.852" style="s2"> It is true that after making this kind of mistake</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.092" end="01:50:05.366" style="s2"> You can&#39;t turn back the prodigal son and convert to God</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.502" end="01:50:10.021" style="s2"> Because you have tried your best</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.428" end="01:50:13.717" style="s2"> To offend God, if he exists</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.270" end="01:50:16.629" style="s2"> The possibility that you can repair this relationship</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.629" end="01:50:19.865" style="s2"> This relationship in a severed state</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.898" end="01:50:22.610" style="s2"> It was impossible to fix from the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.610" end="01:50:24.687" style="s2"> Because you did such a bad thing before</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.752" end="01:50:27.360" style="s2"> The possibility of this repair approaches zero</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.101" end="01:50:31.076" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Whoever meets me will kill me&quot; (Genesis 4:14)</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.305" end="01:50:32.840" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord said to him</p>

<p begin="01:50:38.811" end="01:50:40.481" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord gave Cain a mark</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.512" end="01:50:42.401" style="s2"> &quot;Lest people meet him and kill him&quot; (Genesis 4:15)</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.715" end="01:50:44.030" style="s2"> This is an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.353" end="01:50:45.721" style="s2"> I used to think for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.721" end="01:50:46.462" style="s2"> You might not figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.462" end="01:50:48.550" style="s2"> Why should God shelter Cain</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.550" end="01:50:50.335" style="s2"> And on the premise that he committed such atrocity</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.335" end="01:50:54.437" style="s2"> I think this is related to the emergence of an idea</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.437" end="01:50:58.727" style="s2"> That is to say, it is necessary to prevent &quot;retaliation&quot; style retaliatory killings</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.270" end="01:51:00.261" style="s2"> Roughly what it means</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.305" end="01:51:03.550" style="s2"> This is implied in later chapters</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.666" end="01:51:06.566" style="s2"> It&#39;s like okay i killed your brother</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.566" end="01:51:08.195" style="s2"> Then you killed my two brothers</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.195" end="01:51:10.512" style="s2"> Then I killed your family</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.512" end="01:51:11.973" style="s2"> Then you killed people in my entire town</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.973" end="01:51:13.591" style="s2"> Then I killed you all over the country</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.591" end="01:51:14.719" style="s2"> Then we destroyed the world together</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.376" end="01:51:20.564" style="s2"> This should not be a clever way to solve the original problem</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.846" end="01:51:22.099" style="s2"> Despite the initial problem</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.099" end="01:51:24.927" style="s2"> It may be about murder that is not easy to solve</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.345" end="01:51:26.754" style="s2"> But i think so</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.276" end="01:51:29.510" style="s2"> The last part of this story</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.804" end="01:51:31.796" style="s2"> This painting is the work of William Black</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.752" end="01:51:38.122" style="s2"> Adam and Eve found their dead son</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.211" end="01:51:44.771" style="s2"> I think Cain also started to realize</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.771" end="01:51:47.161" style="s2"> What he did and what he was</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.038" end="01:51:50.763" style="s2"> This is another way to self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.975" end="01:51:55.522" style="s2"> Adam and Eve are in the process of forming self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.522" end="01:51:56.692" style="s2"> Very painful</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.287" end="01:51:59.562" style="s2"> They begin to recognize their own fragile nudity</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.562" end="01:52:01.618" style="s2"> And maybe they have the ability to do evil</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.099" end="01:52:04.103" style="s2"> But Cain began to realize that he was</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.328" end="01:52:09.792" style="s2"> Willing to walk with evil</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.522" end="01:52:15.763" style="s2"> And think this is a vital ability for humans</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.297" end="01:52:18.602" style="s2"> We modern people</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.239" end="01:52:20.836" style="s2"> We don’t take this seriously</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.034" end="01:52:25.063" style="s2"> In academic circles and intellectual circles</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.063" end="01:52:27.193" style="s2"> The idea of ​​evil has been</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.777" end="01:52:29.155" style="s2"> Everyone will ask &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.032" end="01:52:31.399" style="s2"> &quot;When was the Middle Ages?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.953" end="01:52:34.677" style="s2"> If a topic as a starting point of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.708" end="01:52:39.165" style="s2"> This whole idea of ​​&quot;evil&quot; will die before you get away.</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.886" end="01:52:42.213" style="s2"> This is something I have never understood</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.213" end="01:52:47.067" style="s2"> I can&#39;t understand how you did it</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.067" end="01:52:50.429" style="s2"> There is only a superficial understanding of the history of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.900" end="01:52:54.959" style="s2"> No need to have a deep understanding of 20th century history</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.669" end="01:52:58.946" style="s2"> After that, but failed to draw the following conclusions</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.385" end="01:53:03.226" style="s2"> &quot;Good may not exist but evil&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.011" end="01:53:09.416" style="s2"> The existence of evil is ironclad</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.850" end="01:53:18.257" style="s2"> Denying its existence can only mean pretending to be invisible</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.673" end="01:53:25.115" style="s2"> This is a very useful discovery for me</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.825" end="01:53:32.568" style="s2"> I can also infer that if evil does exist</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.798" end="01:53:36.942" style="s2"> Then according to the inference, its opposite should also exist</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.216" end="01:53:39.510" style="s2"> The opposite of evil</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.667" end="01:53:41.493" style="s2"> Take the evil in the concentration camp as an example</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.786" end="01:53:43.518" style="s2"> Our understanding of the above will be more clear</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.436" end="01:53:46.493" style="s2"> This happened in Auschwitz</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.485" end="01:53:51.942" style="s2"> They drove people off the train at the station</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.088" end="01:53:53.080" style="s2"> Those who are still alive</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.330" end="01:54:00.397" style="s2"> Not the people crowded together outside the car</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.940" end="01:54:03.393" style="s2"> They have been frozen to death due to the cold</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.581" end="01:54:06.410" style="s2"> But those who are squeezed in the middle to be warmer</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.046" end="01:54:09.802" style="s2"> Maybe some old people will die from suffocation</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.802" end="01:54:13.268" style="s2"> But at least some people were still alive when they arrived in Auschwitz</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.278" end="01:54:14.656" style="s2"> They drove these poor people out</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.719" end="01:54:16.921" style="s2"> One of the tricks soldiers often play against them is</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.412" end="01:54:21.786" style="s2"> Let the new prisoners carry</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.307" end="01:54:24.865" style="s2"> Sacks containing approximately 45 kg of wet salt</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.865" end="01:54:27.005" style="s2"> Move from one end of the camp</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.955" end="01:54:29.155" style="s2"> These camps are huge</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.155" end="01:54:29.907" style="s2"> Like a city</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.938" end="01:54:32.401" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like a gym, it&#39;s like a city</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.401" end="01:54:34.040" style="s2"> Thousands of people are there</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.437" end="01:54:36.274" style="s2"> They let these people carry wet salt bags</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.274" end="01:54:39.990" style="s2"> From one end of the camp to the other and back</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.639" end="01:54:45.596" style="s2"> This is ironic of a concept</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.596" end="01:54:47.360" style="s2"> That is &quot;work gives you freedom&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.454" end="01:54:48.080" style="s2"> It’s like saying &quot;Think beautiful&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.289" end="01:54:50.909" style="s2"> &quot;You are exhausted and exhausted here.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.942" end="01:54:55.251" style="s2"> In a sense it wants to explain the opposite of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.898" end="01:54:57.955" style="s2"> We let you do your job</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.955" end="01:55:00.366" style="s2"> But it can only speed up your death</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.763" end="01:55:02.537" style="s2"> Maybe we can embellish it</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.537" end="01:55:04.437" style="s2"> Because it will not only speed up your death</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.437" end="01:55:06.055" style="s2"> It will also proceed in a painful way</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.420" end="01:55:09.051" style="s2"> It also raises a possibility</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.051" end="01:55:12.224" style="s2"> That is to say, other people are suffering from the same disease, it is better to die</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.756" end="01:55:14.520" style="s2"> There is no doubt that this is an art</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.036" end="01:55:19.019" style="s2"> If you understand this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.019" end="01:55:21.117" style="s2"> Don’t think this is evil yet</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.827" end="01:55:23.748" style="s2"> Then you will understand what this means to you</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.898" end="01:55:27.767" style="s2"> &quot;So Cain left the presence of the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.767" end="01:55:30.105" style="s2"> &quot;Go and live in the land of Nod, east of Eden&quot; (Genesis 4:16)</p>

<p begin="01:55:36.650" end="01:55:41.253" style="s2"> A common criticism of &quot;Bible&quot; stories</p>

<p begin="01:55:47.902" end="01:55:51.932" style="s2"> &quot;Does this story seem a bit brainless&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.391" end="01:55:54.520" style="s2"> No, this question will make the reader seem brainless</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.815" end="01:55:56.629" style="s2"> I mean are you serious</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.629" end="01:55:58.967" style="s2"> Is this the best criticism you can think of</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.763" end="01:56:02.986" style="s2"> You might say &quot;Oh, you didn&#39;t catch the point&quot;</p>

<p begin="01:57:41.326" end="01:57:43.800" style="s2"> This ability has also developed into murder intent</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.800" end="01:57:47.516" style="s2"> This goes beyond just killing brothers</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.581" end="01:57:49.928" style="s2"> In the beginning it was &quot;You hurt me, I will retaliate with hurt&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.199" end="01:57:51.410" style="s2"> And then &quot;You hurt me</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.172" end="01:57:53.623" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you and six other people.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.470" end="01:57:57.047" style="s2"> Then developed to</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.318" end="01:58:00.376" style="s2"> &quot;Not 7 people killed but 70 people&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.003" end="01:58:02.047" style="s2"> So there is a view</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.088" end="01:58:07.568" style="s2"> Once the first seed of murder is planted</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.351" end="01:58:12.610" style="s2"> It will grow exponentially</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.090" end="01:58:14.155" style="s2"> This is a warning</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.834" end="01:58:17.099" style="s2"> This is why I think Tubal Cain</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.537" end="01:58:18.946" style="s2"> This descendant of Cain</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.719" end="01:58:22.882" style="s2"> Was the first to make weapons of war</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.813" end="01:58:32.151" style="s2"> The story about Cain and Abel is almost told</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.537" end="01:58:36.055" style="s2"> As far as I am concerned, this story is not trivial</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.566" end="01:58:39.552" style="s2"> I think this story is always worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.214" end="01:58:46.170" style="s2"> Because there are too many angles to interpret it</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.944" end="01:58:55.522" style="s2"> I think the point revealed by these angles is</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.234" end="01:58:58.727" style="s2"> The potential of this story</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.727" end="01:58:59.614" style="s2"> Once understood</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.729" end="01:59:04.896" style="s2"> Not only will you recognize your failure</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.095" end="01:59:08.988" style="s2"> Or to recognize your rejection by being</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.063" end="01:59:17.976" style="s2"> And recognize your tendency to murder the best</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.257" end="01:59:19.740" style="s2"> And the tendency to murder the best in your own heart</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.888" end="01:59:25.178" style="s2"> Just for revenge</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.047" end="01:59:28.957" style="s2"> Because that means</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.646" end="01:59:31.838" style="s2"> We know that as Adam and Eve committed the original sin</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.140" end="01:59:34.646" style="s2"> The knowledge of good and evil has also come to the world</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.512" end="01:59:36.149" style="s2"> Recognizing that tendency means that now</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.149" end="01:59:38.278" style="s2"> Humans not only have to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.552" end="01:59:40.888" style="s2"> Tragedy and suffering</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.984" end="01:59:48.310" style="s2"> Even sacrificing properly is in vain</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.310" end="01:59:52.036" style="s2"> And bring real malice into the world</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.953" end="02:00:00.220" style="s2"> So there is a &quot;degenerate&quot; into history</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.554" end="02:00:05.188" style="s2"> Then I discovered that sacrifice is a good medicine for &quot;depravity&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.585" end="02:00:06.869" style="s2"> Then look back and find</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.869" end="02:00:09.479" style="s2"> Malicious appearance</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.178" end="02:00:12.422" style="s2"> Became a sacrificed enemy</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.905" end="02:00:17.485" style="s2"> That’s the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.779" end="02:00:21.963" style="s2"> This lecture comes to an end, thank you everyone</p>
