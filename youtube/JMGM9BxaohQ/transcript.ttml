<p begin="00:00:07.760" end="00:00:15.299" style="s2">so now what I want to do is try to give</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.460" end="00:00:18.810" style="s2">you a little idea of some of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.299" end="00:00:23.700" style="s2">that we have organized this first summer</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.810" end="00:00:28.950" style="s2">soul experience in order to address some</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.700" end="00:00:32.789" style="s2">of that larger vision now have this</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.950" end="00:00:36.260" style="s2">little diagram I made this morning which</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.789" end="00:00:36.260" style="s2">I hope you can see</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.040" end="00:01:08.300" style="s2">so we&#39;ve designed the experience the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.410" end="00:01:16.600" style="s2">learning experience at all the law</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.300" end="00:01:16.600" style="s2">around three primary modes of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.750" end="00:01:27.670" style="s2">educational experience and I see this as</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.500" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">a generative process that that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.670" end="00:01:34.520" style="s2">process enables improvement in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:36.619" style="s2">process which enables improvement in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.520" end="00:01:42.890" style="s2">this process and really generates a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.619" end="00:01:48.229" style="s2">whole learning experience so one part</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.890" end="00:01:53.720" style="s2">one stream of the experience is has to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.229" end="00:01:58.729" style="s2">do with research the ability to come up</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.720" end="00:02:04.549" style="s2">with novel questions about that are not</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.729" end="00:02:11.410" style="s2">that are not gnomes and to start a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.549" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">process of active inquiry and research</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.410" end="00:02:22.930" style="s2">in a way that moves that question along</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:26.120" style="s2">and the way that we support the research</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.930" end="00:02:29.150" style="s2">of the student is through insight</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.120" end="00:02:33.350" style="s2">practice because you can&#39;t ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.150" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2">of the unknown without having at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.350" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">some insight some insight as to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">hypothesis or a proposition or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">relevant question and that what that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.959" end="00:02:53.819" style="s2">looks like my marrow</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">is collective insight we do collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:03:00.209" style="s2">insight practice here at at all the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">all the lawyers the home of all dolor</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.209" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">insight center students engage in what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">call contemplative science because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:15.629" style="s2">a science to do research but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">contemplative aspect of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:22.160" style="s2">ability to watch into compo contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">and be self-reflective of one&#39;s in sight</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.160" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">process and why does it matter so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">generates novel questions and novel</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:37.140" style="s2">approaches to a research project so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:42.079" style="s2">have contemplative science collected</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.140" end="00:03:42.079" style="s2">inside practice and the research</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.680" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">the other process stream is a project</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">stream so in order to do the research it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">needs to be designed into a project so a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">project could be a multimedia project it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:09.000" style="s2">could be an interview project it could</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:12.299" style="s2">be a research traditional academic</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.000" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">research project working through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.299" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">internet it could be a building project</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.530" end="00:04:22.229" style="s2">an actual physical project to answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">some questions and experimental set set</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:31.340" style="s2">up so we have a project stream now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:34.110" style="s2">project stream one of the skills that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.340" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">you need to cultivate to support a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.110" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">project stream is embodied leadership</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:44.449" style="s2">because with a project you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:47.099" style="s2">to access and gather resources and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.449" end="00:04:50.099" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to do that by just</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.099" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">having contemplative insight you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.099" end="00:04:53.639" style="s2">some embodied leadership you need to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:56.550" style="s2">out in the world and interview people</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.639" end="00:04:58.889" style="s2">you need to go out into the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.550" end="00:05:05.010" style="s2">get resources for your experiment or</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.889" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">your built project and that projects in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.010" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">evitable create a living center or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:14.849" style="s2">community of practice so that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:17.310" style="s2">process dream is the project embodied</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.849" end="00:05:19.259" style="s2">leadership in the community the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.310" end="00:05:21.870" style="s2">community that you&#39;re leading in an</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.259" end="00:05:30.440" style="s2">embodied way in order to achieve your</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.870" end="00:05:34.380" style="s2">project so those are quite academic and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.440" end="00:05:37.020" style="s2">scientific and challenging in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.380" end="00:05:38.730" style="s2">an intellectual way but the third</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.020" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">process dream I think has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.730" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">increasingly important and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:46.590" style="s2">something that&#39;s left tradition left out</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:50.150" style="s2">of almost all educational design and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.590" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">that is practice or practical or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.150" end="00:05:57.660" style="s2">practicum so you can&#39;t just do a project</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:06:01.130" style="s2">all of a sudden you&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.660" end="00:06:04.530" style="s2">once it just shows up now that&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:07.290" style="s2">institutional situations where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.530" end="00:06:10.200" style="s2">institution will throw resources and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.290" end="00:06:14.520" style="s2">support and really do all the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.200" end="00:06:16.770" style="s2">you can give the student the the sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.520" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">or at least the false sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.770" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">project is being led by them but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:27.300" style="s2">real way that research projects and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">action gets done in the world we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.300" end="00:06:33.210" style="s2">requires a lot of practice and when</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:36.360" style="s2">students are robbed of the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.210" end="00:06:39.300" style="s2">practice they are robbed of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.360" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">opportunity to develop the skill set</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.300" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">that they need to face an unknown future</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.900" end="00:06:51.330" style="s2">so practice life underneath practice I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.600" end="00:06:53.160" style="s2">put echo awareness and certainly here at</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.330" end="00:06:56.100" style="s2">all the Lord we meet ecological</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.160" end="00:07:00.390" style="s2">awareness because designing and doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.100" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">practice in the in the new world has to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.390" end="00:07:07.500" style="s2">do with being ecologically aware but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:10.380" style="s2">also mean it in terms of systems view or</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.500" end="00:07:13.200" style="s2">ecological systems view because if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.380" end="00:07:16.320" style="s2">have a systems view of your practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.200" end="00:07:18.870" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to inform better inform</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.320" end="00:07:22.290" style="s2">and better generate or engineer or</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.870" end="00:07:25.230" style="s2">design your project so the practice is</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.290" end="00:07:29.640" style="s2">of echo awareness and how things fit</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.230" end="00:07:33.000" style="s2">into the system and to really bring that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.640" end="00:07:35.850" style="s2">down into your life skills so that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:37.710" style="s2">being ecologically aware of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.850" end="00:07:41.640" style="s2">entire system both human and non-human</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.710" end="00:07:44.010" style="s2">as a practice and making that real right</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.640" end="00:07:45.760" style="s2">down in terms of your life school skills</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.010" end="00:07:51.690" style="s2">is the practice that makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.760" end="00:07:57.570" style="s2">project practical so those are the three</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.690" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">streams that are all the lower soul is</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.570" end="00:08:06.390" style="s2">built upon and these three are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.590" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">generating and self-organizing a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.390" end="00:08:16.270" style="s2">profound learning experience we can look</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:19.030" style="s2">at each one of these three streams in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.270" end="00:08:22.930" style="s2">different way so that for example this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.030" end="00:08:26.650" style="s2">stream contemplative science being the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.930" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">core which generates insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">research I put as a stream of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:38.280" style="s2">understanding so the goal of this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:42.340" style="s2">understanding in the skill or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.280" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">competency that it intends is clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.340" end="00:08:53.140" style="s2">purpose so you can see how these all</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:59.290" style="s2">work to build more clarity of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.140" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s the stream of understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:05.860" style="s2">what are some of the particulars in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:09.580" style="s2">street clarity of purpose on deriving</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.860" end="00:09:12.760" style="s2">meaning being able to make these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.580" end="00:09:15.670" style="s2">more like core capacities being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.760" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">derive meaning make important and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.670" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">relevant distinctions discovering</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:28.200" style="s2">patterns and looking for innovation not</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.200" style="s2">to just repeat what&#39;s been done before</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:36.459" style="s2">in the project stream here we have at</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.980" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">the core the community and it which</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.459" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">requires the embodied leadership to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:49.269" style="s2">manifest your project and I call that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:55.500" style="s2">the leading stream to leave to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.269" end="00:09:58.029" style="s2">project manager and the capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.500" end="00:10:01.750" style="s2">this is cultivating is adequate</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.029" end="00:10:04.060" style="s2">participation so in order to gain</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.750" end="00:10:06.459" style="s2">insight into your research to really</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.060" end="00:10:09.490" style="s2">understand there&#39;s a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.459" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">participation that is required enough of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.490" end="00:10:15.130" style="s2">a real-life project enough leadership</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:19.899" style="s2">enough community adequate participation</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.130" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">in your project is the capacity that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.899" end="00:10:27.639" style="s2">being cultivated in that stream and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:30.490" style="s2">we look at core skills the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.639" end="00:10:33.870" style="s2">its enactment skills the ability to take</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.240" end="00:12:11.029" style="s2">also something that is being left out in</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.640" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">education today that students can have a</p>
