<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">in Democrats horrible especially around</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.410" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">the discussion of blue church and red</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">really coming up and he spent a good bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">of time writing about his his a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:45.329" style="s2">viewpoint and situational assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">the world that we live in today and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">are going to just jump right to it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">so Jordan thank you very much I really</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">appreciate you coming on better welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">it&#39;s my pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">all right awesome so one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">ways that I came across your writing was</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">with the situational assessment Trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">version and so I went I read that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">and then I went back to the 2015 one and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:08.060" style="s2">if we could just sort of introduce the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">listeners to the concepts of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.060" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">included in the situational assessments</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:13.950" style="s2">I think that&#39;d be a great place to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">like how how did you come to write those</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of my first question and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">was your motivation and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">maybe if we could just sort of break</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">down some of the basic concepts were in</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">there and then sort of move forward and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:27.869" style="s2">apply it to the world today sure so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">think probably the best way to begin is</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.869" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">just to to begin with the proposition</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:37.470" style="s2">that I happen to be a somewhat unusual</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">person certainly somewhere on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">spectrum and had a childhood that was I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">think largely partaking of what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.700" style="s2">might consider late 70s early 80s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">nerd culture so I had a very healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.700" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">dose of say Dungeons and Dragons and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">comic books and science fiction and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">science and early computers so I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:59.299" style="s2">actually involved with computers as soon</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">as pcs happened and all the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.299" end="00:02:05.610" style="s2">dense that make someone&#39;s personality in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">psychology but in in in kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">language that Eric Weinstein has used in</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">order to simply survive in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">that I found myself and I had to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:17.660" style="s2">out how to build</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:20.100" style="s2">a kind of a bespoke sense making</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.660" end="00:02:22.290" style="s2">capacity just to just to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.100" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">what the hell was going on around me</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.290" end="00:02:25.710" style="s2">the tools that were headed to me just</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t work so I had to start getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.710" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">pretty good at building my own tools and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:33.080" style="s2">please sure so since making is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna talk a lot about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.080" end="00:02:37.350" style="s2">can we can we define what that means I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:39.740" style="s2">think it sounds sort of self-evident but</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.350" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a lot more to it sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.740" end="00:02:46.740" style="s2">so what we can do is we can say that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:47.880" style="s2">the beginning there&#39;s perception well in</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.740" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">the beginning there&#39;s reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.880" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">so you&#39;re find yourself in reality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:54.810" style="s2">one of the things I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">maybe notice is that reality is is vast</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.810" end="00:02:59.130" style="s2">and reality is mysterious I actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">oftentimes use William James phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.130" end="00:03:03.860" style="s2">blooming buzzing confusion and if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">really just allow yourself to notice</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.860" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">reality is much more complex than we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:10.530" style="s2">adults when we give it credit for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:11.670" style="s2">know watch a small child in reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.530" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a sense of it so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.670" end="00:03:16.200" style="s2">beginning there&#39;s reality and in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:17.610" style="s2">context of reality as an individual your</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.200" end="00:03:18.780" style="s2">first person experience is the you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.610" end="00:03:20.269" style="s2">notice you&#39;ll be having some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.780" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">experience you&#39;ll be proceeding things</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.269" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">and your perceptions are of course a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">aren&#39;t the notion of five senses is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.540" style="s2">old story there&#39;s thousands so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:31.560" style="s2">got a lot of different perceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.540" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">one of the things that you&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.560" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">deal with is that you have vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:37.769" style="s2">perceptions than you can possibly deal</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.700" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">with to make choices so the objective is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.769" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">to figure out how to be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:48.120" style="s2">with reality in a way that is misused</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.670" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">evolutionary language whoa are you still</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.120" end="00:03:52.830" style="s2">there I am still here hold on my</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">somebody&#39;s trying to call me on FaceTime</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.830" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">and somehow that has priority over all</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:04:00.300" style="s2">the rest of my computer haha good ol</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">Apple yeah that&#39;s no problem would just</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.300" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">keeping it real last time I had no</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">sirens and dogs barking so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:09.630" style="s2">frightening me although it&#39;s so so if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:12.209" style="s2">could just interject real quick so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.630" end="00:04:13.260" style="s2">what you said five senses we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.209" end="00:04:15.330" style="s2">more than that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.260" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">I&#39;ve read that you had written was that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.330" end="00:04:20.250" style="s2">the body senses things much more so than</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:21.510" style="s2">the you know our prefrontal cortex and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.250" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I actually wrote</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.510" end="00:04:26.700" style="s2">quite a bit about in the book as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">too so what can you can you tie those</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">two concepts the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:31.110" style="s2">then also you&#39;d mentioned that your</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:33.030" style="s2">sense maker you felt was broken and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">was born in the mid 70s and I too was</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.030" end="00:04:38.190" style="s2">his product of you know early media and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">70s and 80s I played Dungeons Dragons</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.190" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">comic books I played on Commodore 64</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:46.200" style="s2">computers I remember saving saving</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2">programs on audio cassettes they and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.200" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">know I wrote 10 you know print print</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:51.930" style="s2">jack 20 go to 10 I thought it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.330" style="s2">great greatest thing ever in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.930" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">world so I played with basic from you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.330" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">know early on and my dad actually was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">data processing guy and so I had access</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:02.730" style="s2">to email in like the 80s and so he he</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:04.530" style="s2">used me as a way to be like well can</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.730" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">these other guys you know is this easy</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.530" end="00:05:08.580" style="s2">enough for professionals to you so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:10.890" style="s2">been sort of in the similar situation as</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.580" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">you and I feel like my sense makers</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.890" end="00:05:15.450" style="s2">broken too so maybe if you could explain</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">what that sensation was for you and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.450" end="00:05:20.280" style="s2">maybe tie it also together with our</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:22.890" style="s2">powers of perception of this vast sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:25.980" style="s2">of reality that&#39;s out there store okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.890" end="00:05:27.240" style="s2">so so we&#39;ve got perception and just to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">very quickly speak to the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.240" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">body I think anybody who has learned</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">some kind of embodied skill like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">juggling or even just catching might</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">have maybe even a sense of wonder at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:41.130" style="s2">fact that you can throw and catch a ball</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">that&#39;s a serious deal like try</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:46.650" style="s2">to have you ever try to do the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.820" style="s2">math it&#39;s not trivial right and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.650" end="00:05:50.370" style="s2">there&#39;s no freaking way that your</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.820" end="00:05:52.650" style="s2">prefrontal cortex is doing differential</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.370" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">equations to estimate the projection of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.650" end="00:05:56.580" style="s2">a ball in the air but your body has the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">capacity to relatively quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.580" end="00:05:59.640" style="s2">multiply effortlessly learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:00.600" style="s2">that and then of course if you spend</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.640" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">some time at it do some really</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.600" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">interesting things yeah it&#39;s only and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:05.130" style="s2">even children have look how hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.690" end="00:06:06.780" style="s2">that I mean I played catch with my son</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.130" end="00:06:09.210" style="s2">since he was a little kid and he can</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.780" end="00:06:10.710" style="s2">gauge 20v 3340 I mean it&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.210" end="00:06:12.030" style="s2">it&#39;s incredible right so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.710" end="00:06:14.130" style="s2">one piece so the recognition is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.030" end="00:06:16.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain vastness to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.130" end="00:06:18.480" style="s2">possibility of perception and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.290" end="00:06:20.760" style="s2">find ourselves in the world with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.480" end="00:06:22.860" style="s2">almost instantaneous need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.760" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">how to to deal with the world to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.860" end="00:06:26.520" style="s2">navigate as an infant you have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.500" style="s2">out how to do things like move food</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:29.670" style="s2">through this tube of your body in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.500" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">that causes as little pain as possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.670" end="00:06:34.770" style="s2">and then keep it coming in the front end</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:35.970" style="s2">right so we are immediately cast into</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.770" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">having to figure out how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.970" end="00:06:39.870" style="s2">and so this notion of sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:41.100" style="s2">just saying okay I have reality I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.870" end="00:06:44.010" style="s2">my perception of reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.100" end="00:06:46.350" style="s2">how do I make sense of that perception</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.010" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">how do I convert or compress that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.350" end="00:06:53.160" style="s2">vastness of perception into things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:56.580" style="s2">I can do with that will help me make</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.160" end="00:06:58.650" style="s2">effective choices in the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.580" end="00:07:00.120" style="s2">and we could talk about this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.650" end="00:07:02.970" style="s2">very step-by-step like literally the eye</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.120" end="00:07:05.910" style="s2">the retina is a process that converts</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.970" end="00:07:07.500" style="s2">the broad spectrum light that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.910" end="00:07:09.750" style="s2">literally bouncing off the back of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.500" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">retina into just that subset of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.750" end="00:07:13.980" style="s2">frequency of electromagnetic radiation</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:16.110" style="s2">that the retinal cells can be sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.980" end="00:07:17.850" style="s2">to into the subset of that that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.110" end="00:07:19.620" style="s2">optic nerve brings into the visual</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.850" end="00:07:20.970" style="s2">cortex and then the visual cortex of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.620" end="00:07:24.030" style="s2">course was doing a huge amount of work</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.970" end="00:07:25.950" style="s2">trying to take this raw signal from two</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.030" end="00:07:28.290" style="s2">different eyes and then convert that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.950" end="00:07:30.330" style="s2">into the stuff that we see or that least</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.290" end="00:07:32.580" style="s2">we have the capacity to choose to see if</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.330" end="00:07:34.020" style="s2">we point our attention at it and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.580" end="00:07:35.340" style="s2">then it&#39;s course percolating through</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.020" end="00:07:38.010" style="s2">other parts of the brain to try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.340" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">identify what matters in what we see I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.010" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2">said this making a process from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:44.670" style="s2">point of vision right and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.380" end="00:07:46.980" style="s2">themes I think well you just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.670" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">was filtering - right like massively</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.980" end="00:07:52.920" style="s2">yeah massively massively massively right</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of what&#39;s being affected</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.920" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">in many ways I mean I&#39;m not gonna jump</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:57.510" style="s2">ahead here but like media filtering</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.370" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">information your body filtering</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.510" end="00:08:00.660" style="s2">information everything is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:02.040" style="s2">filtering this infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.660" end="00:08:03.960" style="s2">information to figure out what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.040" end="00:08:07.170" style="s2">accurate what is important relevant</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.960" end="00:08:09.480" style="s2">useful all right interesting signals is</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.170" end="00:08:14.210" style="s2">is that relevant to sense making like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.480" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">your filtering capabilities what&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.210" end="00:08:20.250" style="s2">irreducible almost all the perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:23.910" style="s2">thrown away so the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.250" end="00:08:26.760" style="s2">discerning is your filtering to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.910" end="00:08:28.230" style="s2">degree are you identifying the aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.760" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">reality that is meaningful and to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.230" end="00:08:31.890" style="s2">degree are you throwing away the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.300" end="00:08:32.700" style="s2">of reality they&#39;re not meaningful given</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.890" end="00:08:36.930" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re throwing away</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.700" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">almost all of it so you so so that&#39;s big</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">right so let&#39;s listen maybe do two</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:43.169" style="s2">things at once so one is my personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">experience was one where</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.169" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessary that my cents miracle</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:08:48.930" style="s2">was broken but rather that culture the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">culture that I had been born into heard</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.930" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">the society that I had been born into</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">had a particular way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.649" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">accelerate the development of my sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.180" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">making giving me frameworks education</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:04.350" style="s2">and looked and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:07.529" style="s2">that didn&#39;t work for me and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.350" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">prefab toolkit that our culture to some</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.529" end="00:09:11.550" style="s2">extent that tries to give to the younger</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.930" end="00:09:15.269" style="s2">generation to the ginger generation has</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.550" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">tools that it can use just didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.269" end="00:09:19.350" style="s2">for me so I found myself in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:22.500" style="s2">circumstance where I had to do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.350" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">I had more fully sort of ended as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.500" end="00:09:26.670" style="s2">individual step into reality and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:30.360" style="s2">build my own since making frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.670" end="00:09:31.529" style="s2">bespoke and this showed up a lot for</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.360" end="00:09:33.420" style="s2">example in the notion of being an</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.529" end="00:09:35.730" style="s2">entrepreneur as opposed to say being a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.420" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">businessman businessman is somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.730" end="00:09:41.160" style="s2">can for whom the machine works who can</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">step into a place turn certain cranks</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.160" end="00:09:45.329" style="s2">and be able to do that with with what</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:49.110" style="s2">Eric calls excellence and often times</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.329" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">entrepreneurs or people who can&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.110" end="00:09:51.750" style="s2">literally that road is just not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">meaningfully available to them and on</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.750" end="00:09:56.790" style="s2">the flip side if they have gotten to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">point of some level of adaptive capacity</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.790" end="00:09:59.850" style="s2">if their own bespoke sense making has</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:02.190" style="s2">gotten to a high enough level</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.850" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">zaiah can also see things that other</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.190" end="00:10:07.230" style="s2">people can&#39;t see and can and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.240" style="s2">actually have to have have learned how</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.230" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">to be willing to take risks because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.240" end="00:10:13.019" style="s2">easy path wasn&#39;t available like they</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:14.820" style="s2">couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t just learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.019" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">schools teaching we had to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:18.570" style="s2">stake out new ground and so for me being</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:22.649" style="s2">an entrepreneur being a tech</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.570" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">entrepreneur was part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.649" end="00:10:27.060" style="s2">process and I was using a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:28.949" style="s2">same developing frameworks that bespoke</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.060" end="00:10:32.190" style="s2">sense-making in that same context I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.949" end="00:10:34.620" style="s2">making sense of the inner the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.190" end="00:10:37.620" style="s2">relationship between digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.620" end="00:10:40.949" style="s2">and the analog world to try to identify</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.620" end="00:10:43.790" style="s2">where opportunities might lie and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.949" end="00:10:46.290" style="s2">for example networking technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.790" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">intrinsically changes the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.290" end="00:10:53.300" style="s2">between people and how power human</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:54.889" style="s2">relationships congregate and create</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.300" end="00:10:57.619" style="s2">groups that may</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.889" end="00:11:00.649" style="s2">choices together differently than what</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.619" end="00:11:02.869" style="s2">happens in a place where say broadcasts</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.649" end="00:11:04.220" style="s2">television so noticing that like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.869" end="00:11:06.049" style="s2">literally just being there present - has</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.220" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">it evolved from watching how it changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.049" end="00:11:09.799" style="s2">and then in my mind trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:11.239" style="s2">why like building framework to try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.799" end="00:11:14.089" style="s2">explain what I was observing in my life</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.239" end="00:11:16.999" style="s2">and that I was having to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.089" end="00:11:18.980" style="s2">because that was the the my job my my</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.999" end="00:11:19.910" style="s2">job is actually to be good at figuring</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.980" end="00:11:22.069" style="s2">out how these things were going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.910" end="00:11:23.989" style="s2">happen and having my skin in the game if</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.069" end="00:11:26.899" style="s2">I made a bad choice as an entrepreneur I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.989" end="00:11:30.410" style="s2">was going to lose so the the adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.899" end="00:11:34.069" style="s2">framework was was stark and so yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.410" end="00:11:36.230" style="s2">happened and in 2007 I exited my my</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.069" end="00:11:39.529" style="s2">third company DivX and more or less</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.230" end="00:11:41.689" style="s2">retired and spent a lot of time just</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.529" end="00:11:45.889" style="s2">just watching and learning and just</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.689" end="00:11:47.299" style="s2">exploring the world with my I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.889" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">say he&#39;ll gotten gains my well deserved</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.299" end="00:11:54.259" style="s2">became well deserved and and on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:56.449" style="s2">note I think I read also that you were</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.259" end="00:11:58.790" style="s2">one of the few people to start up get</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.449" end="00:12:01.129" style="s2">initial offering and then bring public</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.790" end="00:12:04.279" style="s2">companies that right yes that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.129" end="00:12:06.470" style="s2">yeah I was involved in three startups</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.279" end="00:12:10.790" style="s2">that were from beginning all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.470" end="00:12:12.980" style="s2">I P oh and the third I was the you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.790" end="00:12:15.679" style="s2">co-founder and CEO up and it went from</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.980" end="00:12:17.629" style="s2">an IPO on NASDAQ so from zero from</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.679" end="00:12:20.329" style="s2">nothingness all the way to idea which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.629" end="00:12:22.249" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a fun game all right I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.329" end="00:12:24.230" style="s2">think that&#39;s that speaks to your ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.249" end="00:12:26.329" style="s2">to create new frameworks and move</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.230" end="00:12:27.350" style="s2">through those different different zones</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.329" end="00:12:30.169" style="s2">that you were talking about which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.350" end="00:12:33.319" style="s2">like the visionary versus the day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.169" end="00:12:34.999" style="s2">businessman right and I pick just to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.319" end="00:12:36.230" style="s2">keep a little bit more sharpness to it I</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.999" end="00:12:38.269" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;m particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.230" end="00:12:40.249" style="s2">at it so to the degree to which there</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.269" end="00:12:43.850" style="s2">was any success it an earth to both</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.249" end="00:12:45.499" style="s2">lucky timing and to maybe some some</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.850" end="00:12:49.579" style="s2">insight that was helpful like giving an</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.499" end="00:12:51.439" style="s2">advantage so I spent a lot of time like</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.579" end="00:12:53.539" style="s2">I really delve deep into all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.439" end="00:12:56.179" style="s2">interesting things like complex system</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.539" end="00:12:57.410" style="s2">science and whatnot and the financial</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.179" end="00:12:58.939" style="s2">crisis that happened right afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.410" end="00:13:02.389" style="s2">gave me a very interesting opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.939" end="00:13:03.829" style="s2">to get a sense of yet another taste and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.389" end="00:13:06.110" style="s2">I was involved in say the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.829" end="00:13:08.650" style="s2">crypto with Bitcoin not too long after</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.110" end="00:13:14.290" style="s2">watch that as it evolved</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.650" end="00:13:17.980" style="s2">and as the 2016 election started to play</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.290" end="00:13:19.330" style="s2">out some friends I just noticed it as of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.980" end="00:13:23.320" style="s2">the conversations with friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.330" end="00:13:26.740" style="s2">that I had a perspective that a they</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.320" end="00:13:29.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t share and B they thought was</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.740" end="00:13:31.690" style="s2">actually rather interesting and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.470" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">like the straight truth in order to just</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.690" end="00:13:36.490" style="s2">simplify my life so that I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">to repeat the same story to many people</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.490" end="00:13:42.130" style="s2">i sat down and about seven hours cranked</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:46.030" style="s2">out the first situational assessment</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.130" end="00:13:47.590" style="s2">2017 medium post with the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.030" end="00:13:49.570" style="s2">basic sense that I would get I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.590" end="00:13:51.580" style="s2">know 500 or 600 people would read it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:56.860" style="s2">it may or may not be somewhat youthful</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.580" end="00:13:59.170" style="s2">to them 20 2015 I think right no no 2017</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.860" end="00:14:02.920" style="s2">I had written a previous one in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.170" end="00:14:06.400" style="s2">that was a different kind of object it</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.920" end="00:14:09.940" style="s2">had a different arms so 2017 this is 19</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.400" end="00:14:11.500" style="s2">yeah 2017 was Trump Edition right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.940" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">was little just laying out hey here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.500" end="00:14:15.970" style="s2">the way I&#39;m thinking about this story</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:17.740" style="s2">and as it turns out that was well</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.970" end="00:14:21.880" style="s2">received like about a quarter of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.740" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">million people read it and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.880" end="00:14:24.640" style="s2">kind of go from there that&#39;s that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:27.340" style="s2">of the story that brings us to the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.640" end="00:14:31.180" style="s2">of how that particular object was or why</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.340" end="00:14:33.660" style="s2">was created right you know if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.180" end="00:14:36.640" style="s2">reading the 2015 version you laid out</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.660" end="00:14:40.270" style="s2">four elements about the future I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.640" end="00:14:42.640" style="s2">if I can recall them Muslim push back</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.270" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">against globalism strain and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">financial markets and a couple of others</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">that I believed sort of evolved directly</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:52.330" style="s2">into the 2017 version where I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:55.300" style="s2">reading the 2015 version and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.330" end="00:14:58.960" style="s2">to myself he predicted the rise of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.300" end="00:15:00.400" style="s2">trump-like figure in 2015 and in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.960" end="00:15:03.520" style="s2">you were writing is sort of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.400" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">why did you yes did you feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.520" end="00:15:10.660" style="s2">trump-like figure was on his way as</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:15.930" style="s2">early as 2015 well I would say that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.660" end="00:15:15.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve expected a trump-like figure since</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.630" end="00:15:27.400" style="s2">we mean 1996 okay and it&#39;s not I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.760" end="00:15:29.860" style="s2">some sense is pretty obvious so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.400" end="00:15:32.590" style="s2">just a matter of having a model or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.860" end="00:15:37.840" style="s2">framework that tries to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.590" end="00:15:41.170" style="s2">how culture evolves and how politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.840" end="00:15:43.930" style="s2">which of course is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.170" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">epiphenomena of culture shows up in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.930" end="00:15:48.850" style="s2">context so I can go into that if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:50.650" style="s2">like but we can yeah I would love that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.850" end="00:15:53.260" style="s2">also could you explain the word a people</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.650" end="00:15:54.700" style="s2">phenomenon Carl no it&#39;s totally fine I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.260" end="00:15:56.110" style="s2">think I&#39;ve read it a million times but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.700" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use it confidently in</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:16:00.190" style="s2">conversation and you know my listeners</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">are very smart people and they come from</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.190" end="00:16:04.360" style="s2">walks all of all different walks of life</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">but you know we&#39;re all about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.360" end="00:16:09.070" style="s2">learn as much as we can and to help us</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:10.690" style="s2">make sense right that&#39;s what this sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.070" end="00:16:12.460" style="s2">of like the old gist of the podcast so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.690" end="00:16:14.620" style="s2">makes sense of the world so that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.460" end="00:16:17.640" style="s2">that&#39;s right so what do you mean what do</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.620" end="00:16:19.420" style="s2">you mean of that culture is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.640" end="00:16:22.840" style="s2">epiphenomena politics is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.420" end="00:16:24.550" style="s2">epiphenomenon of culture what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.840" end="00:16:29.500" style="s2">that that culture is more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.550" end="00:16:32.440" style="s2">and that politics arises you might even</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.500" end="00:16:35.050" style="s2">say like on the surface of culture so</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.440" end="00:16:38.080" style="s2">that while politics is real and has its</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.050" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">own characteristics and feeds back on</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.080" end="00:16:45.280" style="s2">culture right politics can shift culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:46.540" style="s2">culture is more fundamental okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.280" end="00:16:49.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve also heard that quote several</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.540" end="00:16:52.180" style="s2">times that politics is down stream down</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.930" end="00:16:54.420" style="s2">from culture yeah this is a very another</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.180" end="00:16:57.280" style="s2">way of saying the same thing except that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.420" end="00:16:58.810" style="s2">that maybe implies that politics has no</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.280" end="00:16:59.620" style="s2">capacity to shift culture and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.810" end="00:17:01.780" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.620" end="00:17:04.660" style="s2">these things are very complex they</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.780" end="00:17:06.520" style="s2">relate to each other right so what was</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.660" end="00:17:07.750" style="s2">it in 2017 what were the issues that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.520" end="00:17:09.640" style="s2">were seeing let&#39;s break down the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.750" end="00:17:11.230" style="s2">situational assessment because that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.640" end="00:17:13.209" style="s2">hugely influential to me I also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.230" end="00:17:15.130" style="s2">then into this sort of explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.209" end="00:17:17.880" style="s2">the blue church at that point so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.130" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">let&#39;s break that down the 2017</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.880" end="00:17:26.530" style="s2">situational assessment okay so I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:28.270" style="s2">probably the best way to start is to to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.530" end="00:17:29.660" style="s2">acknowledge that I have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.270" end="00:17:36.860" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.660" end="00:17:38.870" style="s2">that well history happens that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.860" end="00:17:43.190" style="s2">first and what I mean by that is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.870" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">that changes things that were going</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.190" end="00:17:46.850" style="s2">along for maybe a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">suddenly stop being around and new</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.850" end="00:17:50.690" style="s2">things happen I found I had to be very</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:52.970" style="s2">clear about that because I noticed many</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.690" end="00:17:55.250" style="s2">people mostly people from the political</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.970" end="00:17:56.510" style="s2">class didn&#39;t seem to have that notion</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.250" end="00:17:58.700" style="s2">right for some reason they seem to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.510" end="00:18:00.260" style="s2">that what happened last year is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.700" end="00:18:01.910" style="s2">gonna happen next year so being aware of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.260" end="00:18:03.710" style="s2">the fact that sometimes things are</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.910" end="00:18:06.200" style="s2">different sometimes things really do</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.710" end="00:18:07.220" style="s2">change and when they change they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.200" end="00:18:09.040" style="s2">often times change in quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.220" end="00:18:12.140" style="s2">unpredictable ways so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.040" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">proposition the second proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.140" end="00:18:18.560" style="s2">that we right now are part of a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.950" end="00:18:19.970" style="s2">large change many different large</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.560" end="00:18:22.220" style="s2">changes and they&#39;re all kind of building</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.970" end="00:18:24.290" style="s2">to a big one so I think of it as perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.220" end="00:18:27.500" style="s2">say a big a big wave that is breaking or</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.290" end="00:18:29.660" style="s2">a big bubble that is popping or you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.500" end="00:18:30.800" style="s2">to be really poetic a big bubble on top</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.660" end="00:18:33.250" style="s2">of the big wave that is both clapping</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.800" end="00:18:36.020" style="s2">breaking at the same time it&#39;s that big</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.250" end="00:18:38.090" style="s2">so for me the process was trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.020" end="00:18:39.530" style="s2">deep and this is why the thing is called</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.090" end="00:18:41.630" style="s2">deep code like go deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.530" end="00:18:43.610" style="s2">until you could find what might be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.630" end="00:18:45.680" style="s2">more fundamental things that are showing</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.610" end="00:18:47.570" style="s2">up as the generator functions or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.680" end="00:18:50.570" style="s2">causes that are giving rise to what</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.570" end="00:18:52.910" style="s2">we&#39;re witnessing on the surface you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.570" end="00:18:55.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit like noticing it&#39;s raining</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.910" end="00:18:57.350" style="s2">and then perhaps building meteorology as</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.910" end="00:18:59.240" style="s2">a science so you can actually explain</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.350" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">why it&#39;s raining and maybe when it might</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.240" end="00:19:03.500" style="s2">rain next it&#39;s something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:07.130" style="s2">right right and and just for my</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.500" end="00:19:09.920" style="s2">listeners I think your general thesis is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.130" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">is what that were at a existential</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.920" end="00:19:15.080" style="s2">moment in humanity all these factors are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:17.300" style="s2">going to talk about have come have come</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.080" end="00:19:19.570" style="s2">together to create an inflection point</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.300" end="00:19:21.680" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna lead to something entirely</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.570" end="00:19:24.860" style="s2">altogether new maybe terrible maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.680" end="00:19:27.110" style="s2">wonderful yes yeah my the way I may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.860" end="00:19:31.970" style="s2">making it simply is that if we almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.110" end="00:19:33.470" style="s2">like a Richter scale of change you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.970" end="00:19:35.510" style="s2">say like you have a category one event</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.470" end="00:19:37.420" style="s2">that is a tenure change in a category to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.510" end="00:19:41.630" style="s2">attend then is a hundred year change</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.420" end="00:19:43.340" style="s2">where I would say with confidence at at</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.630" end="00:19:45.470" style="s2">least a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.340" end="00:19:49.460" style="s2">thousand year change right it&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.470" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">of change that happened between medieval</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.460" end="00:19:56.210" style="s2">Europe and modern Europe or between the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:20:00.170" style="s2">fall of Rome and the rise of Western</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.210" end="00:20:01.850" style="s2">civilization I actually believe that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.170" end="00:20:05.740" style="s2">we&#39;re at at least a ten thousand year</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.850" end="00:20:09.920" style="s2">change so the shift from pre</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:12.830" style="s2">civilization from tribal based human</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.920" end="00:20:15.740" style="s2">level organization to city state</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.830" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">agriculture style human organization and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.740" end="00:20:19.850" style="s2">possibly even larger of course at that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">point becomes very difficult to to to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.850" end="00:20:24.350" style="s2">think about it but you have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:27.730" style="s2">transition say for example from homo</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.350" end="00:20:30.230" style="s2">erectus to homo sapiens which is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.730" end="00:20:35.230" style="s2">hundred thousand or a million year scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.230" end="00:20:38.120" style="s2">change and it&#39;s not it if you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.230" end="00:20:40.420" style="s2">if you take seriously the implications</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.120" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">of say artificial intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.420" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">CRISPR the notion that we may be very</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:51.020" style="s2">close to a threshold where we can we</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.670" style="s2">cannot help but change ourselves and our</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.020" end="00:20:54.410" style="s2">circumstances at a level that is at</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.670" end="00:20:57.020" style="s2">least equivalent to the shift that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.410" end="00:20:59.300" style="s2">occurred when Homo erectus turned into</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.020" end="00:21:01.580" style="s2">homo sapiens is actually not that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.300" end="00:21:02.990" style="s2">unusual the hard part I think is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.580" end="00:21:04.340" style="s2">actually digesting the reality dammit</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.990" end="00:21:05.690" style="s2">you can grasp it then you&#39;re like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.340" end="00:21:09.380" style="s2">well that&#39;s a lot what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.690" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">and I think being able to in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.380" end="00:21:16.310" style="s2">just go slow enough to allow the reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:19.810" style="s2">of what appears to be the case to settle</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.310" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">in is the real challenge like just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.810" end="00:21:25.340" style="s2">go too fast and don&#39;t foreclose that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:28.160" style="s2">possibility so this is the proposition</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.340" end="00:21:29.450" style="s2">is that we&#39;re right now faced with</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.160" end="00:21:30.890" style="s2">something that is let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.450" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">thousand-year level change which is big</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.890" end="00:21:34.490" style="s2">enough and it may even be all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:38.270" style="s2">to a million minute your level change</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.490" end="00:21:39.680" style="s2">which is you know quite big and so as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.270" end="00:21:42.110" style="s2">witness what&#39;s happening in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.680" end="00:21:43.880" style="s2">that gives us a context that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.110" end="00:21:46.490" style="s2">to perceive it and it&#39;s certainly really</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.880" end="00:21:48.530" style="s2">effective because this isn&#39;t something</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.490" end="00:21:50.360" style="s2">that&#39;s easy for humans to manage is it I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.530" end="00:21:52.040" style="s2">mean I just got a puppy and I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.360" end="00:21:53.990" style="s2">anxiety over the fact that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.040" end="00:21:55.820" style="s2">a new box in my life I live a group you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.990" end="00:21:56.590" style="s2">don&#39;t well yeah I mean think about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.820" end="00:22:00.549" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.590" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">as individuals you know oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.549" end="00:22:04.360" style="s2">decades and we don&#39;t live longer than</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:06.669" style="s2">about a hundred years so it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.360" end="00:22:08.350" style="s2">sensible for us to have built capacities</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.669" end="00:22:11.010" style="s2">to perceive changes that happened more</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.350" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">than a hundred years as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.010" end="00:22:17.830" style="s2">which is part of my big thesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:18.429" style="s2">that cultures have lasted longer than a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.830" end="00:22:21.279" style="s2">hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.429" end="00:22:23.950" style="s2">and so maybe cultures have some capacity</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.279" end="00:22:27.279" style="s2">built in over time to receive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.950" end="00:22:28.539" style="s2">respond to changes of that magnitude and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.279" end="00:22:31.059" style="s2">of course the genome has been around for</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.539" end="00:22:32.500" style="s2">a very long time so but now we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.059" end="00:22:35.289" style="s2">awfully deep so let&#39;s just zoom all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.500" end="00:22:38.380" style="s2">way back to the practical 2116 all right</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.289" end="00:22:41.880" style="s2">so let&#39;s take some some tools out of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.380" end="00:22:44.490" style="s2">out of the toolkit okay and the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.880" end="00:22:46.630" style="s2">proposition I would like to make is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.490" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">there are lots of different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.630" end="00:22:51.159" style="s2">and lots of different frameworks and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.270" style="s2">many of them are very useful none of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.159" end="00:22:53.950" style="s2">them are going to tell the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.270" end="00:22:55.510" style="s2">so what we should do is we should sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">of pull out our toolkit be aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:22:59.070" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re using a given toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:02.230" style="s2">see where it seems to be giving us</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.070" end="00:23:04.149" style="s2">useful perspective and and maybe pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">other tools to do other things so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.149" end="00:23:10.179" style="s2">start with one which is let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">relationship between technology and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.179" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">culture and society I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:19.409" style="s2">distinguished culture and society</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:21.669" style="s2">society here I&#39;m going to define as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.409" end="00:23:25.659" style="s2">institutional formal structures that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.669" end="00:23:28.059" style="s2">human beings used to get our needs met</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.659" end="00:23:30.730" style="s2">and navigate reality as a group alright</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.059" end="00:23:34.600" style="s2">so we currently live in a society where</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.730" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">we use fiat currency and interact with</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.600" end="00:23:38.529" style="s2">corporations for example like I go to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:41.649" style="s2">the grocery store to buy food so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.529" end="00:23:46.200" style="s2">a social function and then culture I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.649" end="00:23:51.429" style="s2">will define as the the complex process</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.200" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">whereby individual humans develop right</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.429" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s about human development going</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:59.159" style="s2">from birth to death in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:00.340" style="s2">nature and in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.159" end="00:24:02.590" style="s2">humaneness</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.340" end="00:24:06.429" style="s2">and by humanists I mean both other human</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.590" end="00:24:09.460" style="s2">beings and society so you grow up and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.429" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">you watch TV and you see stop signs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.460" end="00:24:12.280" style="s2">you eat fruit</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.440" style="s2">and these are part of your development</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.280" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">and then so that&#39;s that&#39;s the individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.440" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">and then what happens is as you develop</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:22.470" style="s2">you then begin to output you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.420" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">have consequences on nature on reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.470" end="00:24:26.290" style="s2">consequences on other humans and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">consequences on society answers this</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.290" end="00:24:32.500" style="s2">complex set of relationships that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:35.290" style="s2">both sides of qu developing each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.500" end="00:24:37.270" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s culture now then</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.290" end="00:24:39.010" style="s2">technology which of course is a part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.270" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">society and a part of culture human</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.010" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">cultures produce technologies using the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:48.040" style="s2">instruments of society but then</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">technologies change the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.040" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">how we humans relate to nature how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:57.310" style="s2">relate to each other and by the way how</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:59.050" style="s2">we relate to technology which is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.310" end="00:25:00.160" style="s2">last part bit tricking we have to really</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.050" end="00:25:02.830" style="s2">hold on to that this is why we get</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.160" end="00:25:04.630" style="s2">exponential curves okay so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.830" end="00:25:06.220" style="s2">bunch I just unloaded a bunch but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.630" end="00:25:08.500" style="s2">seemed part of one framework so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.220" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">framework here is to say let&#39;s just do</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.500" end="00:25:17.350" style="s2">the blue church for example okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:22.660" style="s2">find ourselves in let&#39;s say 1870s 1880s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.350" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">and we had a set of technologies we had</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.660" end="00:25:29.080" style="s2">the rollout of railroads and we had the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">rise of steam engines and the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.080" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">of electricity and the Telegraph and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:37.870" style="s2">these gave rise these technologies gave</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.409" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">was a problem how do we manage this how</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:04.059" style="s2">problems and take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.539" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">possibilities that arise when we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.059" end="00:27:09.009" style="s2">suddenly move vast resources across</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">continental distances and we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.009" end="00:27:13.299" style="s2">communicate almost instantaneously using</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.320" end="00:27:17.519" style="s2">telegraph but by the way not yet</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.519" end="00:27:23.950" style="s2">when printing presses have now reached</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.490" end="00:27:37.419" style="s2">right the culture is a kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:39.220" style="s2">like like a forest or a species where it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.419" end="00:27:41.470" style="s2">is responding to the context that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.220" end="00:27:42.909" style="s2">finds itself in and has so many</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.470" end="00:27:44.950" style="s2">different ways of you know because</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.909" end="00:27:46.779" style="s2">individual of the basis certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.950" end="00:27:48.370" style="s2">individuals find approaches that work</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.779" end="00:27:49.899" style="s2">and those approaches spread to other</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.370" end="00:27:52.090" style="s2">people who are trying to learn how to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.899" end="00:27:55.000" style="s2">successful as individuals and culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.090" end="00:28:01.389" style="s2">progresses in certain in certain avenues</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.000" end="00:28:04.389" style="s2">and so roundabouts say 1910 1920 at</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.389" end="00:28:06.879" style="s2">least in the United States England maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.389" end="00:28:08.860" style="s2">Western Europe we found ourselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.879" end="00:28:13.539" style="s2">Victorian consensus say a way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:15.909" style="s2">managing life but of course technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.539" end="00:28:19.389" style="s2">didn&#39;t stay still we had moved from</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.909" end="00:28:22.090" style="s2">trains to cars and planes were showing</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.389" end="00:28:24.789" style="s2">up and we had moved from Telegraph&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.090" end="00:28:29.379" style="s2">radio and record players and not too</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.789" end="00:28:30.129" style="s2">long thereafter television and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.379" end="00:28:31.570" style="s2">changes things</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.129" end="00:28:34.619" style="s2">and by the way population changed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.570" end="00:28:34.619" style="s2">where we went from</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.150" end="00:28:39.720" style="s2">50 million people - a hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.620" end="00:28:42.780" style="s2">people and we&#39;ve started blowing towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.720" end="00:28:47.180" style="s2">300 million people which changes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.780" end="00:28:50.520" style="s2">and so as we began to move in into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.180" end="00:28:52.380" style="s2">30s the Victorian consensus began to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.520" end="00:28:57.270" style="s2">break down and so the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.380" end="00:29:00.990" style="s2">emerged throughout the West in the 20s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.270" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">and 30s was largely associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.990" end="00:29:05.850" style="s2">breakdown of a mode of governance that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:09.240" style="s2">was no longer longer adequate to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.850" end="00:29:10.940" style="s2">actual complexity of the real lives</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.240" end="00:29:16.530" style="s2">circumstances that we found ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.940" end="00:29:20.030" style="s2">that a way of operating society that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.530" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">optimized for late 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.030" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">populations using trains and Telegraph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:31.460" style="s2">just wasn&#39;t adequate to a society early</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:35.280" style="s2">20th century society using radio and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.460" end="00:29:38.100" style="s2">automobiles and etc etc and this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.280" end="00:29:39.510" style="s2">crisis and you&#39;re describing is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.100" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">analogous to the one that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.510" end="00:29:44.400" style="s2">out or is it just like miniscule in</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:46.080" style="s2">comparison well let&#39;s start with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.400" end="00:29:47.130" style="s2">being analogous the struggle is start</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:48.510" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.130" end="00:29:49.620" style="s2">and we&#39;ll walk we can actually walk our</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.510" end="00:29:50.670" style="s2">way up and now we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.620" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">interesting - really good space because</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.670" end="00:29:54.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve never considered that question</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:56.040" style="s2">deeply so in a moment we&#39;ll move from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.600" end="00:29:57.030" style="s2">place where I&#39;m telling a story to where</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.040" end="00:29:59.220" style="s2">you and I are actually engaging</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.030" end="00:30:02.100" style="s2">collaboration thanks a lot which is by</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.220" end="00:30:03.810" style="s2">the way the meta story so hold that ok</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.100" end="00:30:06.570" style="s2">so what happens is is we begin to move</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.810" end="00:30:09.480" style="s2">into the post-war environment we begin</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.570" end="00:30:11.910" style="s2">the process of learning how to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.480" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">a new level a new kind a new quality of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.910" end="00:30:17.910" style="s2">governance which is very much using the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:20.340" style="s2">power of broadcast and here television</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.910" end="00:30:22.830" style="s2">is the best example but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.340" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">only if you look at the environment of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.830" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">the post-war environment you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:29.430" style="s2">broadcast is all over the place for me a</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">really good example of school school is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.430" end="00:30:34.920" style="s2">a form of broadcast by that what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:37.080" style="s2">is there&#39;s an asymmetric relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.920" end="00:30:39.240" style="s2">which is to say there&#39;s a teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.080" end="00:30:40.650" style="s2">there&#39;s students and there&#39;s one teacher</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.240" end="00:30:42.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s many students and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.650" end="00:30:43.590" style="s2">teacher does all the talking and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.120" end="00:30:44.760" style="s2">students do all the listening and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.590" end="00:30:45.720" style="s2">teachers in charge of what&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.760" end="00:30:46.730" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong and the students are</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.720" end="00:30:48.809" style="s2">responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.730" end="00:30:49.860" style="s2">figuring out how to give the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.809" end="00:30:51.630" style="s2">with the teacher once all right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.860" end="00:30:53.100" style="s2">that&#39;s an asymmetric relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.630" end="00:30:56.070" style="s2">that&#39;s broadcast broadcast is that sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.100" end="00:30:57.900" style="s2">of thing so you know if I&#39;m if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:30:59.850" style="s2">listening to the radio there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.900" end="00:31:03.720" style="s2">person singing and there may be millions</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.850" end="00:31:04.950" style="s2">of people listening and I can&#39;t I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.720" end="00:31:06.390" style="s2">seem back to the radio but nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.950" end="00:31:08.730" style="s2">can hear me</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.390" end="00:31:12.540" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s television is audio</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.730" end="00:31:14.460" style="s2">and visual it&#39;s almost like reality like</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.540" end="00:31:17.160" style="s2">it simulates our lived experience to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.460" end="00:31:19.490" style="s2">pretty high level and yet in a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.160" end="00:31:21.210" style="s2">modality it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.490" end="00:31:24.030" style="s2">experience but the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.210" end="00:31:26.130" style="s2">Americans in Vietnam was a massive</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.030" end="00:31:28.710" style="s2">psychological shift because we found</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.630" end="00:31:42.540" style="s2">non-trivial extent and that&#39;s as you</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.150" end="00:32:14.220" style="s2">say that it was naive I think the people</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.650" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">were aware of the fact that bias was</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.220" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">there but that there was a feeling of</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.870" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">honest he felt like there was integrity</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.070" end="00:32:36.120" style="s2">culture this is crucial because after</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.500" end="00:32:38.280" style="s2">World War two we came out of a context</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.120" end="00:32:40.770" style="s2">where the depression World War two were</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.280" end="00:32:43.020" style="s2">intense was up and so people</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.770" end="00:32:45.690" style="s2">went back to basics and learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.020" end="00:32:49.620" style="s2">be at least to some meaningful extent</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.690" end="00:32:51.300" style="s2">reliable trustworthy and so television</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.620" end="00:32:54.390" style="s2">kind of grew up in that context and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.300" end="00:32:56.820" style="s2">people who had fought in Iwo Jima were</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.390" end="00:32:59.100" style="s2">able to have a way of relating to each</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.100" end="00:33:02.490" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:04.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a feeling of mutually shared</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.490" end="00:33:07.320" style="s2">responsibility let&#39;s say anyway I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.710" end="00:33:08.940" style="s2">that was a real ray and it&#39;s making me</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.320" end="00:33:10.980" style="s2">think of this word coherence that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.940" end="00:33:12.870" style="s2">think you&#39;ve used plenty and the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.980" end="00:33:15.059" style="s2">that mass communication enabled us</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.870" end="00:33:17.190" style="s2">social coherence do you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.059" end="00:33:19.500" style="s2">coherence was a ground-up phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.190" end="00:33:22.470" style="s2">here in what you just said they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.500" end="00:33:24.270" style="s2">of made me feel like people believe what</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.470" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">was coming across the television screen</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.270" end="00:33:27.690" style="s2">because of the way they felt on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:29.610" style="s2">ground and then sort of they were able</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:31.380" style="s2">to cohere socially because of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.610" end="00:33:33.299" style="s2">rather than the coherence coming down</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.380" end="00:33:34.530" style="s2">from the television screen and into</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.299" end="00:33:36.270" style="s2">their living room and making them feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.530" end="00:33:38.040" style="s2">trusted</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.270" end="00:33:39.720" style="s2">I trust society at that plan it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.040" end="00:33:41.280" style="s2">to be both yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.720" end="00:33:43.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s how it works coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.280" end="00:33:44.940" style="s2">actually a resonance phenomenon from</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.260" end="00:33:47.220" style="s2">both directions so let&#39;s just walk</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.940" end="00:33:49.049" style="s2">through how the blue church worked so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.220" end="00:33:53.040" style="s2">when I say blue church what I mean is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.049" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">a discovery and an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.040" end="00:33:59.520" style="s2">discovery by culture of how to make best</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:03.950" style="s2">use of mostly broadcast modalities to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.520" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">govern and to make choices as a group so</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:07.590" style="s2">one of the characteristics of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.270" style="s2">church was this notion of vertical</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.590" end="00:34:12.060" style="s2">meritocracy so if you&#39;re going to be in</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.270" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">a circumstance where most people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.060" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">going to have to listen and only a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:18.600" style="s2">people are going to be able to speak it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:21.600" style="s2">would be best if the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.600" end="00:34:23.550" style="s2">speaking are really good and so there</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.600" end="00:34:24.840" style="s2">was a I think well-intentioned effort to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.550" end="00:34:27.330" style="s2">find a way to actually deliver on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.840" end="00:34:29.100" style="s2">so that the people who were in charge</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.330" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">were supposed to be meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.100" end="00:34:33.570" style="s2">li.selected you you put the people in</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:34.020" style="s2">charge of NASA who were good at going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.570" end="00:34:36.750" style="s2">the moon</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.020" end="00:34:37.619" style="s2">you didn&#39;t just randomly pick people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.750" end="00:34:40.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t what they&#39;re talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.619" end="00:34:41.909" style="s2">put the people in charge of the FDA who</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.500" end="00:34:43.050" style="s2">were good at figuring out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.909" end="00:34:45.240" style="s2">sure that our food and drugs were</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.050" end="00:34:47.490" style="s2">high-quality I&#39;m still in the blank</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.240" end="00:34:50.100" style="s2">write the whole notion of the period of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.490" end="00:34:53.850" style="s2">say the 1950s through to the night late</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.100" end="00:34:56.250" style="s2">70s was a period of recognizing that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.850" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">fact there&#39;s a lot to that&#39;s right if</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.250" end="00:35:01.830" style="s2">you if you do a good job of identifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:04.440" style="s2">who are the smart kids and elevating</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.830" end="00:35:07.080" style="s2">them into the prestigious universities</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.440" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">and do a good job of educating them well</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.080" end="00:35:12.630" style="s2">and then do a good job of selecting the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:14.220" style="s2">most capable best educated individuals</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.630" end="00:35:16.859" style="s2">to have the most responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.220" end="00:35:18.990" style="s2">you actually get a quite effective and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.859" end="00:35:20.839" style="s2">adaptive governance system that does</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.990" end="00:35:23.480" style="s2">things like takes us to the moon and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.839" end="00:35:27.150" style="s2">builds interstate highway system and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.480" end="00:35:28.770" style="s2">creates the green the second</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.150" end="00:35:30.420" style="s2">agricultural revolution is a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.770" end="00:35:33.530" style="s2">of stuff that happens in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.420" end="00:35:37.470" style="s2">what that machine can do that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.530" end="00:35:39.660" style="s2">governance system and then by the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.470" end="00:35:41.250" style="s2">that was real like that the the the high</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.660" end="00:35:44.250" style="s2">point the high-water mark of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.250" end="00:35:46.170" style="s2">church was in fact actually on the high</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.250" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">watermark of human collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.170" end="00:35:53.400" style="s2">intelligence thus far it did a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:55.410" style="s2">darn good job and of course it also all</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.400" end="00:35:57.720" style="s2">kinds of hairs but let&#39;s ignore those</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.410" end="00:35:59.300" style="s2">for the moment and yeah they kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.720" end="00:36:02.990" style="s2">to where we are we have to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.300" end="00:36:05.010" style="s2">two different kinds of things happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.990" end="00:36:06.329" style="s2">many by the way many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.010" end="00:36:07.619" style="s2">things happen but I&#39;m gonna focus on two</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.329" end="00:36:09.510" style="s2">in terms of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.619" end="00:36:13.500" style="s2">where we are now and the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.510" end="00:36:15.660" style="s2">okay one is once again just like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.500" end="00:36:18.510" style="s2">movement from the Victorian consensus to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.660" end="00:36:21.240" style="s2">the blue church things have changed and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.510" end="00:36:25.619" style="s2">we&#39;ve moved from a broadcast dominant</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.240" end="00:36:27.770" style="s2">form of media to a symmetric interactive</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.619" end="00:36:29.970" style="s2">which is what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.770" end="00:36:33.150" style="s2">the internet is a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.970" end="00:36:36.180" style="s2">thing and it gives rise to a very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.150" end="00:36:38.220" style="s2">different way of entering into</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.180" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">relationship a way of forming collective</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.220" end="00:36:41.130" style="s2">intelligence and then a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:44.460" style="s2">coherence which we&#39;re still in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.130" end="00:36:45.900" style="s2">process of learning we can mention other</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.460" end="00:36:47.930" style="s2">things for example just to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.900" end="00:36:51.930" style="s2">show how these perspectives are nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.930" end="00:36:53.970" style="s2">if you think of television is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.930" end="00:36:56.970" style="s2">extension of with the way the human body</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.970" end="00:37:01.130" style="s2">relates to reality it&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.970" end="00:37:03.270" style="s2">hypertufa keishon of vision and sound</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.130" end="00:37:05.010" style="s2">which is to say it&#39;s like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.270" end="00:37:06.900" style="s2">hallucination television is like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.010" end="00:37:08.910" style="s2">really really effective massive</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.900" end="00:37:11.190" style="s2">hallucination we all have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.910" end="00:37:13.800" style="s2">see I Love Lucy and yet it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.190" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">she&#39;s broadcast to us in a femoral</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.800" end="00:37:18.089" style="s2">medium she&#39;s not really in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:19.650" style="s2">television and so during the television</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.089" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">era not only were we living in a context</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.650" end="00:37:25.140" style="s2">of broadcast we&#39;re also living in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:27.180" style="s2">context of Fantasyland where more and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.140" end="00:37:27.840" style="s2">more and more of our lives or lived in</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.180" end="00:37:33.240" style="s2">the content</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.840" end="00:37:36.120" style="s2">of imagination the Internet has at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.240" end="00:37:38.190" style="s2">one of its characteristics is memory the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.120" end="00:37:40.080" style="s2">internet never forgets their television</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.190" end="00:37:42.390" style="s2">instantaneously forgets think about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.080" end="00:37:43.470" style="s2">television is a flow you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.390" end="00:37:44.610" style="s2">moment you&#39;re in the present what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.470" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">hell just happened I don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.610" end="00:37:48.020" style="s2">actually what&#39;s gonna happen next is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:50.450" style="s2">what matters</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.020" end="00:37:54.030" style="s2">whereas the internet never forgets</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.450" end="00:37:55.980" style="s2">memory is intrinsically necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.030" end="00:37:56.970" style="s2">this new medium and therefore is</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.980" end="00:38:01.800" style="s2">omnipresent</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.970" end="00:38:03.690" style="s2">so symmetric interactive memory is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.800" end="00:38:06.440" style="s2">different technical substrate for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.690" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2">formation of culture and society and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.440" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">well okay obviously it&#39;s going to change</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.180" end="00:38:11.640" style="s2">things and in fact going to change</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.150" style="s2">things a lot because it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.640" end="00:38:16.080" style="s2">different and by the way a lot powerful</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.150" end="00:38:17.250" style="s2">just so we can kind of get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.080" end="00:38:21.660" style="s2">of closure and the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.250" end="00:38:24.570" style="s2">happens is the kind of thing that</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.580" end="00:38:41.400" style="s2">figured out and then they&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.900" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">effective and they&#39;re really effective</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.400" end="00:38:46.910" style="s2">and then they start should not be quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:49.800" style="s2">so effective they break down and so</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:34.590" style="s2">increasingly obvious that the thing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.460" end="00:39:39.660" style="s2">do is to seize control over the</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.740" end="00:39:50.490" style="s2">that&#39;s happening too so yeah I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.930" end="00:39:51.660" style="s2">that you clarified on that because as we</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.490" end="00:39:54.450" style="s2">were talking about the meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.660" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">system I felt like in my mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.450" end="00:39:59.640" style="s2">thinking well this all sounds awfully</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:40:01.589" style="s2">naive in that the powers of our the</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.059" end="00:40:07.140" style="s2">most but this notion of the s-curve and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.549" end="00:40:09.329" style="s2">then being able to game this system</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.140" end="00:40:10.470" style="s2">definitely read that read that resident</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.329" end="00:40:12.119" style="s2">that resident of course because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.470" end="00:40:13.890" style="s2">our lives like we you and I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.119" end="00:40:16.289" style="s2">the context of watching that happen in</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.890" end="00:40:19.650" style="s2">real time so we were born when things</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.289" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">actually still worked ok by the time we</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.650" end="00:40:23.130" style="s2">were young adults it was pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.750" end="00:40:25.650" style="s2">that things weren&#39;t working and of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.130" end="00:40:29.640" style="s2">course all you have to do is just look</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.650" end="00:40:31.770" style="s2">at the wiki leaks emails to see the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.640" end="00:40:34.260" style="s2">inside of how the sausage was made</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.770" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">inside the DNC and say okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.260" end="00:40:40.470" style="s2">late-stage corruption like it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:41.700" style="s2">a there&#39;s like a kind of corruption</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.470" end="00:40:44.190" style="s2">where people are sort of aware the fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.700" end="00:40:45.960" style="s2">that they&#39;re corrupt there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.190" end="00:40:47.730" style="s2">corruption where corruption is so much</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.960" end="00:40:49.049" style="s2">the context the people are just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.730" end="00:40:51.329" style="s2">well this is just how the game is played</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.049" end="00:40:53.309" style="s2">like it&#39;s my corruption right obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.329" end="00:40:54.539" style="s2">you you cheat and it&#39;s not even cheating</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.309" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">it&#39;s just again how the game is played</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.539" end="00:41:00.329" style="s2">so we were able to witness in 2016 in</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:03.240" style="s2">this really interesting real-time in on</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.329" end="00:41:09.289" style="s2">the in the Clinton campaign the late</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.240" end="00:41:12.119" style="s2">stage called fragility and sclerosis and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.289" end="00:41:14.069" style="s2">what it&#39;s called fractal defection by</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.119" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">some of my friends of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.069" end="00:41:19.319" style="s2">and witnessed in the context of what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:21.809" style="s2">call what I call the red religion or the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.319" end="00:41:24.750" style="s2">Trump insurgency the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.809" end="00:41:26.520" style="s2">discovery of this new form this this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.750" end="00:41:29.700" style="s2">thing that is on the basis of what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.520" end="00:41:31.529" style="s2">Internet can do figuring out how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.700" end="00:41:34.349" style="s2">going to play its game all right so both</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.529" end="00:41:36.990" style="s2">were happening simultaneously so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.349" end="00:41:39.270" style="s2">kind of it like if you look at 2007 2016</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.990" end="00:41:42.270" style="s2">my article in 2017 I just said okay well</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.270" end="00:41:45.539" style="s2">here&#39;s a way of thinking about how the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.270" end="00:41:46.920" style="s2">tide is simultaneously going out from</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.539" end="00:41:48.809" style="s2">the blue church and what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.920" end="00:41:52.970" style="s2">and what parts of it are still going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.809" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">have agency like the deep state and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.970" end="00:41:58.910" style="s2">sort of left hand the mass-media and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:42:00.260" style="s2">what parts are the tightest coming in no</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.910" end="00:42:01.730" style="s2">okay there the red religion the trumpet</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.260" end="00:42:03.470" style="s2">insurgency and what happens when these</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.730" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">two forces relate to each other how they</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.470" end="00:42:08.470" style="s2">interact is I proposed a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.680" end="00:42:11.540" style="s2">explanation for what we&#39;re seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.470" end="00:42:13.849" style="s2">now you&#39;re saying like the merit of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.540" end="00:42:15.800" style="s2">meritocracy that was about the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.849" end="00:42:17.869" style="s2">people coming to the forefront to lead</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.800" end="00:42:20.510" style="s2">us in the best way and maybe the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.869" end="00:42:22.910" style="s2">stuff right right and then people learn</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.510" end="00:42:25.339" style="s2">how to game that system and so lesser</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.910" end="00:42:27.950" style="s2">than the idea was then seeking power and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.339" end="00:42:31.400" style="s2">then they come up against people that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.950" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">were born of the internet who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.400" end="00:42:35.780" style="s2">what exactly are they seeking power or</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:38.810" style="s2">are they seeking or are they seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.780" end="00:42:40.099" style="s2">do things the best way well okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.810" end="00:42:43.730" style="s2">a very good question so let&#39;s let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.099" end="00:42:45.800" style="s2">let&#39;s just explore that question so</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.730" end="00:42:46.849" style="s2">first of all the answers gonna be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.800" end="00:42:51.740" style="s2">of different things this is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.849" end="00:42:56.180" style="s2">different people so let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.740" end="00:42:59.990" style="s2">a couple of different aspects one is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.180" end="00:43:02.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of just exploration if</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.990" end="00:43:04.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.650" end="00:43:06.920" style="s2">playing and I don&#39;t mean this</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.579" end="00:43:10.910" style="s2">necessarily like frivolously but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.920" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">exploring new possibilities for how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.910" end="00:43:15.290" style="s2">have a level of agency now I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:17.690" style="s2">power I just mean agency being able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.290" end="00:43:23.630" style="s2">have some sense of ability to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.690" end="00:43:25.130" style="s2">world and a level of sense making in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.630" end="00:43:27.710" style="s2">context where the old sense in making</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.130" end="00:43:29.900" style="s2">frameworks are breaking down so asking</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.710" end="00:43:32.810" style="s2">questions like this right you yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.900" end="00:43:35.000" style="s2">well the the news is clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.810" end="00:43:37.190" style="s2">just not helpful but actively</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.000" end="00:43:38.780" style="s2">destructive what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.190" end="00:43:40.130" style="s2">well let me start asking questions and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.780" end="00:43:41.869" style="s2">mister seeking you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.130" end="00:43:43.310" style="s2">different already blogs I&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.869" end="00:43:44.930" style="s2">Twitter feeds I&#39;ll try to do what I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.310" end="00:43:46.790" style="s2">in a context where it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.930" end="00:43:48.740" style="s2">Cambrian explosion of search because</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.790" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not well understood yes there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of Express going on people</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.849" end="00:43:58.490" style="s2">like to express themselves or net what</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:00.440" style="s2">part of the things that humans do is</p>

<p begin="00:44:11.420" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s because we haven&#39;t yet</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.850" style="s2">newborn infant is a pretty good metaphor</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.280" end="00:44:46.430" style="s2">of avoiding themselves avoiding the pain</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.810" end="00:44:48.950" style="s2">in their lives avoiding taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.430" end="00:44:50.930" style="s2">responsibility for themselves in their</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.950" end="00:44:52.900" style="s2">own context and so a lot of bells other</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.930" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s happening is people</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.900" end="00:44:57.380" style="s2">externalizing their agency and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:44:59.630" style="s2">externalizing their responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.380" end="00:45:02.300" style="s2">using the means of hand which happens to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.630" end="00:45:05.300" style="s2">be asymmetric interactive medium to to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.300" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">do so so instead of sucking their thumb</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.300" end="00:45:13.640" style="s2">and drinking in the the ambrosia of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:16.250" style="s2">television they&#39;re you know screaming at</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.640" end="00:45:18.290" style="s2">each other on Twitter right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.250" end="00:45:20.390" style="s2">when you say externalizing their agency</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.290" end="00:45:23.630" style="s2">you don&#39;t mean in the economic sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.390" end="00:45:25.970" style="s2">like of like putting the ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.630" end="00:45:28.130" style="s2">of their agency outside of their uniform</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:29.540" style="s2">of the universe you mean like you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.130" end="00:45:31.670" style="s2">just putting it outside of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.540" end="00:45:33.050" style="s2">yeah yes putting the outside of</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.670" end="00:45:34.250" style="s2">themselves wherever they put it they put</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.050" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">it but the key is putting it outside of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.250" end="00:45:39.110" style="s2">themselves right Express that&#39;s Express</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">yeah yeah and so that&#39;s you can say like</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.110" end="00:45:42.980" style="s2">people are working through their</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:44.270" style="s2">now increasingly in public as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.980" end="00:45:46.580" style="s2">working through their with a bottle</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.270" end="00:45:49.840" style="s2">of you know or six-pack of beer and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.580" end="00:45:52.310" style="s2">watching the NFL on on Monday night</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.840" end="00:45:53.570" style="s2">complaining at dinner what shows up</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.310" end="00:45:56.930" style="s2">differently right it&#39;s just a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.570" end="00:45:59.510" style="s2">way of that happening in again in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.930" end="00:46:01.820" style="s2">context where there&#39;s a breaking free a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.510" end="00:46:04.460" style="s2">breaking loose like the old structures</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.820" end="00:46:06.410" style="s2">are simultaneously not working and our</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.460" end="00:46:08.060" style="s2">best obviously coercive so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.410" end="00:46:10.010" style="s2">whole bunch of people are saying hey I</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.060" end="00:46:11.240" style="s2">can do stuff maybe I can do something</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.010" end="00:46:14.420" style="s2">here there&#39;s an opportunity for me to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.240" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">expand my local fitness my individual</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.420" end="00:46:19.559" style="s2">capacity to proliferate</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:21.059" style="s2">successful and healthy and powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.559" end="00:46:22.499" style="s2">sexy or whatever or whatever particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.059" end="00:46:24.450" style="s2">values are expressing themselves through</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.499" end="00:46:27.469" style="s2">this individual because the context is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.450" end="00:46:30.209" style="s2">shifting it&#39;s a it&#39;s a gold rush it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.469" end="00:46:34.619" style="s2">Renaissance those things are Cambrian</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.209" end="00:46:36.599" style="s2">explosion possibility hmm the gold rush</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.619" end="00:46:38.459" style="s2">continues still right this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.599" end="00:46:40.349" style="s2">still the Wild West right no none of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.459" end="00:46:42.180" style="s2">this is settled or or is it settled are</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.349" end="00:46:44.430" style="s2">we still all just exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.180" end="00:46:47.519" style="s2">expressing and trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.430" end="00:46:50.430" style="s2">the endgame is for this new technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.519" end="00:46:52.650" style="s2">slash culture interfaces from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.430" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">internet or are we in the endgame are we</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.650" end="00:46:56.609" style="s2">in the mid-game is this still are we</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:47:00.769" style="s2">still infants well now we get into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.609" end="00:47:00.769" style="s2">the part that gets actually tricky</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.099" end="00:47:04.969" style="s2">because one of the things that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.329" end="00:47:08.549" style="s2">be the case is that we&#39;re on an</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.969" end="00:47:11.489" style="s2">accelerating curve so it&#39;s one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.549" end="00:47:13.289" style="s2">be in a context of change and so we work</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.489" end="00:47:17.959" style="s2">things have changed from the 1950s to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.289" end="00:47:22.680" style="s2">the 9 2010 to 2020 20s but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.959" end="00:47:23.940" style="s2">change it&#39;s accelerating change Wow well</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.680" end="00:47:25.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.940" end="00:47:28.349" style="s2">because we know we&#39;re now not having to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.319" end="00:47:30.630" style="s2">adapt to a new context we have to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.349" end="00:47:35.759" style="s2">to the fact that our need to adapt is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.630" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">itself changing meta adaptation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.759" end="00:47:41.880" style="s2">where gets incredibly well actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:44.729" style="s2">interesting to be perfectly honest</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.880" end="00:47:45.959" style="s2">so the oddities are terrifying and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.729" end="00:47:50.130" style="s2">less terrified a lot of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.959" end="00:47:51.150" style="s2">actually start to become whether they go</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.130" end="00:47:53.640" style="s2">through a really interesting thing where</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.150" end="00:47:54.959" style="s2">they become meaningless and then they go</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.640" end="00:47:57.269" style="s2">to a higher level when they become</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.959" end="00:48:00.599" style="s2">meaningful again so we are at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.269" end="00:48:02.369" style="s2">the beginning but in a context where the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.599" end="00:48:05.190" style="s2">beginning is itself beginning again and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.369" end="00:48:08.519" style="s2">new constantly so lots of things have</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.190" end="00:48:09.799" style="s2">been settled but in the process of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.519" end="00:48:13.949" style="s2">being settled they&#39;ve actually changed</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.799" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">the context of the world such that a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.949" end="00:48:19.769" style="s2">whole new set of things are now</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:20.999" style="s2">unsettled this is a real thing so let me</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.769" end="00:48:23.549" style="s2">see if I can put this in an in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.999" end="00:48:26.310" style="s2">language it makes it a little bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.549" end="00:48:30.060" style="s2">to handle a little bit easier to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.310" end="00:48:32.760" style="s2">so in evolutionary theory we have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.060" end="00:48:35.310" style="s2">Conn the concept of a niche so say like</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.760" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">the jungle let&#39;s pick a particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.310" end="00:48:42.470" style="s2">jungle it&#39;s beyond the Amazon rainforest</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:44.760" style="s2">and in the context of a niche we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.470" end="00:48:47.010" style="s2">Fitness the degree which a particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.760" end="00:48:49.050" style="s2">style of being an animal or a plant is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.010" end="00:48:50.790" style="s2">good choice so being a white furry</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.050" end="00:48:52.980" style="s2">arctic style bunny and the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.790" end="00:48:55.140" style="s2">rainforest is bad and so they go away</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.980" end="00:48:56.700" style="s2">and being a Jaguar is awesome so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.140" end="00:48:57.690" style="s2">Jaguars right so that&#39;s the idea you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.700" end="00:49:00.870" style="s2">got it you got a niche</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.690" end="00:49:03.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a level of fitness and then as</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.870" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">time goes forward the organisms in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.150" end="00:49:08.280" style="s2">niche find out where there are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:11.550" style="s2">relative Fitness&#39;s and it settles into</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.280" end="00:49:13.020" style="s2">what the ecosystem happens to be and of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.550" end="00:49:14.850" style="s2">course the ecosystem creates is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.020" end="00:49:18.680" style="s2">co-created meaning that the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.850" end="00:49:20.940" style="s2">Jaguars is part of the niche for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.680" end="00:49:22.110" style="s2">capybaras and the presence of captain</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.940" end="00:49:23.370" style="s2">berries is sort of a niche for Jaguars</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.110" end="00:49:27.960" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not you have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.370" end="00:49:30.300" style="s2">mindful of that now there&#39;s a concept</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.960" end="00:49:32.310" style="s2">called niche construction so like say</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.300" end="00:49:35.790" style="s2">Bevers Bevers don&#39;t just sort of sit</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.310" end="00:49:39.000" style="s2">idly by they build dams they change the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.790" end="00:49:40.410" style="s2">niche with some effectiveness they they</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.000" end="00:49:46.220" style="s2">make the environment that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.410" end="00:49:50.010" style="s2">more conducive to being a beaver well</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.220" end="00:49:52.220" style="s2">the notion of niche construction if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.010" end="00:49:55.770" style="s2">think about that mean so that means is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.220" end="00:50:06.060" style="s2">an organism that has the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.770" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">change the niche in some way so as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.060" end="00:50:12.120" style="s2">capacity for niche construction</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:17.190" style="s2">increases you find yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.120" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">situation where the changing of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.190" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">niche changes the fitness requirements</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:29.580" style="s2">and if you&#39;re say I don&#39;t know a fish</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:31.500" style="s2">it&#39;s in a niche that has beavers you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.580" end="00:50:34.200" style="s2">have to be able to respond not just to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.500" end="00:50:38.850" style="s2">the way that the niche changes from kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.200" end="00:50:39.880" style="s2">of slower old-fashioned meteorological</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.850" end="00:50:42.220" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.880" end="00:50:43.509" style="s2">the river kind of stuff you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.220" end="00:50:44.890" style="s2">actually start being responsive to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.509" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">kinds of changes that happen when a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.890" end="00:50:51.339" style="s2">biological organism in biological</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:56.500" style="s2">organism time can change the nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.339" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">a lot faster this gives rise to for</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.500" end="00:51:01.000" style="s2">example the need for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:04.500" style="s2">intelligence is the ability to change</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.000" end="00:51:06.789" style="s2">the way you&#39;re responding to your niche</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.500" end="00:51:11.259" style="s2">behaviorally instead of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.789" end="00:51:14.170" style="s2">genetically you change it real time real</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.259" end="00:51:15.930" style="s2">time versus over time real time over say</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.170" end="00:51:17.769" style="s2">well I call it evolutionary time or</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.930" end="00:51:20.859" style="s2">biological time and of course before</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.769" end="00:51:22.059" style="s2">that you had geological time and so of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.859" end="00:51:23.349" style="s2">course now we start to get an</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.059" end="00:51:24.849" style="s2">interesting story because if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.349" end="00:51:26.829" style="s2">the story of Homo sapiens the story of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.849" end="00:51:29.259" style="s2">Homo sapiens is that story it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.829" end="00:51:31.240" style="s2">story of becoming more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.259" end="00:51:33.579" style="s2">responding to changes in the niche and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.240" end="00:51:35.289" style="s2">therefore also becoming more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.579" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">niche construction and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.289" end="00:51:39.009" style="s2">changing the niche and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:41.230" style="s2">requiring more capability of chain and</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.009" end="00:51:42.339" style="s2">respondent changes in niche but also</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.230" end="00:51:45.630" style="s2">therefore becoming more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.339" end="00:51:48.819" style="s2">changing the niche accelerating change</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.630" end="00:51:52.299" style="s2">so you might say the humanity mo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.819" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">is the experiment of what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.299" end="00:51:57.549" style="s2">niche construction meets intelligence in</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">an accelerating rate now I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.549" end="00:52:03.009" style="s2">that made it any easier for words right</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:04.690" style="s2">I mean I mean it makes sense to me I</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.009" end="00:52:06.490" style="s2">mean we influence our environment and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.690" end="00:52:08.349" style="s2">then the environment influences us and</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.490" end="00:52:10.660" style="s2">then it is a feedback cycle and but</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.349" end="00:52:12.099" style="s2">we&#39;re really good at trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.660" end="00:52:13.960" style="s2">out how to respond to that fact and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.099" end="00:52:15.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the key right we&#39;re we&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.960" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">special kind of animal that is that kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.880" end="00:52:21.369" style="s2">of animal well that&#39;s we&#39;ve created the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:23.079" style="s2">niche that favors our inherent ability</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.369" end="00:52:24.460" style="s2">to Anish create I mean that sounds sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.079" end="00:52:26.200" style="s2">of redundant thing to say but I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.460" end="00:52:28.180" style="s2">that that sort of sums up for we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.200" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">talking about well if that if you said</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.180" end="00:52:31.450" style="s2">it well so that means to me that we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:34.660" style="s2">actually speaking about the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.450" end="00:52:36.369" style="s2">that&#39;s great huge advantage this of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.660" end="00:52:38.200" style="s2">symmetric you know communicative medium</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.369" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">so so then what happens is we say okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.200" end="00:52:44.200" style="s2">cool well what might be the right kinds</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:48.460" style="s2">of ways to respond to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.200" end="00:52:49.779" style="s2">reality mmm-hmm and what kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.460" end="00:52:51.250" style="s2">being in the world what kind of what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.779" end="00:52:52.900" style="s2">call a collective intelligence if we</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.250" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">think about the blue church is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.900" end="00:52:56.340" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">what kind of collective intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.340" end="00:53:02.370" style="s2">in fact intrinsically most fit in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:04.940" style="s2">context of this feedback loop between</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.370" end="00:53:08.010" style="s2">intelligence and niche construction well</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:10.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question mm-hm and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.010" end="00:53:12.780" style="s2">I think that is where we are mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.500" end="00:53:13.980" style="s2">anybody who gets that as a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.780" end="00:53:15.390" style="s2">question that could really settle on</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.980" end="00:53:18.300" style="s2">that and go hmm Wow</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.390" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">I better think about that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.300" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">actually looking in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:26.760" style="s2">and so what what is the niche that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:28.920" style="s2">operating in where it&#39;s feedbacking on</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.760" end="00:53:30.630" style="s2">to us and we&#39;re sort of immersed in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.920" end="00:53:32.250" style="s2">this dance that&#39;s spiraling out of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.630" end="00:53:33.750" style="s2">control where where is that niche</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.250" end="00:53:36.780" style="s2">actually play out in our day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.750" end="00:53:40.890" style="s2">lives well everywhere it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.780" end="00:53:42.780" style="s2">relationship between society culture and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.890" end="00:53:45.090" style="s2">technology so I&#39;ll give you a great</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.780" end="00:53:47.370" style="s2">concrete example there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.090" end="00:53:49.980" style="s2">article written by a woman writing for I</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.370" end="00:53:53.250" style="s2">think it blog called ribbons bomb and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.980" end="00:53:55.620" style="s2">she is making the argument that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.250" end="00:53:58.260" style="s2">various entities that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.620" end="00:54:01.560" style="s2">figure out how to respond to cyber war</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.260" end="00:54:03.480" style="s2">are not doing a good job and she uses</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.560" end="00:54:05.060" style="s2">the Maginot Line metaphor which I of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.480" end="00:54:07.170" style="s2">course have used myself many times</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.060" end="00:54:08.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not fair with military well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.170" end="00:54:10.020" style="s2">going to assume that your listeners are</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.700" end="00:54:11.430" style="s2">either familiar with military history</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.020" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">enough to get the metaphor or familiar</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.430" end="00:54:16.410" style="s2">with Wikipedia enough to look it up but</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:18.420" style="s2">the basic idea is you can fight the last</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.410" end="00:54:20.040" style="s2">war and people often do might like</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.420" end="00:54:22.020" style="s2">World War 1 suck but what do we do let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.040" end="00:54:23.820" style="s2">build judge is rule is about trench</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.020" end="00:54:25.860" style="s2">warfare oh I know oh we&#39;ll build a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.820" end="00:54:28.380" style="s2">really awesome trench and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.860" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">that&#39;ll be awesome oh the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.380" end="00:54:31.110" style="s2">figured out that trenches aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.430" end="00:54:32.930" style="s2">thing anymore now it&#39;s blitzkrieg in</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.110" end="00:54:35.580" style="s2">blitzkrieg totally rock-paper-scissors</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.930" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">the trench and France loses in a couple</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.580" end="00:54:38.580" style="s2">of weeks right so that&#39;s the idea if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:39.510" style="s2">fight the last war then you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.580" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">setting yourself up to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.510" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">surprised when the next war happens to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:44.460" style="s2">be at your door right further</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:45.990" style="s2">proposition is hey cyberwarriors you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.620" end="00:56:15.540" style="s2">sexually been live for real yeah alright</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.560" end="00:56:17.220" style="s2">so so here&#39;s where she gets it wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.540" end="00:56:20.010" style="s2">where we can actually start to move it</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.220" end="00:56:22.950" style="s2">in the direction of getting it right she</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.010" end="00:56:25.670" style="s2">then goes on to say okay so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.950" end="00:56:29.010" style="s2">like the old war here&#39;s the new war and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.670" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">okay FBI and CIA and NSA and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.010" end="00:56:31.740" style="s2">and Google get your together like</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:36.560" style="s2">start figuring how to fight the new war</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.740" end="00:56:39.810" style="s2">and my response is those are the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.560" end="00:56:42.000" style="s2">kinds of tools those are instruments the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.810" end="00:56:45.780" style="s2">NSA the FBI Google Facebook that were</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.780" end="00:56:50.820" style="s2">kind of collective intelligence they</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.790" end="00:56:53.880" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense fast enough they can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.850" end="00:57:08.700" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a war anymore about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.300" end="00:57:12.330" style="s2">force to bear this is a war about</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.330" end="00:57:16.800" style="s2">actually move faster it&#39;s called a</p>

<p begin="00:57:48.600" end="00:57:53.130" style="s2">kind of plug John Boyd into John Boyd</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.730" end="00:57:54.960" style="s2">and then you just keep doing that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.130" end="00:57:57.060" style="s2">like to do a recursive loop on it you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:58.710" style="s2">get to an end point and if you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.060" end="00:58:00.450" style="s2">perceive what I just said and hold it</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.510" end="00:58:14.490" style="s2">not a trivial thing the notion of what</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.290" end="00:58:25.740" style="s2">is the mind all right so I have to now</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.660" end="00:58:27.750" style="s2">step back here&#39;s here&#39;s where we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:58:28.890" end="00:58:35.130" style="s2">of the story as far as we can go if you</p>

<p begin="00:58:35.130" end="00:58:41.760" style="s2">almost certainly grew up in the context</p>

<p begin="00:58:49.950" end="00:58:53.130" style="s2">nonetheless most agree developmental</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.510" end="00:58:54.870" style="s2">environment was still in the context of</p>

<p begin="00:59:16.940" end="00:59:24.180" style="s2">well unfortunately that mind is itself</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.000" end="00:59:27.480" style="s2">not responsive it is not adaptive to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.180" end="00:59:29.930" style="s2">emergent context this is not a simple</p>

<p begin="00:59:43.940" end="00:59:46.730" style="s2">centerpiece of the whole thing so this</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.050" end="00:59:48.950" style="s2">is where by the way I am so we are now</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.730" end="00:59:51.410" style="s2">kind of all caught up with me</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.950" end="00:59:55.369" style="s2">my personal Ark is the awareness of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.410" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">problem and then the endeavor to try to</p>

<p begin="01:00:17.569" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">blank you don&#39;t think that the human</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.300" end="01:00:24.260" style="s2">mind is adaptive enough to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:27.980" style="s2">overcome that problem on its own did I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.260" end="01:00:30.950" style="s2">do okay I do but the the late 20th</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.980" end="01:00:34.040" style="s2">century Western civilization blue church</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.950" end="01:00:36.829" style="s2">mind is not right now that&#39;s a mind that</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.040" end="01:00:38.510" style="s2">we were handed but can we discard it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.829" end="01:00:40.940" style="s2">find a new one now I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.510" end="01:00:43.220" style="s2">personally I mean I&#39;m able to operate in</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.940" end="01:00:45.950" style="s2">this on these margins here that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.220" end="01:00:48.530" style="s2">talking about and sometimes I attribute</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.950" end="01:00:51.890" style="s2">it to being Gen X and also like a real</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.530" end="01:00:53.660" style="s2">early tech adopter as Gen X so I I</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.890" end="01:00:55.339" style="s2">remember being analog and I remember</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.660" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">being digital and I remember sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.339" end="01:00:59.780" style="s2">evolved into the yeah I remember</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.780" end="01:01:04.099" style="s2">time and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.210" end="01:01:05.930" style="s2">gives me a special leg up and understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.099" end="01:01:08.809" style="s2">I think helps a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.930" end="01:01:10.970" style="s2">dandy yeah the notion that when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.809" end="01:01:14.210" style="s2">kid your mind was actually taught</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.970" end="01:01:18.230" style="s2">firsthand that reality can be simulated</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.210" end="01:01:20.030" style="s2">and draining your reality simulator to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.230" end="01:01:21.829" style="s2">not mistake reality for reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.030" end="01:01:25.400" style="s2">simulation is actually a really useful</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.829" end="01:01:26.869" style="s2">lucky thing to have run into that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.400" end="01:01:28.069" style="s2">funny my favorite part of Dungeons &amp;</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.869" end="01:01:29.809" style="s2">Dragons was actually just flipping</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.069" end="01:01:32.690" style="s2">through the monster manuals and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.809" end="01:01:34.280" style="s2">just fabricating characters yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.690" end="01:01:36.230" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to have to play all those</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.280" end="01:01:38.619" style="s2">damn games I just wrote down I was level</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.230" end="01:01:40.660" style="s2">99 man and I was this and I had that</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.619" end="01:01:42.819" style="s2">fancy well think about this in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.660" end="01:01:44.109" style="s2">context of this notion of NPC it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.819" end="01:01:47.019" style="s2">that we actually have we had the error</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.109" end="01:01:48.819" style="s2">concept well if you&#39;re a human being</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.019" end="01:01:50.109" style="s2">like a real live human being and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.819" end="01:01:51.690" style="s2">not aware of the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.109" end="01:01:53.739" style="s2">playing a character most of the time</p>

<p begin="01:01:53.739" end="01:01:56.769" style="s2">identity was something you fabricated</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:58.719" style="s2">sometime during adolescence to allow you</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.769" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">to fit in and be successful in your</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.719" end="01:02:05.259" style="s2">social milieu then you&#39;re an NPC that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:07.479" style="s2">what an NPC really is if you are aware</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.259" end="01:02:10.269" style="s2">of that fact and you can kind of hold</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.479" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">bad identity somewhat loosely and step</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.269" end="01:02:16.749" style="s2">back or step down or up depending your</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.119" end="01:02:18.460" style="s2">preferred directionality and drop into</p>

<p begin="01:02:18.460" end="01:02:23.529" style="s2">what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll play a female elf</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.529" end="01:02:26.920" style="s2">you can recognize it that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.609" end="01:02:29.289" style="s2">you can actually do that then what you</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.920" end="01:02:31.979" style="s2">can do is you can try to step into the</p>

<p begin="01:02:40.839" end="01:02:47.589" style="s2">is the place from which that is coming</p>

<p begin="01:04:36.650" end="01:04:40.370" style="s2">disruption of the 60s and 70s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.020" end="01:04:46.010" style="s2">threw a monkey wrench into those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.370" end="01:04:50.060" style="s2">of things but things like no keeping</p>

<p begin="01:05:38.870" end="01:05:45.890" style="s2">pretend like we&#39;re you know Stone Age</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.630" end="01:05:47.870" style="s2">tribesmen because that ain&#39;t real either</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.890" end="01:05:49.460" style="s2">that just that&#39;s the the worst case you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.870" end="01:05:52.670" style="s2">know that&#39;s late 20th century mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.460" end="01:05:54.890" style="s2">simulating something but if we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.670" end="01:05:56.630" style="s2">actually sort of listen to the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.890" end="01:06:00.320" style="s2">that has actually been really handed</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.630" end="01:06:01.880" style="s2">down painfully and carefully because it</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.320" end="01:06:05.570" style="s2">is the most precious and most meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.880" end="01:06:08.920" style="s2">and allow that kind of thing be the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.570" end="01:06:12.200" style="s2">basis of how we go about making our next</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.920" end="01:06:17.450" style="s2">choices and very carefully do so right</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.200" end="01:06:19.460" style="s2">recognizing that we are we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.450" end="01:06:21.770" style="s2">getting across that we&#39;re in a journey</p>

<p begin="01:06:21.770" end="01:06:26.510" style="s2">to use some good old-fashioned method</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:28.970" style="s2">poetic language so we have to take each</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.510" end="01:06:30.950" style="s2">step carefully we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.970" end="01:06:32.570" style="s2">where we are but we do know that we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.950" end="01:06:35.630" style="s2">to take each step carefully so let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.570" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">that and we can rely to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.630" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">we can rely on stuff that is the oldest</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:48.530" style="s2">and most shared because well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:50.420" style="s2">best we have and it&#39;s actually pretty</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.530" end="01:06:52.070" style="s2">darn good to be perfectly honest we just</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.420" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">have to be thoughtful be careful and be</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.070" end="01:06:59.810" style="s2">thoughtful mm-hmm I wanted to finished</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:02.570" style="s2">on that one you can see your eyes still</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.810" end="01:07:04.970" style="s2">going I feel like I&#39;m finished on that</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.570" end="01:07:06.680" style="s2">one okay I wanted to I wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.970" end="01:07:10.099" style="s2">into this conversation this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.680" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">sovereignty that I read of yours and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.099" end="01:07:13.400" style="s2">there&#39;s three and there was three</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.950" style="s2">elements to it if you could lay them out</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.400" end="01:07:17.329" style="s2">because my audience is predominantly</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.950" end="01:07:19.310" style="s2">male there&#39;s a lot of women but</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.329" end="01:07:23.150" style="s2">predominantly male and most of them are</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.310" end="01:07:26.329" style="s2">24 to 44 and most of them feel as though</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.150" end="01:07:27.710" style="s2">they lack personal sovereignty and most</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.329" end="01:07:29.810" style="s2">of them feel as though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.710" end="01:07:31.339" style="s2">struggling against the society that</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.810" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">wants to strip their sovereignty from</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.339" end="01:07:36.770" style="s2">them and also feels as though that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.640" end="01:07:39.410" style="s2">they&#39;re in a circumstance in which</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.770" end="01:07:41.450" style="s2">they&#39;re detached from these ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.410" end="01:07:43.970" style="s2">year old traditional ideas that actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.450" end="01:07:46.730" style="s2">work and they&#39;re floating in a sea of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.970" end="01:07:48.800" style="s2">this sort of confusion where they feel</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.730" end="01:07:51.170" style="s2">sort of violated on a daily basis and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.800" end="01:07:53.060" style="s2">your your notions of sovereignty I</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.170" end="01:07:54.920" style="s2">thought really were powerful and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.060" end="01:07:56.660" style="s2">want to when you have to explain them</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.920" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna punctuate that relative to my</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.660" end="01:08:00.050" style="s2">audience so I thought it was great so if</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:03.230" style="s2">you could please explain that we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.050" end="01:08:04.490" style="s2">wrap up after that okay so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.230" end="01:08:10.940" style="s2">referred to the three things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.490" end="01:08:14.089" style="s2">referring to perception it&#39;s making a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.940" end="01:08:15.319" style="s2">choice making yeah okay all right so</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.089" end="01:08:16.850" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m gonna do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.319" end="01:08:19.040" style="s2">one and then I want to do three other</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.850" end="01:08:21.529" style="s2">that are are oblique like they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.040" end="01:08:23.270" style="s2">they cross like this and that that gives</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.529" end="01:08:27.319" style="s2">you actually a the ability to have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.270" end="01:08:28.569" style="s2">nice sphere so this three goes this way</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.319" end="01:08:31.099" style="s2">the other three goes this way I</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.569" end="01:08:32.989" style="s2">apologize</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.099" end="01:08:34.940" style="s2">said seems absolutely absurd remember I</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.989" end="01:08:38.029" style="s2">coveted the beginning that I&#39;m just an</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.940" end="01:08:39.560" style="s2">unusual kind of dude plus plus Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.029" end="01:08:42.290" style="s2">and I can see each other on video but</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.560" end="01:08:44.420" style="s2">we&#39;re not recording it so Oh even better</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.290" end="01:08:49.429" style="s2">yeah so an audio it sounds like a circle</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.420" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not a one okay so to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.429" end="01:08:52.849" style="s2">sovereignty we have just this very</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:54.170" style="s2">simple notion that we were kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.849" end="01:08:56.480" style="s2">discussing the very beginning you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.170" end="01:08:59.270" style="s2">perception we have sense making and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.480" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">we have a choice making so in perception</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.270" end="01:09:04.730" style="s2">we have the capacity to perceive what is</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:06.829" style="s2">happening to us in the world and we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.730" end="01:09:08.839" style="s2">notice that there&#39;s this can be very</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.829" end="01:09:10.849" style="s2">little and it can be a lot you know so</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.839" end="01:09:12.710" style="s2">does a simple experiment or is so your</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.849" end="01:09:13.310" style="s2">perception just became less and you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.710" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">open your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.310" end="01:09:19.400" style="s2">your perception became more and if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.920" end="01:09:22.670" style="s2">say for example have learned how to I</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.400" end="01:09:25.279" style="s2">don&#39;t know surf or to play baseball or</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.670" end="01:09:27.139" style="s2">basketball or walk in the woods you will</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.279" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">notice that as you have learned how to</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.139" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">be in these environments what you see</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:34.099" style="s2">changes you can see more alright so</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.960" end="01:09:35.980" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea of perception that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.099" end="01:09:39.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of practice involved in</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.980" end="01:09:41.659" style="s2">expanding your perception and in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.079" end="01:09:43.250" style="s2">context of sovereignty a big piece of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.659" end="01:09:44.480" style="s2">is actually being able to expand your</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.250" end="01:09:48.020" style="s2">perception in what I&#39;m going to call</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.480" end="01:09:52.190" style="s2">symmetry and what that means is that for</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.020" end="01:09:55.400" style="s2">example having too much vision and not</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.190" end="01:09:57.110" style="s2">enough sound or hearing creates a bias</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.400" end="01:09:58.760" style="s2">that creates a kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.110" end="01:10:01.639" style="s2">saber-toothed tiger or a zebra trees</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.760" end="01:10:03.500" style="s2">tiger is something that is leaning too</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.639" end="01:10:06.920" style="s2">heavy in the direction of long teeth and</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s very fragile to changes where as</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.920" end="01:10:11.780" style="s2">a human you&#39;re Homo sapiens is actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:13.099" style="s2">kind of well poised and balanced and can</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.780" end="01:10:15.320" style="s2">kind of go in different directions and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.099" end="01:10:16.790" style="s2">big metaphor in sovereignty is that well</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.320" end="01:10:18.260" style="s2">for your audience it&#39;s the middle</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.790" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">linebacker right the ball is snapped</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.260" end="01:10:22.340" style="s2">just drop your hips chop your knees put</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:24.349" style="s2">your head on a swivel so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.340" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">respond to what&#39;s happening and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.349" end="01:10:28.550" style="s2">basic sense of symmetry this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:30.199" style="s2">balance is crucial across all these</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.550" end="01:10:32.690" style="s2">dimensions so in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.199" end="01:10:34.610" style="s2">perception it means things like really</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.690" end="01:10:36.260" style="s2">being able to unlock all these wide</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.610" end="01:10:39.260" style="s2">varieties of perception that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.260" end="01:10:41.270" style="s2">available learning how to listen to your</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.260" end="01:10:43.250" style="s2">entire emotional manifold and allow</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.270" end="01:10:45.140" style="s2">anger to arise and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.250" end="01:10:46.040" style="s2">notice what your anger is actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.140" end="01:10:47.630" style="s2">telling you because it&#39;s telling you</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.040" end="01:10:49.430" style="s2">something it&#39;s telling you something</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.630" end="01:10:51.020" style="s2">that some part of you feels like you</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.430" end="01:10:55.100" style="s2">need to fight that&#39;s what it is right</p>

<p begin="01:12:55.379" end="01:13:00.959" style="s2">so here&#39;s where practices like</p>

<p begin="01:13:17.010" end="01:13:23.579" style="s2">bringing toolkits to bear second so then</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.079" end="01:13:27.059" style="s2">you have choice making which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.579" end="01:13:29.609" style="s2">combining both selecting that set of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.059" end="01:13:32.459" style="s2">actions that seem to make the most sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.609" end="01:13:35.070" style="s2">from those actions that you are in fact</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.459" end="01:13:37.649" style="s2">most skillful of engaging in so here I</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.070" end="01:13:40.079" style="s2">mean in choice I mean both the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.649" end="01:13:42.689" style="s2">the conscious notion of choosing but</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.079" end="01:13:44.609" style="s2">also the embodiment of doing so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.689" end="01:13:48.109" style="s2">both choice making is is is an embodied</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.609" end="01:13:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a thing in the world so I have</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.109" end="01:13:52.829" style="s2">chose right when I chose to be on this</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.119" end="01:13:55.019" style="s2">podcast it wasn&#39;t just something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.829" end="01:13:57.179" style="s2">happening in my mind it was already</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.019" end="01:13:58.979" style="s2">showing up as a determination that I</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.179" end="01:14:02.939" style="s2">would secure the time and space to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.979" end="01:14:04.919" style="s2">present here not elsewhere so when I say</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.939" end="01:14:08.249" style="s2">choice I mean choice and commitment are</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.919" end="01:14:12.179" style="s2">the same word Millennials I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.249" end="01:14:14.699" style="s2">you we extras really refer you think of</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.179" end="01:14:19.379" style="s2">you guys as being flaky because for some</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.699" end="01:14:22.159" style="s2">reason you have this weird habit of not</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.379" end="01:14:27.629" style="s2">doing what you say you&#39;re gonna do I</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.159" end="01:14:29.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know why but you do so choice then</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.629" end="01:14:32.369" style="s2">is this very interesting dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.070" end="01:14:33.539" style="s2">between the dispositional potential of</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.369" end="01:14:36.959" style="s2">what you could do in the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.539" end="01:14:39.059" style="s2">your skillfulness in the world and your</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.959" end="01:14:41.039" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s happening all right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.059" end="01:14:44.010" style="s2">so to make a good choice to make the</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.039" end="01:14:45.199" style="s2">most effective choice is the last part</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.010" end="01:14:49.039" style="s2">of sovereignty and this of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.199" end="01:14:53.579" style="s2">involves the discipline of again</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.039" end="01:14:55.619" style="s2">allowing your liminal mind to come into</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.579" end="01:14:57.139" style="s2">fluidly so the phrase slow is smooth</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.619" end="01:15:01.739" style="s2">smooth is fast</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.139" end="01:15:04.450" style="s2">like allowing the time necessary for the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.739" end="01:15:08.580" style="s2">right choice to actually emerge</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.450" end="01:15:11.340" style="s2">and then taking the care to build</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.580" end="01:15:14.470" style="s2">skillfulness so that you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.340" end="01:15:16.240" style="s2">deliver on that choice all the way</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.470" end="01:15:20.170" style="s2">through to the end with the least amount</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.240" end="01:15:22.510" style="s2">of unintended consequences and with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.170" end="01:15:24.130" style="s2">least amount of effort it should be</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.510" end="01:15:27.730" style="s2">effortless you can think about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.130" end="01:15:30.430" style="s2">difference between say a let&#39;s try Bruce</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.730" end="01:15:31.960" style="s2">Lee is a good example if you watch Bruce</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.430" end="01:15:36.190" style="s2">Lee he brings an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.960" end="01:15:38.200" style="s2">force with no excess motion so become</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.190" end="01:15:40.180" style="s2">Bruce Lee is the last and he is</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.200" end="01:15:41.770" style="s2">sovereign in the context of at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.180" end="01:15:45.160" style="s2">come true and actually he was sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.770" end="01:15:47.830" style="s2">in a lot of contexts so then we can say</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.160" end="01:15:49.630" style="s2">is alright you did seem three pieces all</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.830" end="01:15:51.130" style="s2">now are connected to each other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.630" end="01:15:52.270" style="s2">they&#39;re all proper the same thing and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.130" end="01:15:54.010" style="s2">you have to be very thoughtful about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.270" end="01:15:55.720" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s the whole as integrated</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.010" end="01:15:56.860" style="s2">with each other if you over bias in any</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.720" end="01:15:58.420" style="s2">one of these three directions you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.860" end="01:16:00.120" style="s2">once again becoming a sympathies tiger</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.420" end="01:16:02.260" style="s2">you have to be able to actually step up</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.120" end="01:16:05.440" style="s2">and then we can be aware of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.260" end="01:16:06.790" style="s2">that all of these are contextual so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.440" end="01:16:10.150" style="s2">mentioned for example that Bruce Lee was</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.790" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">sovereign in the context of kung-fu he</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.150" end="01:16:14.590" style="s2">probably wasn&#39;t sovereign in the context</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2">of surfing but I imagine it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.590" end="01:16:18.720" style="s2">have taken him too long - you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.480" end="01:16:22.630" style="s2">aware now of meta aware of where you are</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.720" end="01:16:23.950" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of where you&#39;re showing or how</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.630" end="01:16:27.040" style="s2">you&#39;re showing up so I might for example</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.950" end="01:16:31.150" style="s2">be sovereign I&#39;m walking down the street</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.040" end="01:16:33.790" style="s2">and my ability to respond to what is</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.150" end="01:16:35.380" style="s2">happening is allowing me to make</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.790" end="01:16:38.410" style="s2">effective choices by which I mean merely</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.380" end="01:16:40.660" style="s2">I can make choices whereby I am at least</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.410" end="01:16:42.760" style="s2">as well off in the next moment in my</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.660" end="01:16:44.530" style="s2">ability to make good choices as I am now</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.760" end="01:16:46.360" style="s2">and ideally better that&#39;s literally an</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.530" end="01:16:49.030" style="s2">effective choice is nothing but that it</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.360" end="01:16:53.020" style="s2">just means that every choice I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.030" end="01:16:57.580" style="s2">is making my sovereignty better at least</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.020" end="01:16:59.530" style="s2">a little bit so I&#39;m doing that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.580" end="01:17:02.620" style="s2">well I am observing I&#39;m learning from my</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.530" end="01:17:04.810" style="s2">environment I&#39;m walking and everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.620" end="01:17:07.240" style="s2">working out fine and then gunshots break</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.810" end="01:17:07.900" style="s2">out now let&#39;s say I&#39;ve never experienced</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.240" end="01:17:10.030" style="s2">that in my life</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.900" end="01:17:11.440" style="s2">well I&#39;m probably not sovereign to that</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.030" end="01:17:13.810" style="s2">environment you can imagine like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.440" end="01:17:15.840" style="s2">sphere of sovereignty either collapses</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.810" end="01:17:17.820" style="s2">or you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.840" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">there&#39;s like a dot inside my sphere and</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.820" end="01:17:22.200" style="s2">suddenly the dot moves way out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:24.240" style="s2">outside of my sphere of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.200" end="01:17:26.460" style="s2">well at a meta sovereign level there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.240" end="01:17:29.370" style="s2">an ability to be aware of where you are</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.460" end="01:17:31.380" style="s2">oh I am NOT sovereign right now well</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.370" end="01:17:32.360" style="s2">what do I do now we get back to him at a</p>

<p begin="01:17:32.360" end="01:17:37.590" style="s2">well you better drop into liminality you</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.680" end="01:17:39.990" style="s2">better drop into doing the best you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.590" end="01:17:42.750" style="s2">to open up not think you know what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:18:01.110" end="01:18:04.560" style="s2">respond to absolute chaos is to actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.970" end="01:18:07.130" style="s2">go into a completely liminal state and</p>

<p begin="01:18:11.730" end="01:18:15.900" style="s2">part of the story so let me now go to</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.100" end="01:18:17.250" style="s2">the other part of the story this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.900" end="01:18:18.600" style="s2">sovereignty and by the way at this point</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.250" end="01:18:20.220" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re gonna have to stop</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.530" end="01:18:38.340" style="s2">discernment and embodiment so integrity</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.590" end="01:18:41.580" style="s2">is bringing all aspects of yourself into</p>

<p begin="01:19:42.780" end="01:19:46.650" style="s2">the thing that men have a hard time with</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.070" end="01:19:47.310" style="s2">that bringing all the aspects of</p>

<p begin="01:19:47.310" end="01:19:56.610" style="s2">actually requires that you oftentimes</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.610" end="01:20:05.100" style="s2">not with harshness men be beat ourselves</p>

<p begin="01:20:05.100" end="01:20:09.390" style="s2">you not beat yourself up because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.040" end="01:20:11.130" style="s2">just an ineffective way of learning it</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.390" end="01:20:12.990" style="s2">just shuts down learning it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.130" end="01:20:16.320" style="s2">way to learn how do you would actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.990" end="01:20:18.240" style="s2">say okay wasn&#39;t the way I don&#39;t learned</p>

<p begin="01:20:18.240" end="01:20:22.500" style="s2">time I just did a better just imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.090" end="01:20:26.000" style="s2">you were trying to be a really good dad</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.500" end="01:20:28.050" style="s2">to a young son like a four year old son</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.000" end="01:20:29.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea so come into</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.050" end="01:20:32.550" style="s2">relationship with yourself from that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.460" end="01:20:34.800" style="s2">perspective and slowly but surely learn</p>

<p begin="01:20:37.980" end="01:20:44.700" style="s2">integrity okay second discernment well</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.410" end="01:20:46.680" style="s2">discernment is kind of like tuning your</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.700" end="01:20:47.910" style="s2">instruments if we say that yourself all</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.680" end="01:20:50.610" style="s2">the aspects of yourself are your</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.910" end="01:20:52.440" style="s2">instrument how do you allow now how do</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.610" end="01:20:55.770" style="s2">you learn how to listen to all those</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.440" end="01:20:59.340" style="s2">aspects how do you attune to how you</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.770" end="01:21:03.330" style="s2">yourself as a singular kind of being are</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.340" end="01:21:07.770" style="s2">able to sense what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.330" end="01:21:09.660" style="s2">world and this involves a lot of doing a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.770" end="01:21:11.130" style="s2">lot of practice like it&#39;s it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.660" end="01:21:13.440" style="s2">okay let&#39;s go into the world let&#39;s do</p>

<p begin="01:21:13.440" end="01:21:18.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say challenging things to our</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.560" end="01:21:21.630" style="s2">co-workers in boss and then notice</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.720" end="01:21:22.950" style="s2">what&#39;s happening what felt what ended up</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.630" end="01:21:26.520" style="s2">being a good choice rather than it being</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.950" end="01:21:28.230" style="s2">a bad choice with a curiosity and a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.520" end="01:21:30.660" style="s2">gentleness but also instead that</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.230" end="01:21:33.860" style="s2">fastness and a perseverance which by the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.660" end="01:21:35.970" style="s2">way is just called learning and</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.860" end="01:21:37.890" style="s2">recognized by the way that as you do</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.970" end="01:21:39.870" style="s2">that and as you recognize that you have</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.890" end="01:21:41.370" style="s2">there&#39;s always more options than you</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.870" end="01:21:43.240" style="s2">think you have it&#39;s always a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.370" end="01:21:45.280" style="s2">context than you&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.240" end="01:21:48.430" style="s2">and every other human being in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.280" end="01:21:51.370" style="s2">history of ever is just as up and</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.430" end="01:21:53.440" style="s2">limited as you are so okay might as well</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.370" end="01:21:55.720" style="s2">just start where you are and start going</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.440" end="01:21:58.390" style="s2">you can begin the process of discernment</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.720" end="01:22:01.210" style="s2">and really learning how to listen to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.390" end="01:22:03.420" style="s2">instrument who you are and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.210" end="01:22:08.260" style="s2">for me a lot of physical metaphors work</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.420" end="01:22:11.860" style="s2">shooting a bow or a gun a rifle shooting</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.260" end="01:22:14.770" style="s2">a basketball if you like of a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.860" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">skateboarding or dancing these are all</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.770" end="01:22:18.760" style="s2">places that many men can be familiar</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:20.620" style="s2">with that notion like learning how to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.760" end="01:22:24.400" style="s2">shoot a basketball that when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.620" end="01:22:27.450" style="s2">kid it takes a certain way of listening</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.400" end="01:22:29.740" style="s2">to something that you have no idea and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.450" end="01:22:31.300" style="s2">then you just try and then you listen</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.740" end="01:22:33.130" style="s2">and you try and you listen and you try</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.300" end="01:22:34.240" style="s2">and you listen and suddenly you start to</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.130" end="01:22:35.950" style="s2">get ahead the hang of it</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.240" end="01:22:38.440" style="s2">I&#39;ll just imagine extending that out to</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.950" end="01:22:39.790" style="s2">all of reality and you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.440" end="01:22:46.360" style="s2">prodding or the process of discernment</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.790" end="01:22:47.860" style="s2">and then the third is embodiment the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.360" end="01:22:50.530" style="s2">third aspect of sovereignty what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.860" end="01:22:57.330" style="s2">by embodiment is very much to</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.530" end="01:22:57.330" style="s2">distinguish knowing from mastering so</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.100" end="01:23:04.930" style="s2">when I grew up in Texas and I remember</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.830" end="01:23:08.200" style="s2">actually in college being interested in</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.930" end="01:23:08.800" style="s2">learning how to play roller hockey so</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.200" end="01:23:10.300" style="s2">what did I do</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.800" end="01:23:12.940" style="s2">I went to the library and checked out a</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.300" end="01:23:14.710" style="s2">book I sort of liked the Soviet the guy</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.940" end="01:23:17.860" style="s2">who invented the Soviet hockey system I</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.710" end="01:23:18.820" style="s2">read how to play hockey well as you</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.860" end="01:23:21.790" style="s2">might imagine that&#39;s not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.820" end="01:23:24.370" style="s2">useful there&#39;s a pretty obvious</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.790" end="01:23:25.630" style="s2">distinction between book learning and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.370" end="01:23:29.260" style="s2">embodiment when it comes to things that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.630" end="01:23:30.820" style="s2">are very much of the body sports but</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.260" end="01:23:32.770" style="s2">what I would like to suggest is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.820" end="01:23:36.900" style="s2">that same distinction is true in all</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.770" end="01:23:39.970" style="s2">things mathematicians and physicists are</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.900" end="01:23:44.200" style="s2">kind of aware of this that if you were</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.970" end="01:23:46.930" style="s2">to ask say Einstein where the process of</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.200" end="01:23:48.670" style="s2">his insight comes from he may very well</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.930" end="01:23:50.530" style="s2">like point to parts of his physical body</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.670" end="01:23:53.590" style="s2">like yeah that&#39;s my elbow it&#39;s the back</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.530" end="01:23:56.170" style="s2">of my neck it&#39;s he&#39;s really allowing the</p>

<p begin="01:24:00.850" end="01:24:04.390" style="s2">acting from naturalness and being aware</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.130" end="01:24:05.290" style="s2">of the difference like being aware of</p>

<p begin="01:24:19.060" end="01:24:23.410" style="s2">consider the fact that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.110" end="01:24:25.630" style="s2">how first and then allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.410" end="01:24:28.360" style="s2">learn the process of just fluidly and</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.630" end="01:24:30.400" style="s2">slowly taking the time to allow your</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.360" end="01:24:32.890" style="s2">discernment in this context to build</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.400" end="01:24:34.750" style="s2">until the process of being a</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.890" end="01:24:37.720" style="s2">skateboarder has become embodied and</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.750" end="01:24:38.890" style="s2">doing no more that is in fact precisely</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.720" end="01:24:42.310" style="s2">at what might be called your</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.890" end="01:24:43.510" style="s2">evolutionary edge okay I can stand in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.310" end="01:24:44.920" style="s2">skateboard and I can write it down a</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.510" end="01:24:48.040" style="s2">hill and I can turn and I can stop</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.920" end="01:24:52.570" style="s2">awesome now I might try to learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.040" end="01:24:54.340" style="s2">ollie not before after and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.570" end="01:24:56.410" style="s2">idea right and I&#39;m keeping it really</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.340" end="01:24:58.510" style="s2">simple but it&#39;s it is actually that</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.410" end="01:25:01.300" style="s2">simple you know Jordan Peterson says</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.510" end="01:25:03.070" style="s2">clean your room I&#39;m saying the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.300" end="01:25:05.470" style="s2">thing and by the way if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.070" end="01:25:09.760" style="s2">learn how to start sovereignty start</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.470" end="01:25:11.110" style="s2">with yourself then start with your the</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.760" end="01:25:14.560" style="s2">people who you love the most</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.110" end="01:25:17.290" style="s2">right if you can get past that give me a</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.560" end="01:25:19.300" style="s2">call right well that that is an</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.290" end="01:25:20.560" style="s2">excellent description of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.300" end="01:25:21.880" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve been driving out over</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.560" end="01:25:25.120" style="s2">the last couple of years and I and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.880" end="01:25:26.950" style="s2">brought this up because of the way that</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.120" end="01:25:28.450" style="s2">I think men are feeling sort of confused</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.950" end="01:25:30.310" style="s2">by all the misdirection and</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.450" end="01:25:33.460" style="s2">misinformation that&#39;s out there also</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.310" end="01:25:35.200" style="s2">feeling attacked as the American the no</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.460" end="01:25:38.080" style="s2">the APA just comes out and actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.200" end="01:25:40.060" style="s2">pathologize his traditional roles of</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.080" end="01:25:43.270" style="s2">masculinity and I think that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.060" end="01:25:45.780" style="s2">sort of grasping for a sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.270" end="01:25:47.980" style="s2">does it mean to be a you know a</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.780" end="01:25:49.720" style="s2">positively masculine male and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.980" end="01:25:50.890" style="s2">culture today and and when I started</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.720" end="01:25:51.970" style="s2">reading about your sense of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.890" end="01:25:53.950" style="s2">and especially now when you add</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.970" end="01:25:55.360" style="s2">integrity discernment embodiment to it</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.950" end="01:25:57.760" style="s2">and I realize these are applicable to</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.360" end="01:26:00.490" style="s2">women as well but really I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.760" end="01:26:05.230" style="s2">that I&#39;ve come across a better summation</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.490" end="01:26:07.900" style="s2">of a 21st century positive masculinity</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.230" end="01:26:09.070" style="s2">and how guys can can take these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.900" end="01:26:12.070" style="s2">all I mean man there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.070" end="01:26:13.630" style="s2">in each these elements the air but then</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.070" end="01:26:16.510" style="s2">begin to apply them in their own lives</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.630" end="01:26:18.550" style="s2">and use them to work their way through</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.510" end="01:26:21.060" style="s2">this information battlefield that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.550" end="01:26:23.590" style="s2">there and the the disinformation and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.060" end="01:26:26.050" style="s2">ongoing sort of information warfare</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.590" end="01:26:28.900" style="s2">that&#39;s out there the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.050" end="01:26:30.280" style="s2">masculinity the attack on on sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.900" end="01:26:32.320" style="s2">making and information and all this</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.280" end="01:26:34.330" style="s2">confusion that we have and yeah I have</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.320" end="01:26:35.680" style="s2">always advocated for guys to you start</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.330" end="01:26:37.570" style="s2">with yourself first you put yourself</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.680" end="01:26:39.430" style="s2">first and you take care of your family</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.570" end="01:26:41.470" style="s2">and maybe you can take care of your</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.430" end="01:26:42.790" style="s2">community and maybe your city and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.470" end="01:26:44.290" style="s2">maybe your nation and maybe the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.790" end="01:26:45.970" style="s2">but you know first first start with</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.290" end="01:26:48.040" style="s2">yourself it can I can I just catch up</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.970" end="01:26:51.910" style="s2">more thin yeah yeah just think something</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.040" end="01:26:53.500" style="s2">something really showed up so I wrote an</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.910" end="01:26:54.970" style="s2">essay because I was really really</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.500" end="01:26:57.220" style="s2">curious about the question of courage</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.970" end="01:26:58.480" style="s2">and I was trying to really contemplate</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.220" end="01:26:59.740" style="s2">it and I don&#39;t know if I did a</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.480" end="01:27:04.780" style="s2">particularly good job but something</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.740" end="01:27:06.670" style="s2">showed up for me they were useful the</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.780" end="01:27:10.570" style="s2">courage to storm Normandy Beach is real</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.670" end="01:27:13.470" style="s2">for sure that obviously none of us have</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.570" end="01:27:16.030" style="s2">done anything vaguely like that nothing</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.470" end="01:27:18.310" style="s2">the curb the courage is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.030" end="01:27:19.870" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.310" end="01:27:23.800" style="s2">courage right people aren&#39;t just firing</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.870" end="01:27:26.860" style="s2">bullets at us so we don&#39;t get to watch</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.800" end="01:27:28.000" style="s2">our best friend&#39;s head explode they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.860" end="01:27:30.190" style="s2">firing different things so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.000" end="01:27:33.430" style="s2">different kind of courage but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.190" end="01:27:36.340" style="s2">courage that&#39;s the ability to stand in</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.430" end="01:27:39.160" style="s2">front of the slings and arrows of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.340" end="01:27:42.460" style="s2">you know the AMA pathologizing</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.160" end="01:27:43.030" style="s2">masculinity is what I call infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.460" end="01:27:44.980" style="s2">courage</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.030" end="01:27:49.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a courage that actually requires</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.980" end="01:27:51.520" style="s2">that you be able to stand and not and</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.870" end="01:27:53.530" style="s2">feel it it hurts right if you hear</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.520" end="01:27:56.490" style="s2">there&#39;s pain there for sure and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.530" end="01:27:58.930" style="s2">just pain it&#39;s harm it&#39;s real threat yes</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.490" end="01:28:03.580" style="s2">but you can&#39;t respond in it in the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.930" end="01:28:04.690" style="s2">way you can&#39;t shoot back and so what was</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.580" end="01:28:08.680" style="s2">coming up for me as you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.690" end="01:28:10.630" style="s2">it is that 2,000 years ago and this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.680" end="01:28:12.490" style="s2">going to come very odd coming from me</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.630" end="01:28:14.260" style="s2">because my background is vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.490" end="01:28:17.050" style="s2">religious but 2,000 years ago we were</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.260" end="01:28:20.380" style="s2">given an opportunity on occasion to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.050" end="01:28:24.160" style="s2">more christ-like I would say right</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.380" end="01:28:26.680" style="s2">that that is in fact mandatory yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.160" end="01:28:29.500" style="s2">is no longer a matter of that might be a</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.680" end="01:28:30.970" style="s2">neat thing to do for a few folks the</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.500" end="01:28:32.500" style="s2">kind of sovereignty were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.970" end="01:28:36.930" style="s2">the kind of courage we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.500" end="01:28:42.190" style="s2">is precisely the kind of courage that</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.930" end="01:28:43.720" style="s2">Christ represents that is a amazing</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.190" end="01:28:46.300" style="s2">point that you brought up in something I</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.720" end="01:28:47.890" style="s2">could probably talk for hours about but</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.300" end="01:28:50.470" style="s2">we&#39;ll put it as they say a pin in that</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.890" end="01:28:53.260" style="s2">one yeah and and on the the last note</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.470" end="01:28:54.940" style="s2">that I just I want to touch is that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.260" end="01:28:57.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t really get too much into the read</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.940" end="01:29:00.430" style="s2">read resistance or the read religion or</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.180" end="01:29:02.620" style="s2">as you very aptly and John rabe also</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.430" end="01:29:05.320" style="s2">described and I put in my book how the</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.620" end="01:29:07.330" style="s2">blue church and the the ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.320" end="01:29:09.850" style="s2">they&#39;ve spread have created a situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.330" end="01:29:11.470" style="s2">in which the only people left to resist</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.850" end="01:29:14.650" style="s2">it are those who are actually now immune</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.470" end="01:29:17.490" style="s2">to the tactics of the blue church and so</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.650" end="01:29:19.540" style="s2">when people ask me what can we do my</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.490" end="01:29:21.100" style="s2">point to them is always start with</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.540" end="01:29:24.010" style="s2">yourself what we have to do is actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.100" end="01:29:25.390" style="s2">build real communities and it starts</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.010" end="01:29:26.920" style="s2">with individuals and it starts with</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.390" end="01:29:28.990" style="s2">having an inner strengths and it starts</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.920" end="01:29:31.630" style="s2">without as low strikes and it starts</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.990" end="01:29:33.790" style="s2">with this this the notion of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.630" end="01:29:34.930" style="s2">and then expanding it as you can to</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.790" end="01:29:36.460" style="s2">around to the people that you love and</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.930" end="01:29:39.040" style="s2">the people that you&#39;ve now elect to</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.460" end="01:29:41.530" style="s2">commune with and to me that is the</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.040" end="01:29:43.480" style="s2">answer to sort of combating what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.530" end="01:29:44.710" style="s2">happening and again there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.480" end="01:29:47.590" style="s2">topics we could have covered and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.710" end="01:29:49.320" style="s2">just in very two seconds touch on you</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.590" end="01:29:53.320" style="s2">were you mentioned in social media</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.320" end="01:29:56.530" style="s2">making weak affiliations versus strong</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.320" end="01:29:58.270" style="s2">connections and social media presents us</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.530" end="01:29:59.860" style="s2">with opportunity to replace our strong</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.270" end="01:30:02.980" style="s2">connections with these weak affiliations</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.860" end="01:30:04.480" style="s2">and so well I will commend my guys and</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.980" end="01:30:07.210" style="s2">the community that I work in and that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.480" end="01:30:09.490" style="s2">specifically create real time real-life</p>

<p begin="01:30:16.840" end="01:30:23.260" style="s2">media to create strong actual real world</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.930" end="01:30:26.080" style="s2">bonds to transmit many of these messages</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.260" end="01:30:27.730" style="s2">that we&#39;re discussing here and so to my</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.080" end="01:30:29.590" style="s2">guys out there you know after we listen</p>
