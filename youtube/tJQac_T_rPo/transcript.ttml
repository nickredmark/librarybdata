<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:51.409" style="s2">know um so as you where we talk a lot on</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">this podcast about self development and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.409" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">you help people to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">world sense-making preventing global</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:05.070" style="s2">catastrophic risks so in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">way that the world is at the moment what</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.070" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">are your thoughts about how people can</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.340" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">develop themselves while still ensuring</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">that we have a functioning world that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t isn&#39;t risky we can go like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">million places with that question and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:32.730" style="s2">we&#39;ll just start and see what see what</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:36.300" style="s2">happens even the topic of personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.730" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">development what that means is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.300" end="00:01:41.370" style="s2">ambiguous the idea of development means</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">that something can progress to some</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.370" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">stage of more refinement or more</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">capacity and so we know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">in mathematics or in playing classical</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">piano or weightlifting right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">some sense of progressive development</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">but what does it mean for a person to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">develop beyond early adulthood we also</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:02.300" style="s2">have a very clear sense that children go</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">through developmental stages of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.300" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">increasing their cognitive and social</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">and linguistic and motor and all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:10.649" style="s2">types of capacities but then when does</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">that stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.649" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">does it have to stop there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:17.129" style="s2">development of more skills but what does</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:20.430" style="s2">becoming a more developed human being</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.129" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">fundamentally mean is a philosophic is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.430" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">spiritual religious existential question</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">and to the question of what is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.430" end="00:02:34.409" style="s2">meaningful human life is underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">and then how do I effectively develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.409" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">myself align with what is most</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">meaningful and when I&#39;m asking what is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">meaningful human life there&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">my own experience but how do I relate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">the whole of life how does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.340" style="s2">meaningfulness of life relate to both</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">what I experience and also what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.340" end="00:03:02.489" style="s2">contribute to the experience of others</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:04.829" style="s2">and so when we think about the current</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.489" end="00:03:06.989" style="s2">world situation does the world situation</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.829" end="00:03:08.609" style="s2">were in create a context for what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.989" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">of human development are relevant within</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.609" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">the general parameters of some universal</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:18.410" style="s2">truths and it certainly does because</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">what the world needs if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.410" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">really effectively serve to protect</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:25.139" style="s2">against unnecessary harm and to increase</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:26.790" style="s2">the quality of life it needs different</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.139" end="00:03:31.079" style="s2">skills than it needed a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.790" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">ago and it needs different it actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.079" end="00:03:37.560" style="s2">needs totally different kinds of minds</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">and sense-making in many ways and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:40.769" style="s2">some aspects of it are obviously going</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">to be the same across lots of contexts</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.769" end="00:03:47.329" style="s2">like the refinement of our clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">our own motivation and our own emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.329" end="00:03:53.220" style="s2">resilience and things like that I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:56.040" style="s2">the motivation is an interesting one to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.220" end="00:03:58.379" style="s2">start on which is as soon as you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.040" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">concept of human development and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.379" end="00:04:03.239" style="s2">some concept of more developed and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:05.770" style="s2">can conceptually understand that to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.239" end="00:04:10.050" style="s2">and orient yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.770" end="00:04:12.160" style="s2">then there becomes an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.050" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">comparison with other people of are</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.160" end="00:04:18.670" style="s2">they&#39;ve comprehensively more developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:20.470" style="s2">human than I am and or am i more than</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.670" end="00:04:22.030" style="s2">they are and is my thinking that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.470" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">more than they are some sign of ego</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.030" end="00:04:27.910" style="s2">which is actually a sign of low</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">development in some particular way and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.910" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to cognitively understand what</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:37.270" style="s2">some higher stage of development would</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">Express like and be able to act it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.270" end="00:04:44.350" style="s2">without it actually being real and so as</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">soon as there&#39;s you know you read David</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.350" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">it--and you have the an authentic man is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:50.950" style="s2">such and such or embodied woman is such</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:52.900" style="s2">and such or whatever well you can just</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.950" end="00:04:56.340" style="s2">start acting that and having it be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.900" end="00:04:56.340" style="s2">totally not real and having</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:04.139" style="s2">a bunch of personal development</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.210" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">mimicking for basically status seeking</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.139" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">and what&#39;s underneath that the status</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">seeking impulse which is usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:14.190" style="s2">fundamental insecurities is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">healing itself which would the real</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.190" end="00:05:17.669" style="s2">personal development would be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:19.590" style="s2">actually doubling down on itself in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.669" end="00:05:21.540" style="s2">building up a presentation package and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.590" end="00:05:23.070" style="s2">whether it&#39;s I&#39;m rich or I&#39;m buff or M</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.540" end="00:05:27.180" style="s2">enlightened just depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.070" end="00:05:30.260" style="s2">subculture you&#39;re appealing to that is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.180" end="00:05:34.289" style="s2">very hard red pill to swallow and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.260" end="00:05:37.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t agree more the there&#39;s a quote</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.289" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">from member John who says that character</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.350" end="00:05:41.820" style="s2">will always beat strategy</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:43.620" style="s2">he&#39;s a CrossFit coach and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.820" end="00:05:45.900" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about there is the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.620" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">of doing the thing because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">thing that you want to do from your</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:54.120" style="s2">innermost being as opposed to doing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">thing because that&#39;s what you think you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.120" end="00:05:58.260" style="s2">should do based on what you&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2">so that you can then signal that you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.260" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">a person who has these virtues it&#39;s tart</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.500" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">horse or horse cart when you mention</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">virtue signaling which will obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">show very differently in different</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:16.260" style="s2">cultures right I&#39;m a good Republican</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">versus I&#39;m a good Democrat is going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.260" end="00:06:21.479" style="s2">have totally it&#39;ll be repulsive to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:23.460" style="s2">people of the different tribe or</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.479" end="00:06:27.780" style="s2">religions or different types of</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.780" end="00:06:31.580" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s mostly just mate</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.580" end="00:06:39.099" style="s2">and so whether it&#39;s a 150 foot super</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.330" end="00:06:39.099" style="s2">yacht or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.939" style="s2">you know having read all the books in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.199" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">particular space and presenting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.939" end="00:06:49.340" style="s2">in a way that we say okay well where is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:51.560" style="s2">that imperative to want people to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.340" end="00:06:53.389" style="s2">respond to me in a particular way well</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.560" end="00:06:54.919" style="s2">it has something to do with power</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.389" end="00:06:57.860" style="s2">dynamics in a tribe and largely</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.919" end="00:07:00.620" style="s2">basically mate signaling is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.860" end="00:07:03.590" style="s2">evolutionary origin of it it&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.620" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">to just admit that and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.590" end="00:07:07.930" style="s2">reflect on it to say the more I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.680" end="00:07:09.889" style="s2">reflect on the biological</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.930" end="00:07:12.979" style="s2">predispositions that arise the less I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.889" end="00:07:14.569" style="s2">controlled by them and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.979" end="00:07:16.580" style="s2">be ashamed of a repressed they more just</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.569" end="00:07:18.889" style="s2">automatically go with them right because</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.580" end="00:07:20.840" style="s2">they gave rise to the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.889" end="00:07:24.289" style="s2">abstraction and the abstraction can give</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.840" end="00:07:29.240" style="s2">rise to higher order interests than the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.289" end="00:07:30.889" style="s2">base interests so this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:37.699" style="s2">very valuable thing in personal</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.889" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">development is just taking the time to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.699" end="00:07:41.550" style="s2">very deeply earnestly inquire into your</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.849" style="s2">motive</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.550" end="00:07:49.470" style="s2">and okay I&#39;m wanting to develop in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.849" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">way why is because mostly the Y&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:56.940" style="s2">actually lies right it&#39;s I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">when I&#39;m buff then I will dot dot dot</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.940" end="00:08:00.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s not gonna be true</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:07.009" style="s2">right so the thing happens and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.780" end="00:08:10.470" style="s2">just some other set of goals and and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.009" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">typically whenever someone is going</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.470" end="00:08:15.830" style="s2">about doing some project to help the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:18.690" style="s2">world or develop themselves or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.830" end="00:08:20.159" style="s2">they usually have mixed motives they</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.690" end="00:08:22.710" style="s2">have like a dozen different motives</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.159" end="00:08:25.050" style="s2">driving them and they&#39;re usually only</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.710" end="00:08:26.669" style="s2">aware of half of them and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.050" end="00:08:31.110" style="s2">usually only admit like one or two of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.669" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">them and but this will affect your</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.110" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">results and your trustworthiness because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">those motives will pull in different</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:42.029" style="s2">ways and so let&#39;s say I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:43.320" style="s2">develop myself as someone who&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.029" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">capable of making a difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.320" end="00:08:48.060" style="s2">world and so I&#39;m doing some alleviating</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:49.350" style="s2">poverty project and the read the mission</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.060" end="00:08:51.000" style="s2">statement of why we&#39;re doing this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.350" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">because these kids don&#39;t have shoes and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.000" end="00:08:54.839" style="s2">they don&#39;t have food and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:56.339" style="s2">bring it to them and we care that might</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.839" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">actually be true like I might actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.339" end="00:09:01.470" style="s2">care as one of the twelve or so motives</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:03.750" style="s2">as me doing that I might also need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.470" end="00:09:05.720" style="s2">make some money and this nonprofit is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.750" end="00:09:15.510" style="s2">way that I can make some money I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:17.550" style="s2">might want to feel successful in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.510" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">different way and this hits a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.550" end="00:09:22.470" style="s2">idea of what what will make me feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:25.970" style="s2">successful and then there may be a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.470" end="00:09:28.740" style="s2">of stuff that&#39;s unconscious like</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.970" end="00:09:31.709" style="s2">insecurity from childhood and school and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.740" end="00:09:33.450" style="s2">still wanting to hear that I did a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.709" end="00:09:34.950" style="s2">job that my parents didn&#39;t give me or</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.450" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">that they did project it on to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.950" end="00:09:41.160" style="s2">of the world the degree to which you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">just really watch that right just watch</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.160" end="00:09:44.130" style="s2">the things that are rising in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:45.810" style="s2">and they&#39;ll show up when you notice</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.130" end="00:09:50.010" style="s2">where who you&#39;re comparing yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.810" end="00:09:51.540" style="s2">and where you feel jealousies which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.010" end="00:09:52.649" style="s2">something that you think that your one</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.540" end="00:09:54.900" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.649" end="00:09:58.380" style="s2">getting socially or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.900" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">and just in in reflecting then you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.380" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">ask yourself the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:09.240" style="s2">so which of these seem like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.030" end="00:10:12.690" style="s2">coming from wholeness like from from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.240" end="00:10:14.250" style="s2">deepest whole list version of myself I</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.690" end="00:10:15.720" style="s2">could imagine and which of them feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.250" end="00:10:19.410" style="s2">like they&#39;re more coming from insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.720" end="00:10:21.540" style="s2">or woundedness and if I imagine myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.410" end="00:10:24.020" style="s2">growing in my wholeness which of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.540" end="00:10:26.310" style="s2">would deepen in which would lessen and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:28.530" style="s2">then of the ones that would lessen you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.310" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">can just ask if this wasn&#39;t there at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.530" end="00:10:34.500" style="s2">how would my life be different like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:36.360" style="s2">desire that people like me or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.500" end="00:10:38.100" style="s2">it is this wasn&#39;t there at all and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.360" end="00:10:40.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean to pathologize it just you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.100" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">just get it inquire in that and notice</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.050" end="00:10:44.940" style="s2">how does it move you and maybe some ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.280" style="s2">that it moves you are fine but it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.940" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">to at least be clear on it are those</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.280" end="00:10:52.830" style="s2">some of the signals that people can use</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:54.930" style="s2">to identify that because the pernicious</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.830" end="00:10:56.850" style="s2">thing about our subconscious is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.930" end="00:10:58.490" style="s2">were not conscious of it not without</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.850" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">doing a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.490" end="00:11:03.630" style="s2">introspective work time in solitude and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:09.270" style="s2">all that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.630" end="00:11:12.960" style="s2">so are there any signals that people can</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.270" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">say that&#39;s that&#39;s that thing manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.960" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.260" end="00:11:23.980" style="s2">yeah I mean I think a lot of people if</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.580" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">they just make time kind of already know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.980" end="00:11:32.230" style="s2">what some of the signals are say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.250" style="s2">a project you want to do and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.230" end="00:11:35.170" style="s2">do it because it actually feels</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.250" end="00:11:41.080" style="s2">intrinsically meaningful right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.170" end="00:11:42.910" style="s2">real intrinsic motive and you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.080" end="00:11:44.350" style="s2">about someone else getting credit for it</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.910" end="00:11:45.850" style="s2">you&#39;re not getting credit for it versus</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.350" end="00:11:47.740" style="s2">you getting credit for it you just or</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.850" end="00:11:50.470" style="s2">even notice in the process of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.740" end="00:11:54.040" style="s2">conversation where there is a credit</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.470" end="00:11:56.290" style="s2">seeking impulse arise in you and you say</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.040" end="00:11:58.060" style="s2">oh that impulse and the impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.290" end="00:11:59.500" style="s2">actually serve are not the same impulse</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.060" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">those are two different impulses that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.500" end="00:12:04.990" style="s2">are both arising and they maybe they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">be made to be to sled-dogs pulling in</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.990" end="00:12:08.310" style="s2">the same direction but they might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:10.570" style="s2">sled dogs pulling in opposite directions</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.310" end="00:12:12.220" style="s2">because sometimes the way I can serve</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.570" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">the project best is to let someone else</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.220" end="00:12:18.190" style="s2">take credit so they work harder to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:19.990" style="s2">the thing happen and this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.190" end="00:12:23.110" style="s2">know if you read the daodejing</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.990" end="00:12:25.270" style="s2">as a book of leadership almost it just</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.110" end="00:12:26.709" style="s2">says that thing again and again the best</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.270" end="00:12:28.660" style="s2">leader is the one that nobody even knows</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.709" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">is leading who doesn&#39;t want to lead who</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">other people push to lead because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:40.450" style="s2">trust them and really just empowers</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:44.290" style="s2">everyone else yeah I get it so thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.450" end="00:12:47.380" style="s2">about what this means for people on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.290" end="00:12:49.660" style="s2">broader scale what it means for an</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:52.270" style="s2">individual to understand their</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.660" end="00:12:55.270" style="s2">motivations toward leading a good life I</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.270" end="00:12:58.029" style="s2">think one of the key insights that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.270" end="00:13:03.339" style="s2">had from spending time exposed to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.029" end="00:13:06.100" style="s2">sort of content is that I didn&#39;t for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.339" end="00:13:10.180" style="s2">long time and still mostly don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.100" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">what I want to want truthfully it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.180" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">very hard question to answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.800" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a in processes in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.430" end="00:13:25.420" style="s2">process of development of becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.160" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">self reflexively aware so first you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.420" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">living in a particular way and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:30.040" style="s2">aren&#39;t even really reflecting on if</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way to be living right</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.040" end="00:13:33.700" style="s2">and then you start reflecting on and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">realize oh I&#39;m actually behaving ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.700" end="00:13:38.290" style="s2">that go against the things that I want</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:40.450" style="s2">and so I&#39;m getting angry or I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.290" end="00:13:42.490" style="s2">jealous or I&#39;m whatever it is that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.450" end="00:13:44.260" style="s2">who I really want to be and this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.490" end="00:13:45.670" style="s2">of like tier one the medics and personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.260" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">development let me see if I can work on</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.670" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">changing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:53.030" style="s2">and some people will start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.690" end="00:13:56.080" style="s2">wow that pattern of being angry or being</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.030" end="00:13:59.540" style="s2">habituated or whatever being lazy was</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.080" end="00:14:01.880" style="s2">conditioned in me because had I grown up</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:03.560" style="s2">with the Sioux Indians or with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.880" end="00:14:05.030" style="s2">matcha Ganga tribe or whatever I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.560" end="00:14:06.470" style="s2">be different right like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.030" end="00:14:08.270" style="s2">question that there would be a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.470" end="00:14:12.110" style="s2">me that&#39;s different so I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.270" end="00:14:13.640" style="s2">just be the kind of default byproduct of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:15.640" style="s2">how I happen to grow up that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.640" end="00:14:18.230" style="s2">even really have a say in where I chose</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.640" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">so can i recondition it&#39;s like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.230" end="00:14:22.430" style="s2">can recondition it then there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.980" style="s2">more reflection it says so I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.430" end="00:14:26.450" style="s2">recondition my behaviors to be more</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.980" end="00:14:28.850" style="s2">aligned with what I want and what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.450" end="00:14:33.650" style="s2">value they&#39;re like fuck what I want what</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.850" end="00:14:35.330" style="s2">I value is conditioned also because do I</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.650" end="00:14:37.010" style="s2">want to be a good Christian or I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.330" end="00:14:40.670" style="s2">be a good Muslim or I want to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.010" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">Hindu or a good scientist do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.670" end="00:14:44.750" style="s2">be a Wall Street banker or a good family</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:46.670" style="s2">man do I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.750" end="00:14:50.710" style="s2">that was probably also conditioned right</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.670" end="00:14:52.850" style="s2">all the way down to your your</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.710" end="00:14:55.460" style="s2">metaphysical framework for what reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.850" end="00:14:58.100" style="s2">is and what the good life is in there</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.460" end="00:15:01.460" style="s2">now you&#39;ve entered the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.100" end="00:15:06.170" style="s2">existentialism because you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.460" end="00:15:07.970" style="s2">what is worth wanting and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.170" end="00:15:10.400" style="s2">to say well what is the basis to answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.970" end="00:15:12.980" style="s2">that that wasn&#39;t just conditioned is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.400" end="00:15:14.210" style="s2">there some deeper than my conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.980" end="00:15:16.100" style="s2">basis can i pierce through the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.210" end="00:15:18.950" style="s2">conditioning and so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.100" end="00:15:20.360" style="s2">ask is is there anything intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.950" end="00:15:23.420" style="s2">meaningful about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.360" end="00:15:24.950" style="s2">that I can come to understand that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.420" end="00:15:27.050" style="s2">beyond where I happen to have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.950" end="00:15:28.190" style="s2">conditioned where regardless of where I</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.050" end="00:15:33.380" style="s2">would have been conditioned this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.190" end="00:15:37.250" style="s2">something I could come to and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.380" end="00:15:39.950" style="s2">out that there are meaningful ways to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.250" end="00:15:42.860" style="s2">address that tell us that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.950" end="00:15:46.220" style="s2">here for Tania we are here to to find</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.860" end="00:15:48.020" style="s2">out about that there&#39;s different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.220" end="00:15:52.190" style="s2">approaching this that have validity so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.020" end="00:15:54.790" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna say what the truth of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.190" end="00:15:58.070" style="s2">meaningful life is but I&#39;ll say some</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.790" end="00:16:00.080" style="s2">ways that I have found and that others I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.070" end="00:16:00.910" style="s2">have seen have found that are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.080" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.910" end="00:16:14.380" style="s2">also acknowledged you can walk one or</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">multiple of these paths I forget the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.380" end="00:16:17.710" style="s2">author there&#39;s a famous quote the heart</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:23.730" style="s2">knows reasons the reason knows nothing</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.710" end="00:16:26.590" style="s2">of and there is a kind of poetic</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.730" end="00:16:31.300" style="s2">artistic answer to the question which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.590" end="00:16:33.960" style="s2">it just is right there&#39;s a deep there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.300" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">a sense of this is meaningful because</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.960" end="00:16:38.290" style="s2">it&#39;ll serve this and then that because</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:40.870" style="s2">this and then at a certain level there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.290" end="00:16:46.080" style="s2">a sense of just prima facie it just is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.870" end="00:16:47.950" style="s2">and like life life is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.080" end="00:16:52.650" style="s2">meaningful and worth serving</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.950" end="00:16:54.970" style="s2">why just it&#39;s right there&#39;s no deeper</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.650" end="00:16:57.340" style="s2">explanation that adds more clarification</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.970" end="00:17:00.430" style="s2">than that it is based on your own direct</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.340" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">experience of your experience of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.430" end="00:17:04.420" style="s2">aliveness feeling intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:06.550" style="s2">meaningful and then you&#39;re sensing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.420" end="00:17:08.170" style="s2">depth of other people&#39;s experience of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.550" end="00:17:10.660" style="s2">life and seeing that that&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.170" end="00:17:13.090" style="s2">in your desire to serve life in that way</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.660" end="00:17:16.570" style="s2">and it just enter the answer there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.090" end="00:17:21.390" style="s2">not really a deep philosophical inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.570" end="00:17:21.390" style="s2">it&#39;s more about a felt experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.110" end="00:17:34.239" style="s2">that&#39;s great and you know the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.789" end="00:17:35.830" style="s2">verse of the Tao Te Ching is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.239" end="00:17:37.269" style="s2">knowledge that is knowable is not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.830" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">eternal knowledge and the Dao that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.269" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">speakable is not the eternal Dao</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.580" end="00:17:46.789" style="s2">which means the to translate the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:49.149" style="s2">or the purpose of everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.789" end="00:17:54.100" style="s2">can describe in words isn&#39;t really it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.149" end="00:17:54.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s fundamentally transom antic</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.760" end="00:17:59.210" style="s2">semantics is a symbol that has a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:01.340" style="s2">finite meaning that is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.210" end="00:18:04.269" style="s2">represent a certain ground right like</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.340" end="00:18:05.899" style="s2">the word Apple references Apple you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.269" end="00:18:08.779" style="s2">but when I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.899" end="00:18:10.789" style="s2">meaningfulness of reality there is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.779" end="00:18:15.110" style="s2">word that can actually hold the ground</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.789" end="00:18:17.500" style="s2">of everything and so there can be though</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.110" end="00:18:20.919" style="s2">a certain kind of felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.500" end="00:18:20.919" style="s2">connectedness with it</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:25.590" style="s2">now we can also think about it more and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.669" end="00:18:27.330" style="s2">come up with better answers and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.590" end="00:18:28.649" style="s2">actually nice when we do both of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.330" end="00:18:30.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s a confluence of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.649" end="00:18:32.669" style="s2">deepening of our own felt connection and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.600" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">the deepening of the clarity of how we</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.669" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.460" end="00:18:49.799" style="s2">so some people go to landmark and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.700" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">starts with well I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.799" end="00:18:58.110" style="s2">what landmark says there there are some</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">systems that will say reality is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.110" end="00:19:02.549" style="s2">fundamentally meaningless and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:05.510" style="s2">empowering and beautiful because you get</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.549" end="00:19:09.390" style="s2">to create the meaning there isn&#39;t some a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.510" end="00:19:11.340" style="s2">priori God that said this is how you win</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.390" end="00:19:13.260" style="s2">the race at the end and you either get</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.340" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">it right or you get it wrong by some you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.260" end="00:19:21.020" style="s2">know predefined definition that can feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:24.390" style="s2">empowering there&#39;s actually some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:26.280" style="s2">metaphysics smuggled in there which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.390" end="00:19:29.309" style="s2">to say you get to create the meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.280" end="00:19:31.049" style="s2">still actually holding some concept of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.309" end="00:19:33.809" style="s2">meaningfulness and the value on your own</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.049" end="00:19:35.250" style="s2">creativity right so there it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.809" end="00:19:37.710" style="s2">actually doing the deeper inquiry to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.250" end="00:19:40.230" style="s2">well why do I value choice why do I</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.710" end="00:19:45.750" style="s2">value creativity and what is the basis</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.230" end="00:19:47.700" style="s2">for meaningfulness my own assessment so</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.750" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">again those are just in prima facia held</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.700" end="00:20:02.309" style="s2">as meaningful so science is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.630" end="00:20:07.049" style="s2">trying to come to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.309" end="00:20:09.570" style="s2">objective world in a way that goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.049" end="00:20:11.850" style="s2">beyond my own subjective sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.570" end="00:20:15.179" style="s2">it is which means beyond my conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.850" end="00:20:17.610" style="s2">and my bias right and so I might think</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.179" end="00:20:20.190" style="s2">this sound travels faster than light at</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.610" end="00:20:21.900" style="s2">room temperature and air so I set up an</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.190" end="00:20:24.030" style="s2">experiment and measure it and I find out</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.900" end="00:20:26.490" style="s2">that it just doesn&#39;t and then I can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.030" end="00:20:27.870" style="s2">that a hundred times or a million times</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.490" end="00:20:32.130" style="s2">and other people can do it we can use</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.870" end="00:20:33.870" style="s2">different apparatus and there is a the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.130" end="00:20:35.280" style="s2">measure ability and the repeatability</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.870" end="00:20:39.809" style="s2">gives us a certain sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.280" end="00:20:41.580" style="s2">objectivity of it right well so science</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.809" end="00:20:44.940" style="s2">has done a very good job of giving us a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.580" end="00:20:49.289" style="s2">framework for is what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.940" end="00:20:51.210" style="s2">that is not based on what I think is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.289" end="00:20:54.809" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it hasn&#39;t given us the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.210" end="00:20:59.099" style="s2">basis for what ought to be and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.809" end="00:21:01.499" style="s2">this classic division between science</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.099" end="00:21:04.049" style="s2">and ethics or science and existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.499" end="00:21:05.789" style="s2">called the is aught distinction science</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.049" end="00:21:08.249" style="s2">can say what is it can&#39;t say what aught</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.789" end="00:21:10.970" style="s2">because the process of science is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.249" end="00:21:10.970" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.810" end="00:21:17.260" style="s2">observing and measuring observable</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.870" end="00:21:20.150" style="s2">things which are inherently third-person</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.260" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">objects and then being able to find</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:30.680" style="s2">I can express in something like math and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.290" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">so it pertains to the domain of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.139" end="00:21:47.049" style="s2">experience is measurable because we can</p>

<p begin="00:22:01.419" end="00:22:06.920" style="s2">idea what the experience is like</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.650" end="00:22:08.870" style="s2">and so the fact that there might be some</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.870" end="00:22:11.450" style="s2">mean you&#39;re measuring the experience it</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:12.530" style="s2">means there&#39;s some neural correlate</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.450" end="00:22:14.270" style="s2">right but that&#39;s still the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.530" end="00:22:17.990" style="s2">third person which is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.270" end="00:22:20.450" style="s2">never first person</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.990" end="00:22:24.200" style="s2">so first person is outside of the domain</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.450" end="00:22:26.990" style="s2">of science formally this is important</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.200" end="00:22:29.750" style="s2">because it says science is not a method</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.750" end="00:22:33.529" style="s2">knowing parts of reality and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.909" end="00:22:38.059" style="s2">parts of reality that are rigorously</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.529" end="00:22:39.950" style="s2">outside of the methods of science but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.059" end="00:22:41.750" style="s2">want something like we had with science</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.950" end="00:22:45.350" style="s2">which was a better process of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.750" end="00:22:47.510" style="s2">and so are there better processes of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.350" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">knowing about the nature of first-person</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.510" end="00:22:50.750" style="s2">and the nature of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">between the first person and third</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.750" end="00:22:55.159" style="s2">person because a meaningful life is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:56.990" style="s2">going to involve the nature of the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.159" end="00:22:58.549" style="s2">it&#39;s also going to involve the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.990" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">my experience and it&#39;s going to involve</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.549" end="00:23:03.740" style="s2">the relationship between me in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:05.690" style="s2">right well that&#39;s at least three</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.740" end="00:23:07.669" style="s2">different ontological categories third</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.690" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">person first person and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.669" end="00:23:12.230" style="s2">between the two which is neither</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:14.419" style="s2">third-person nor first-person so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.230" end="00:23:16.580" style="s2">requires a more robust philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.419" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">includes but transcends the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.580" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">of science</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.020" end="00:23:25.909" style="s2">so let&#39;s say we just look at a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.049" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">scientific story we can frame this lots</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.909" end="00:23:31.310" style="s2">of different ways there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.940" end="00:23:33.530" style="s2">people have</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.310" end="00:23:36.350" style="s2">made a universe story based on a limited</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.530" end="00:23:38.360" style="s2">part of science and then kind of made a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.350" end="00:23:39.950" style="s2">metaphysical story related to it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.360" end="00:23:41.930" style="s2">they&#39;ll take the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.950" end="00:23:44.660" style="s2">thermodynamics increasing entropy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.930" end="00:23:46.100" style="s2">say okay so there&#39;s a lot of energy at</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.660" end="00:23:47.690" style="s2">the Big Bang and basically the universe</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.100" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">is running down and will eventually turn</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.690" end="00:23:56.030" style="s2">into just a cold vacuum and die in a a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">big freeze kind of heat death and so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.030" end="00:24:00.050" style="s2">metaphysics of universe is just as very</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:05.390" style="s2">slow inexorable march towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.050" end="00:24:08.120" style="s2">nothingness now if all there was of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.390" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">science was the second law you might do</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.120" end="00:24:13.370" style="s2">that that&#39;s obviously pretty silly and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.370" end="00:24:21.070" style="s2">explained by that at all and people will</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:23.510" style="s2">take evolutionary biology and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.070" end="00:24:25.250" style="s2">make a metaphysical answer that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.510" end="00:24:27.230" style="s2">about becoming apex predators and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.250" end="00:24:29.870" style="s2">dog-eat-dog kind of stuff and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.230" end="00:24:32.180" style="s2">right that&#39;s actually an important one</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.870" end="00:24:38.270" style="s2">to address because it&#39;s a still very</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.180" end="00:24:43.400" style="s2">pernicious worldview nature&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.270" end="00:24:44.660" style="s2">just cruel and optimizing it mmm anyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.400" end="00:24:46.310" style="s2">who spent time in nature and watched</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.660" end="00:24:52.390" style="s2">predation knows that it&#39;s pretty fucking</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.310" end="00:24:55.610" style="s2">cruel and the things that are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.390" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">fittest and the fittest can involve</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.610" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">effective cruelty survive and so humans</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.150" end="00:25:26.780" style="s2">dying and giving cold is actually what</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.010" end="00:26:01.640" style="s2">a very classic very narrow eye idea that</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.100" end="00:26:20.650" style="s2">basically justify shit that was that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.680" end="00:26:28.100" style="s2">they wanted to do I won&#39;t say the name</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.020" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">world and and they said you know either</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">like basically apex predators define the</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.520" end="00:26:56.330" style="s2">else is but the apex predators are gonna</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.380" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">and predators don&#39;t feel bad when they</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.190" end="00:27:26.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t run the world and the of the</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.760" end="00:31:01.720" style="s2">thing I&#39;d like people to understand in</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.540" end="00:31:06.900" style="s2">orcas an apex predator right killer</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.720" end="00:31:10.030" style="s2">whale top predator in their environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.900" end="00:31:11.290" style="s2">or polar bear or a tiger pick you right</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.030" end="00:31:14.679" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of apex predators we could</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.290" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">pick but an orca is like the biggest one</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.679" end="00:31:20.770" style="s2">you can think of so they&#39;re they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">good example an orca can catch one fish</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.770" end="00:31:25.000" style="s2">at a time right it&#39;s gonna go catch one</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:32.200" style="s2">tuna and it&#39;s gonna miss most of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.000" end="00:31:35.070" style="s2">time or one seal it can&#39;t it can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.200" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">a mile long drift net and pull up a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.070" end="00:31:41.800" style="s2">hundred thousand tuna at once which we</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:45.550" style="s2">can now with with industrialized dredge</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.800" end="00:31:48.340" style="s2">net kind of fishing that that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.550" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">power of an apex predator rate a a polar</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.340" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">bear can kill one walrus at a time and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:55.660" style="s2">it&#39;s fuckin dangerous to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:58.110" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty hard to do it can&#39;t slash</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.660" end="00:32:00.790" style="s2">and burn an acre of forest a second</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.110" end="00:32:03.610" style="s2">right or be able to do mountaintop</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.790" end="00:32:06.040" style="s2">removal mining or factory farm whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.610" end="00:32:09.400" style="s2">species of animal and hybridize new</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.040" end="00:32:11.140" style="s2">species and extinct species so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.400" end="00:32:14.730" style="s2">not the power of apex predators that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.140" end="00:32:18.550" style="s2">the power of gods were just shitty gods</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.730" end="00:32:20.230" style="s2">if we say do do apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.550" end="00:32:22.150" style="s2">have the ability to extinct whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.230" end="00:32:24.340" style="s2">species quickly and destroy whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.150" end="00:32:26.200" style="s2">ecosystems and make new ecosystems and</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.200" end="00:32:31.150" style="s2">that&#39;s if that&#39;s not something that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.010" end="00:32:34.930" style="s2">Darwinian process has anything to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.150" end="00:32:36.700" style="s2">with Frank and so you think about if a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.930" end="00:32:38.200" style="s2">if a polar bear got really pissed and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.700" end="00:32:39.910" style="s2">went on a tirade and tried to break all</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.200" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">that it could how much harm could it do</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.910" end="00:32:48.540" style="s2">compared to Trump or Putin with nukes</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:51.430" style="s2">right like compared to one f-15 it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.540" end="00:32:54.010" style="s2">so then you say well who has the ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.430" end="00:32:55.420" style="s2">to make new species and destroy species</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.010" end="00:32:56.350" style="s2">and make new environments and destroy</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.420" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">them well we&#39;ve thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.350" end="00:33:00.910" style="s2">mythopoetic Lee as the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:05.160" style="s2">gods or nature itself since we have that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.910" end="00:33:09.130" style="s2">much power we can destroy nature itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.160" end="00:33:13.240" style="s2">right and to not do that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.130" end="00:33:14.770" style="s2">safe vessels for that much power which</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.240" end="00:33:16.210" style="s2">means that if you have the power of gods</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.770" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">you have to have the love and the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.210" end="00:33:20.950" style="s2">of God&#39;s to guide it into Holden and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:23.140" style="s2">have developed in our power through</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.950" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">technology much much better than we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.140" end="00:33:28.660" style="s2">developed in our love and wisdom to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">wield that power well and we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.660" end="00:33:33.520" style="s2">wielded our power to just how do i how</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">do we use our power to beat the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:38.440" style="s2">guys and then they try to develop their</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:40.830" style="s2">power but that process multiplied by</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.440" end="00:33:43.510" style="s2">exponential tech destroys everything and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.830" end="00:33:45.370" style="s2">so we are at the brink of a phase shift</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.280" end="00:33:56.890" style="s2">actually worthy of calling civilization</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.410" end="00:34:00.700" style="s2">right that is actually civil they can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.890" end="00:34:03.670" style="s2">able to hold the power of AI and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.700" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">Internet of Things and geoengineering</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.670" end="00:34:07.720" style="s2">and bioengineering and actually not fuck</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:09.880" style="s2">everything up with that much capability</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.720" end="00:34:12.400" style="s2">there&#39;s this very deep question that say</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.880" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">as the power is getting stronger it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.400" end="00:34:18.310" style="s2">also getting more decentralized right</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:20.710" style="s2">so with CRISPR gene drives you can do</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.770" end="00:34:56.080" style="s2">destroy it would still be not that much</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.379" end="00:34:58.060" style="s2">relative to the planet and then with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.080" end="00:35:00.520" style="s2">bomb that changed like oh shit we can</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.340" end="00:35:10.840" style="s2">was the beginning of a whole new world</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.450" end="00:35:13.300" style="s2">right and how do how do we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.840" end="00:35:18.280" style="s2">having created a power that we can&#39;t use</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.890" end="00:35:31.390" style="s2">coming out of World War two was</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.119" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">basically a whole new world system where</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.390" end="00:35:35.230" style="s2">we had to have a United Nations because</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.230" end="00:35:39.369" style="s2">didn&#39;t prevent World War and we had to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.840" end="00:35:41.170" style="s2">have a world bank and we had to have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.369" end="00:35:44.740" style="s2">totally new international monetary</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.170" end="00:35:46.150" style="s2">policy and all of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.740" end="00:35:48.940" style="s2">structures emerged then and we had to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.150" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">have mutually assured destruction which</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.940" end="00:35:54.850" style="s2">emerged a little bit later to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:57.400" style="s2">that neither the US or the Soviets would</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.850" end="00:35:59.260" style="s2">ever use that power right now me assured</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.400" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">destruction was this kind of automated</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.260" end="00:36:03.730" style="s2">lockdown process that if anybody started</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:04.660" style="s2">to fire up their nuke silos that the</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.119" end="00:36:15.510" style="s2">was what saved us this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.800" end="00:36:17.070" style="s2">some had computer glitches that started</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.510" end="00:36:18.780" style="s2">to put us into launch sequence many</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.070" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">times and we only barely made it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.780" end="00:36:25.350" style="s2">largely by luck</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:27.180" style="s2">but that&#39;s where we only had two</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.350" end="00:36:30.270" style="s2">superpowers that had that totally</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.180" end="00:36:32.220" style="s2">catastrophic capability and those two</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.270" end="00:36:33.390" style="s2">could fully spy on each other to know if</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.220" end="00:36:35.460" style="s2">the other one was going to do something</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.390" end="00:36:38.760" style="s2">and you only had one kind of catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.460" end="00:36:43.500" style="s2">weapon not lots of them two superpowers</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.760" end="00:36:46.970" style="s2">one kind of catastrophe weapon and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.500" end="00:36:50.700" style="s2">meat you assured destruction worked and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.970" end="00:36:51.960" style="s2">we we also wore when we start running</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.700" end="00:36:53.580" style="s2">out of resources and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.960" end="00:36:55.050" style="s2">competing for the same resources because</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.580" end="00:36:56.700" style="s2">everybody&#39;s greed wants to get more</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.050" end="00:36:57.990" style="s2">they&#39;re their own National Development</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.700" end="00:36:59.850" style="s2">interests or their personal development</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:10.890" style="s2">your less okay fuck it war right so one</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.780" end="00:37:12.840" style="s2">of the other things that happened was</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.890" end="00:37:14.130" style="s2">creating this kind of monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.840" end="00:37:16.910" style="s2">coming out of World War two or we could</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.130" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">just make up shit tons of new money and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.910" end="00:37:24.180" style="s2">debt based finance and be able to create</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">this globalism and just create so much</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.180" end="00:37:28.470" style="s2">physical abundance of wealth that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:31.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to war right everybody could</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.470" end="00:37:34.200" style="s2">be getting richer simultaneously that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.410" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">was the idea it just happens whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.200" end="00:37:37.380" style="s2">you&#39;re destroying the planet very</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.900" style="s2">rapidly doing that by basically taking</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.380" end="00:37:45.570" style="s2">all of nature and turning into trash</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.900" end="00:37:47.160" style="s2">right which it is taking ecosystems that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.570" end="00:37:49.770" style="s2">took billions of years to develop and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.160" end="00:37:51.180" style="s2">Unruh new ibly destroying them on one</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.770" end="00:37:52.740" style="s2">side and then turning them into</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.180" end="00:37:54.930" style="s2">pollution on the other side after a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.740" end="00:37:56.970" style="s2">short period of use and you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.930" end="00:37:59.160" style="s2">get to keep doing that for very long on</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.970" end="00:38:00.360" style="s2">a finite planet before you destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.160" end="00:38:03.960" style="s2">planets ability to let you keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.360" end="00:38:05.220" style="s2">that and also that that based finance</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.960" end="00:38:07.650" style="s2">thing starts to catch up with you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.220" end="00:38:10.680" style="s2">because in order to pay back the debt</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.650" end="00:38:12.330" style="s2">you got to take out more debt and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.680" end="00:38:13.770" style="s2">know you get this embedded growth</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.330" end="00:38:15.390" style="s2">obligation right you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.770" end="00:38:17.130" style="s2">growing exponentially year over year</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.390" end="00:38:19.650" style="s2">just to break even because you get to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.130" end="00:38:24.119" style="s2">keep up with the interest</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.650" end="00:38:26.829" style="s2">so we get to about where we are now and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.119" end="00:38:31.660" style="s2">the Bretton Woods world has completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.829" end="00:38:36.280" style="s2">broken down because we can&#39;t keep just</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.660" end="00:38:38.829" style="s2">debt based financing rapid growth to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.280" end="00:38:41.349" style="s2">prevent conflict because we already have</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.829" end="00:38:44.319" style="s2">more of our total GDP going to servicing</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.349" end="00:38:46.089" style="s2">the debt than is sustainable and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.319" end="00:38:48.250" style="s2">we&#39;re at the end of the financial</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.089" end="00:38:49.900" style="s2">systems ability to do that and Cova just</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.250" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2">made that worse by lowering GDP and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.900" end="00:38:56.349" style="s2">increasing debt a lot and it was already</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:58.569" style="s2">unsustainable we&#39;re near the planetary</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.349" end="00:39:01.240" style="s2">boundaries on like a hundred different</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.569" end="00:39:04.180" style="s2">boundaries and so we can&#39;t keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.240" end="00:39:09.450" style="s2">the turn nature into trash but money</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.180" end="00:39:12.220" style="s2">briefly on the way to trash process and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.450" end="00:39:15.339" style="s2">we have dozens of catastrophe weapons</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.220" end="00:39:16.690" style="s2">now not just one and nukes there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.339" end="00:39:18.520" style="s2">not that many places that have uranium</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.690" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s very hard to enrich and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.520" end="00:39:21.369" style="s2">not like a it&#39;s not like small groups</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:24.369" style="s2">can really make nukes they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.369" end="00:39:27.339" style="s2">hard to make but that&#39;s not true for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.369" end="00:39:30.130" style="s2">for weaponized drones they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.339" end="00:39:32.220" style="s2">easy to make and for a lot of other neat</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.130" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">types of exponential tech that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.220" end="00:39:36.700" style="s2">relatively small forces not even state</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.470" style="s2">actors can make plus there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.700" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">state actors that have new nukes now and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.470" end="00:39:41.829" style="s2">chemical weapons in bio weapons and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">other things like that so now you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.829" end="00:39:47.079" style="s2">a world where you&#39;ve got not two actors</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:49.020" style="s2">but lots of actors more than we can even</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.079" end="00:39:52.059" style="s2">identify ones that we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.020" end="00:39:54.069" style="s2">who can have catastrophe weapons and not</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.059" end="00:39:56.559" style="s2">one type of catastrophe weapon but lots</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.069" end="00:39:59.500" style="s2">of them where you don&#39;t have clear</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.559" end="00:40:01.930" style="s2">counters for them and you&#39;re near the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.500" end="00:40:03.910" style="s2">planetary boundaries environmentally and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.930" end="00:40:05.859" style="s2">you&#39;re at the end of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.910" end="00:40:08.020" style="s2">systems capability to keep doing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.859" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">thing it&#39;s done that&#39;s a transition</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.020" end="00:40:19.240" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:21.490" style="s2">and it&#39;s just I don&#39;t remember exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.240" end="00:40:27.310" style="s2">how we got here but important in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.490" end="00:40:29.020" style="s2">understanding this to say that the B oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.310" end="00:40:33.369" style="s2">I was talking about the apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.020" end="00:40:39.460" style="s2">model so that even before we had nukes</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.369" end="00:40:42.940" style="s2">an apex predator couldn&#39;t doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.460" end="00:40:44.920" style="s2">something like a city</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.940" end="00:40:46.869" style="s2">which is a completely altered</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.920" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">environment and we&#39;ve been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.869" end="00:40:51.369" style="s2">for thousands of years but and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:53.500" style="s2">been using that increased power</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.369" end="00:40:56.680" style="s2">destructively and driving this arms race</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.500" end="00:40:58.810" style="s2">of increasing destructive capacity but</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.680" end="00:41:01.770" style="s2">at a certain point it became globally</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.810" end="00:41:04.690" style="s2">catastrophic destruction and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.770" end="00:41:07.210" style="s2">many many different methods of globally</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.690" end="00:41:14.109" style="s2">catastrophic destruction initiate able</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.210" end="00:41:15.670" style="s2">by many many actors and so this is now</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.109" end="00:41:17.290" style="s2">we&#39;re like oh this is what the power of</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.670" end="00:41:22.180" style="s2">gods without the love or wisdom to guide</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.290" end="00:41:23.890" style="s2">it looks like and so you could ask this</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.180" end="00:41:26.020" style="s2">question as exponential tech continues</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.890" end="00:41:27.670" style="s2">and we get more power that becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.020" end="00:41:29.410" style="s2">decentralized oh yeah it said all that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.670" end="00:41:30.910" style="s2">same nukes are pretty centralized but</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.410" end="00:41:33.960" style="s2">the new tech is decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.910" end="00:41:33.960" style="s2">but catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.280" end="00:41:42.750" style="s2">how do we make a civilization that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.410" end="00:41:46.250" style="s2">anti fragile with with decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.750" end="00:41:46.250" style="s2">exponential technology</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:51.420" style="s2">which means if I&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.810" end="00:41:54.450" style="s2">non-state actors that can make</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.420" end="00:41:57.450" style="s2">catastrophe weapons and I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.450" end="00:42:00.270" style="s2">know who they are how do we make a world</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.450" end="00:42:02.370" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t break given the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.270" end="00:42:04.650" style="s2">humans have historically used power how</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.370" end="00:42:07.910" style="s2">do we make a world where anybody can</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.820" end="00:42:12.780" style="s2">interesting question it&#39;s a very</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.920" end="00:44:09.030" style="s2">you have as a surplus you use to help</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.630" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">others sort their shit that&#39;s how I saw</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.030" end="00:44:15.870" style="s2">that and I wonder whether that&#39;s naivety</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.930" style="s2">ignorance probably definitely a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.870" end="00:44:20.790" style="s2">ignorance I&#39;ve never been exposed to</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.050" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">have that that mindset so probably some</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.660" end="00:44:35.390" style="s2">ignorance there that I just haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">this firsthand and it just sounds like a</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:42.830" style="s2">right it just Suns totally detached from</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.660" end="00:44:52.330" style="s2">no these are actual people and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.530" end="00:44:57.080" style="s2">wonder I wonder how much of it is um I</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.330" end="00:44:59.090" style="s2">wonder how much introspective work self</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.080" end="00:45:00.830" style="s2">development working out what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.090" end="00:45:02.810" style="s2">to want what should I want to want what</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.830" end="00:45:04.340" style="s2">is genuinely good for me and then how</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.810" end="00:45:08.030" style="s2">can I make what is good for me be good</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.340" end="00:45:10.340" style="s2">for others I wonder how much of that can</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.030" end="00:45:13.850" style="s2">be the answer to some of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.340" end="00:45:16.550" style="s2">challenges that we face and where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.850" end="00:45:22.100" style="s2">upper bound to what that can achieve is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.550" end="00:45:25.990" style="s2">a body isn&#39;t just 70 or 90 trillion</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.100" end="00:45:25.990" style="s2">healthy cells all doing their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.250" end="00:45:33.010" style="s2">that would just be a pile of goo right</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.620" end="00:45:35.530" style="s2">they&#39;ll just be bio protoplasm the body</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.010" end="00:45:37.900" style="s2">is actually a coordination between those</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.530" end="00:45:39.310" style="s2">it involves not just how they function</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.900" end="00:45:40.600" style="s2">individually in a petri dish but how</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.310" end="00:45:42.220" style="s2">they relate with each other to be able</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.600" end="00:45:45.420" style="s2">to make tissues and organs and organ</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.220" end="00:45:50.020" style="s2">systems and that whole thing right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.420" end="00:45:51.400" style="s2">so a cell needs to do what it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.020" end="00:45:52.690" style="s2">do to be a healthy cell but it also</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.400" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">needs to communicate with all the ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.690" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">around it to mediate what the tissue</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:59.920" style="s2">needs to do and what it&#39;s because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:01.480" style="s2">can&#39;t just be doing its own thing when</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.920" end="00:46:02.920" style="s2">the muscle needs to flex that particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.480" end="00:46:06.910" style="s2">muscle cell has to be engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.920" end="00:46:08.200" style="s2">process right and let&#39;s say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.910" end="00:46:11.050" style="s2">being a good healthy cell but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.200" end="00:46:13.290" style="s2">cancer cell nearby if some cells don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.050" end="00:46:16.780" style="s2">actually take that cancer cell out it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.290" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">replicate and kill the whole body and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.780" end="00:46:20.710" style="s2">there is a need to be a healthy cell</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">there&#39;s also a need to coordinate with</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.710" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">those around you for the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.320" style="s2">need to happen there&#39;s also a need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:27.730" style="s2">have an immune function when there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.320" end="00:46:29.600" style="s2">things happening that damage the health</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.730" end="00:46:32.660" style="s2">of the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.600" end="00:46:33.980" style="s2">and so if we&#39;re talking about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:35.240" style="s2">want to develop people we want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.980" end="00:46:37.510" style="s2">develop people in all three of those</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.240" end="00:46:37.510" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">they want to be they want to have as</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.180" end="00:46:44.259" style="s2">much capacity to do the things that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:46.930" style="s2">should do individually they want to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.259" end="00:46:49.750" style="s2">the capacity to synergize to to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.930" end="00:46:51.849" style="s2">synergy with the people that are around</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.750" end="00:46:54.579" style="s2">them and that they can access now</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.849" end="00:46:57.700" style="s2">increasingly access I guess with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.579" end="00:47:01.740" style="s2">tools that we have the immune function I</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:06.700" style="s2">can&#39;t explain how does that manifest</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.740" end="00:47:10.690" style="s2">that law is that just police what if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.700" end="00:47:13.569" style="s2">see harm happening do you stop it do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.690" end="00:47:15.250" style="s2">do something to correct the to correct</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.569" end="00:47:17.710" style="s2">to harm and correct the sources of harm</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.250" end="00:47:21.160" style="s2">who does right how does that differ from</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.710" end="00:47:24.089" style="s2">synergy is it because the actor is</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.160" end="00:47:26.829" style="s2">malignant as opposed to compliant or</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.089" end="00:47:29.579" style="s2">cooperative well they&#39;re within a</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.829" end="00:47:29.579" style="s2">spectrum right</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.010" end="00:47:37.250" style="s2">actually very interesting in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.490" end="00:47:39.970" style="s2">cancer because cancer isn&#39;t some</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.250" end="00:47:42.260" style="s2">external pathogen it&#39;s a cell that</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.970" end="00:47:43.790" style="s2">mutated in a way that stops doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.260" end="00:47:46.430" style="s2">synergy with the other cells around it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.790" end="00:47:47.240" style="s2">right and because it&#39;s genetic code is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.430" end="00:47:48.860" style="s2">altered where it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.240" end="00:47:51.470" style="s2">identify with the rest of the whole in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.860" end="00:47:54.320" style="s2">the same way and so it doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.470" end="00:47:56.120" style="s2">sacrifice its own maximum consumption of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.320" end="00:47:57.560" style="s2">sugar and reproduction rate to synergize</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.120" end="00:48:00.410" style="s2">with everything it&#39;s like fuck it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.560" end="00:48:03.260" style="s2">just going to consume and replicate as</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.410" end="00:48:04.970" style="s2">fast as I can which not which is like</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.260" end="00:48:06.350" style="s2">really good for it for a short while but</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.970" end="00:48:07.880" style="s2">it ends up killing itself when it kills</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.350" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">the host which is what humans are doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:11.000" style="s2">with regard to the planet and also our</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:12.830" style="s2">relationships with each other where you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.000" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">do that with someone else and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.830" end="00:48:16.900" style="s2">engenders enmity and war back and things</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:16.900" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.570" end="00:48:22.620" style="s2">the bodies there&#39;s oxidative stress and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:24.930" style="s2">free radicals that are making cancer all</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.620" end="00:48:28.230" style="s2">the time it&#39;s just it&#39;s also getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:29.850" style="s2">addressed so the first stage of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.230" end="00:48:31.980" style="s2">with cancer in a healthy body is just</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.850" end="00:48:33.390" style="s2">not having that much carcinogenesis to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.980" end="00:48:36.120" style="s2">begin with right that the body is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.390" end="00:48:38.970" style="s2">actually doing a good job of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.120" end="00:48:40.530" style="s2">with carcinogenic factors radicals and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.970" end="00:48:44.550" style="s2">oxidants and like that so cells aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.530" end="00:48:46.500" style="s2">turning cancerous that often if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.550" end="00:48:48.120" style="s2">too much carcinogenesis and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.500" end="00:48:49.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t want exposed to carcinogenic</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.120" end="00:48:52.350" style="s2">compounds right if there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.980" end="00:48:54.210" style="s2">carcinogenesis it&#39;ll overload the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.350" end="00:48:55.640" style="s2">ability to deal with cancerous cells and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.210" end="00:48:58.200" style="s2">then you&#39;ll start to get a proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">so this is the preventative side how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.200" end="00:49:02.520" style="s2">we have people not become cancer cells</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:04.710" style="s2">in the first place how do we not deal</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.520" end="00:49:06.900" style="s2">with it on the prison or judicial side</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.710" end="00:49:08.840" style="s2">later but on how do we develop humans</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.900" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">that are psychologically healthy and if</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.840" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">psychologically healthy also means are</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:16.760" style="s2">part of a whole so they behave in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.510" end="00:49:16.760" style="s2">that works well for them mo right</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.900" end="00:49:21.309" style="s2">then the next step is if a cell starts</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:23.799" style="s2">to get damaged some oxidative damage</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.309" end="00:49:25.329" style="s2">happens to it it trapped the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.799" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">body tries to heal it first</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.329" end="00:49:30.490" style="s2">can we actually bring antioxidants and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:32.829" style="s2">correct that process if that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.490" end="00:49:35.170" style="s2">happen then the body has to kill it if</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.829" end="00:49:38.170" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t happen then it&#39;ll replicate</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.170" end="00:49:40.930" style="s2">and usually kill the body so when we</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.170" end="00:49:42.220" style="s2">start to think about the staging of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.930" end="00:49:45.609" style="s2">immune function and what that represents</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.480" end="00:51:39.140" style="s2">job of the police to stop that because</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.100" end="00:51:41.360" style="s2">it&#39;s granted by law that that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.140" end="00:51:43.460" style="s2">but it&#39;s not right law right law</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.360" end="00:51:45.140" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t allow a factory farm you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.460" end="00:51:49.580" style="s2">or those other things to occur so didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.140" end="00:51:52.070" style="s2">we have to say so do i what is mine to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.580" end="00:51:54.200" style="s2">do to actually see the injustice isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.750" end="00:52:00.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a also important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.980" end="00:52:04.010" style="s2">question very symbolic I like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.320" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">analogy to the cancer cells I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.010" end="00:52:10.040" style="s2">back two years ago to an episode I did</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:13.970" style="s2">with Cory Alan meditation teacher and he</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.040" end="00:52:15.620" style="s2">had this analogy way he thinks when</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.970" end="00:52:18.140" style="s2">someone gets angry with him as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.620" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">conversation Oh someone cuts him off in</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.140" end="00:52:20.930" style="s2">traffic or or something happens that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:23.530" style="s2">cuts in line at the checkout and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.930" end="00:52:29.020" style="s2">and then you can see they&#39;re itching for</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.530" end="00:52:32.060" style="s2">event and he he treats that anger like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.020" end="00:52:35.150" style="s2">pathogen like a flu virus and what he</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.060" end="00:52:36.110" style="s2">thinks in his mind is I wonder where</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.150" end="00:52:39.080" style="s2">that came from</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.110" end="00:52:41.420" style="s2">like I wonder what the heritage of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.080" end="00:52:43.250" style="s2">anger is like who passed it on to you</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.420" end="00:52:44.780" style="s2">then who passed it on to them then who</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.250" end="00:52:47.210" style="s2">passed it on to them then where did that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.780" end="00:52:50.720" style="s2">emerge from and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.210" end="00:52:54.230" style="s2">interconnectedness right yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:56.090" style="s2">interconnectedness it&#39;s a it&#39;s a basis</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.230" end="00:52:58.250" style="s2">for compassion and understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.090" end="00:53:00.600" style="s2">it&#39;s also an immune function to keep</p>

<p begin="00:53:00.600" end="00:53:03.660" style="s2">because if you get pissed off back at</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.130" end="00:53:05.250" style="s2">them and you understand it as a pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.660" end="00:53:06.630" style="s2">you&#39;ll realize that you actually just</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.250" end="00:53:07.350" style="s2">lost your sovereignty and just got</p>

<p begin="00:53:07.350" end="00:53:11.700" style="s2">and if you see that as you know I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:53:41.580" end="00:53:46.220" style="s2">in the system I guess you could say it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.990" end="00:53:49.050" style="s2">as is that a way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.220" end="00:53:52.350" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a fine point of</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.080" end="01:04:19.390" style="s2">of everything which is just actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.230" end="01:04:19.390" style="s2">silly right</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.010" end="01:04:28.940" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that purpose is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.180" end="01:04:33.020" style="s2">utilitarian concept the purpose of X is</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.940" end="01:04:35.420" style="s2">y the purpose of my job is I do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.020" end="01:04:37.100" style="s2">function at the business well if I if</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.420" end="01:04:38.600" style="s2">okay I do the marketing of the business</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.100" end="01:04:40.610" style="s2">or the accounting or whatever it is well</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.600" end="01:04:43.400" style="s2">if I assume the business existing</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.610" end="01:04:44.360" style="s2">matters I then it makes sense why me</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.400" end="01:04:46.550" style="s2">doing that thing matters if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.360" end="01:04:49.790" style="s2">utilitarian right assuming the value of</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.550" end="01:04:53.330" style="s2">y then I can say X relative to it but</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.790" end="01:04:55.880" style="s2">purpose is always extrinsic relational</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.330" end="01:04:57.680" style="s2">utilitarian so if I say what is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.880" end="01:04:59.630" style="s2">purpose of all of reality what is there</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.680" end="01:05:07.510" style="s2">outside of reality to ground that in</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.630" end="01:05:09.490" style="s2">reference to so it&#39;s just actually ill</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.510" end="01:05:16.870" style="s2">question because purpose is a smaller</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.490" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">concept in reality is so yes reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.870" end="01:05:20.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a purpose in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.400" end="01:05:21.700" style="s2">anything within reality does but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.260" end="01:05:22.600" style="s2">also not purposeless</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.700" end="01:05:24.340" style="s2">in the way that we think of</p>

<p begin="01:06:02.520" end="01:06:10.570" style="s2">does that not mean that seeking those</p>

<p begin="01:08:33.580" end="01:08:37.330" style="s2">sounds so stupid you know especially if</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.440" end="01:08:39.130" style="s2">you grew up with that five brothers and</p>

<p begin="01:08:48.220" end="01:08:55.930" style="s2">it was very much a single focused lack</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.440" end="01:09:09.730" style="s2">blinkers on and um yeah man like so this</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.960" end="01:09:14.190" style="s2">answers the question you were starting</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.730" end="01:09:18.370" style="s2">to ask right about pursuing a state okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.190" end="01:09:23.070" style="s2">that can be done narcissistically and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.370" end="01:09:23.070" style="s2">won&#39;t produce a meaningful life why</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.980" end="01:09:37.310" style="s2">so you run a thought experiment</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.990" end="01:09:43.340" style="s2">everybody in the world does that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.310" end="01:09:45.620" style="s2">you&#39;re here by yourself but you can have</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.340" end="01:09:48.470" style="s2">like a fighter jet and Lamborghinis and</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.470" end="01:09:55.190" style="s2">just nobody else here most people when</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.780" end="01:09:58.730" style="s2">they take time to really run through</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.190" end="01:10:01.070" style="s2">that scenario try to figure out how to</p>

<p begin="01:10:01.070" end="01:10:09.890" style="s2">for a while and then fundamentally can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.730" end="01:10:12.950" style="s2">find meaningfulness in it and to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.890" end="01:10:14.960" style="s2">extent they can it&#39;s because they have</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.950" end="01:10:16.760" style="s2">the idea of a god which is still a being</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.960" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">they&#39;re relating with or they get really</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.760" end="01:10:21.740" style="s2">friendly with animals but ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:23.300" style="s2">consciousness wants to be in</p>

<p begin="01:10:28.100" end="01:10:32.270" style="s2">fundamental to consciousness or do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.350" end="01:10:34.340" style="s2">think that that&#39;s embedded due to these</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.270" end="01:10:37.540" style="s2">social animals that we are and that</p>

<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:47.670" style="s2">both interesting can you can you talk me</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.530" end="01:10:52.469" style="s2">through your thinking with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.670" end="01:10:54.449" style="s2">how its fundamental to consciousness so</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.469" end="01:10:59.370" style="s2">we think of consciousness associated</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.449" end="01:11:04.110" style="s2">with an organism like a person maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.370" end="01:11:06.120" style="s2">dog whatever right and we think of them</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.110" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">having some kind of separate</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.120" end="01:11:11.550" style="s2">consciousness associated with that brain</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:14.370" style="s2">in that body container and so the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.550" end="01:11:16.199" style="s2">consciousness is just is the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.370" end="01:11:19.530" style="s2">property of their brain or dwells in it</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.199" end="01:11:26.030" style="s2">or something like that this is this is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.530" end="01:11:29.159" style="s2">really deeply flawed concept because</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.030" end="01:11:31.710" style="s2">inside of my body brain package that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.159" end="01:11:36.870" style="s2">call I physically that I think my</p>

<p begin="01:11:36.870" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">include all of the coral reef and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.449" end="01:11:45.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t include all of the plants and</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.949" end="01:11:48.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t include the soil microbiome I</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.870" end="01:11:51.590" style="s2">don&#39;t think of those as I but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.510" end="01:11:51.590" style="s2">exist without all of them</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.110" end="01:11:56.470" style="s2">so can I say that my consciousness is an</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.730" end="01:11:57.970" style="s2">emergent property of this thing without</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.470" end="01:12:00.250" style="s2">saying it&#39;s an emergent property of all</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.970" end="01:12:03.200" style="s2">of that because this thing is an</p>

<p begin="01:12:03.200" end="01:12:09.010" style="s2">and so without the plants I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.260" end="01:12:09.010" style="s2">an idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.469" end="01:12:12.409" style="s2">there isn&#39;t even a well-formed concept</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.179" end="01:12:17.510" style="s2">of me that exists without an atmosphere</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.409" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">and oxygen and without the Sun and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.510" end="01:12:21.650" style="s2">without the other planets that keep the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:23.599" style="s2">asteroids from hitting us and without it</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.650" end="01:12:26.749" style="s2">just keep going on and we find the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.599" end="01:12:28.639" style="s2">entire universe is configured in a way</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.749" end="01:12:32.300" style="s2">that I&#39;m the emergent property of a part</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.639" end="01:12:33.739" style="s2">of it and you take away the galactic</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.300" end="01:12:34.880" style="s2">center you take away the Sun you take</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.739" end="01:12:35.960" style="s2">away the other planets you take away the</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.909" end="01:12:40.599" style="s2">and I don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.489" end="01:12:57.409" style="s2">so my consciousness is not an emergent</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.199" end="01:12:59.420" style="s2">property so imagine putting me in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.409" end="01:13:00.860" style="s2">complete and perfect vacuum and just</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.420" end="01:13:04.849" style="s2">imagine I didn&#39;t physically die for a</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.860" end="01:13:07.130" style="s2">moment which I of course would what</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.849" end="01:13:08.780" style="s2">would the sensory experience be there&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.130" end="01:13:10.610" style="s2">be no sensory input what would the</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.780" end="01:13:14.360" style="s2">contents of consciousness with no</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.610" end="01:13:16.969" style="s2">sensory input be I think in words that</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.360" end="01:13:18.739" style="s2">were developed by other people I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.969" end="01:13:21.340" style="s2">in images that were created by other</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.739" end="01:13:21.340" style="s2">people ie</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.639" end="01:13:31.699" style="s2">all of the contents of my consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.860" end="01:13:33.980" style="s2">came from the world so the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.699" end="01:13:38.420" style="s2">it&#39;s my consciousness is just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.980" end="01:13:39.650" style="s2">sloppy thinking and a misnomer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.420" end="01:13:43.550" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.650" end="01:13:46.340" style="s2">the fact that you are the tip of the</p>

<p begin="01:13:53.059" end="01:14:04.389" style="s2">continues to permit you to be yeah turn</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.670" end="01:14:04.389" style="s2">the Sun off by yeah we were touching on</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.929" end="01:14:10.190" style="s2">being present as being the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:12.670" style="s2">you are to chase in order to discover</p>

<p begin="01:14:12.670" end="01:14:17.599" style="s2">purely the thing that you should you</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.889" end="01:14:20.090" style="s2">should seek and I think that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.599" end="01:14:22.159" style="s2">mentioned about narcissism and the fact</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.090" end="01:14:28.420" style="s2">that there&#39;s an interconnectedness with</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.159" end="01:14:28.420" style="s2">other people whether I am</p>

<p begin="01:14:59.000" end="01:15:02.710" style="s2">the world a particular way for me to</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.440" end="01:15:02.710" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.639" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.189" end="01:15:17.429" style="s2">I remember the saying</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.460" end="01:15:22.260" style="s2">the Bible or the Tao Te Ching all of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.250" end="01:15:23.700" style="s2">various wisdom traditions were</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.260" end="01:15:26.850" style="s2">interesting to me growing up so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.700" end="01:15:29.210" style="s2">saying this in a way that people have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.850" end="01:15:35.190" style="s2">accept that book as anything other than</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.210" end="01:15:37.980" style="s2">interesting remember there was a quote</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.190" end="01:15:42.210" style="s2">in Luke attributed to Jesus that really</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.980" end="01:15:44.640" style="s2">bothered me as a kid and I came to</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.210" end="01:15:46.320" style="s2">understand the really profound wisdom in</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.640" end="01:15:48.150" style="s2">it after contemplating him for a long</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.320" end="01:15:51.660" style="s2">time and I may be obvious for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.150" end="01:15:54.239" style="s2">people said to those who have more shall</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.660" end="01:15:56.390" style="s2">be given and to those who don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.239" end="01:15:59.790" style="s2">little they have will be taken away and</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.390" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">it really deeply bothered because of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.790" end="01:16:02.940" style="s2">context of it being in the Bible and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:04.440" style="s2">something that someone like Jesus would</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.940" end="01:16:06.960" style="s2">say that I wanted to be Robin hood-like</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.440" end="01:16:09.950" style="s2">and say like no no well well we&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.960" end="01:16:09.950" style="s2">to those who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.719" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">and we can see where this is true just</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.170" end="01:16:17.500" style="s2">in terms of like if you have debt you</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:19.330" style="s2">get compounding interest in debt and if</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.500" end="01:16:20.739" style="s2">you have savings you get compounding</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.330" end="01:16:21.910" style="s2">interest in savings to those who have</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.739" end="01:16:23.949" style="s2">more as given to those who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.910" end="01:16:25.719" style="s2">the little they have is taken away it it</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.949" end="01:16:30.219" style="s2">just ends up being something that shows</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.719" end="01:16:33.280" style="s2">up as true in lots of places when</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.219" end="01:16:34.860" style="s2">someone is in a state of not having</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.280" end="01:16:37.210" style="s2">around relationships and they feel</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.860" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">lonely and upset with people and</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.210" end="01:16:42.010" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re not maximally</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:43.180" style="s2">attractive as a person in that state</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.010" end="01:16:45.100" style="s2">right when someone&#39;s in the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.180" end="01:16:45.969" style="s2">abundance of their relationships they</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.100" end="01:16:49.050" style="s2">show up in a way that&#39;s more attractive</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.969" end="01:16:51.130" style="s2">to those who have more it&#39;s given</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.050" end="01:16:53.730" style="s2">ultimately they have and not have our</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.130" end="01:16:53.730" style="s2">states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.280" end="01:17:01.809" style="s2">and so there is a place where I feel</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.630" end="01:17:04.780" style="s2">like I don&#39;t have enough and I&#39;m some</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.809" end="01:17:07.380" style="s2">kind of empty needy thing that needs to</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.780" end="01:17:09.940" style="s2">get mine from the world whatever that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.380" end="01:17:11.229" style="s2">more acknowledgement more money more</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.940" end="01:17:17.110" style="s2">muscle more knowledge more something</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.229" end="01:17:19.239" style="s2">more good state through meditation but</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.110" end="01:17:21.400" style="s2">I&#39;m still basically coming from some</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.239" end="01:17:30.010" style="s2">kind of lack and what what&#39;s in it for</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.400" end="01:17:35.320" style="s2">me I think okay so growth can happen in</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.010" end="01:17:38.999" style="s2">that place but there is a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.320" end="01:17:38.999" style="s2">place for that concert to shift</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.340" end="01:17:52.330" style="s2">where I stop thinking I need anything</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.340" end="01:17:52.330" style="s2">from the world in particular</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.350" end="01:17:58.500" style="s2">and there is a felt sense of connection</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.550" end="01:18:02.100" style="s2">to life that has a fullness indwelling</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.500" end="01:18:03.840" style="s2">within it and then what what do I get</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.100" end="01:18:07.680" style="s2">out of life stops being the relevant</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.840" end="01:18:09.990" style="s2">question and how do I pursue a</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.680" end="01:18:15.750" style="s2">particular state stops becoming the</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.990" end="01:18:17.880" style="s2">relevant question and are there other</p>

<p begin="01:18:17.880" end="01:18:21.600" style="s2">how to shift it that I can do something</p>

<p begin="01:18:24.600" end="01:18:30.920" style="s2">more interesting question and I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.030" end="01:18:30.920" style="s2">life kind of starts there</p>

<p begin="01:20:33.320" end="01:20:43.260" style="s2">yeah if you consistently connected with</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.140" end="01:20:45.570" style="s2">the people that were around you and felt</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.260" end="01:20:48.090" style="s2">like you were contributing to something</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.570" end="01:20:49.560" style="s2">that you genuinely care about and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.090" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">progressing and we&#39;re still satisfying</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.560" end="01:20:55.170" style="s2">that airy review that wants to feel like</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:56.040" style="s2">growth like everything else I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.170" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">would fall into place</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.040" end="01:21:08.690" style="s2">and the beauty of the extraordinary in</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:11.370" style="s2">the ordinary is is something hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.690" end="01:21:13.170" style="s2">that as people develop themselves they</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.370" end="01:21:15.540" style="s2">start to strip away the things that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.170" end="01:21:18.510" style="s2">think that they need and are left with</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.540" end="01:21:20.280" style="s2">with something which is more more simple</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.510" end="01:21:22.980" style="s2">and more pure and I loved at the start I</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.280" end="01:21:24.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t bring it up but as you</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.980" end="01:21:27.720" style="s2">mentioned about sort of the tier 1 tier</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.600" end="01:21:30.450" style="s2">2 tier 3 of self development that really</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.720" end="01:21:32.340" style="s2">struck me about His Dark Materials which</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.450" end="01:21:34.680" style="s2">is a children&#39;s trilogy by Philip</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.340" end="01:21:37.560" style="s2">Pullman and in it there&#39;s a girl called</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.680" end="01:21:38.760" style="s2">Lyra Belacqua gets the name Lyra silver</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.560" end="01:21:40.740" style="s2">tongue halfway through you can tell her</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.760" end="01:21:44.250" style="s2">I listen to it and read it a lot as a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.740" end="01:21:46.770" style="s2">kid and um she&#39;s given this</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.250" end="01:21:49.970" style="s2">truth-telling device called an early</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.770" end="01:21:53.130" style="s2">Theo meter and she&#39;s given it and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.970" end="01:21:55.590" style="s2">nuns in the Oxford of the Universe that</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.130" end="01:21:58.560" style="s2">she lives in it&#39;s a multiverse story</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.590" end="01:22:02.340" style="s2">then the nuns of the the University that</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.560" end="01:22:03.600" style="s2">she lives in tell her this story about</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.340" end="01:22:05.640" style="s2">how people need to study for their</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.600" end="01:22:08.400" style="s2">entire lives I have to study for my</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.640" end="01:22:10.530" style="s2">entire life but the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:12.750" style="s2">these devices have to study the books</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.530" end="01:22:13.950" style="s2">and eBooks arcane texts they have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.750" end="01:22:15.750" style="s2">understand all of these different things</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.950" end="01:22:18.690" style="s2">and then they can read them and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.750" end="01:22:20.610" style="s2">she&#39;s given one in secret and it turns</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.690" end="01:22:22.860" style="s2">out that she can read it</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.610" end="01:22:24.840" style="s2">she&#39;s never learned to she can read it</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.860" end="01:22:27.370" style="s2">so she has natural grace</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.840" end="01:22:30.190" style="s2">she has unconscious competence</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.370" end="01:22:32.860" style="s2">and she&#39;s able to read it which he could</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.190" end="01:22:34.740" style="s2">draw an analogy to experiencing life the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.860" end="01:22:37.720" style="s2">purity of experiencing life as a child</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.740" end="01:22:39.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a lucuma song which opens up at</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.720" end="01:22:42.010" style="s2">17 you don&#39;t think that much about life</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.670" end="01:22:44.920" style="s2">you just live it and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.010" end="01:22:48.070" style="s2">same then she hits puberty and as she</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.920" end="01:22:50.320" style="s2">hits puberty she loses the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.070" end="01:22:53.380" style="s2">read this truth-telling device</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.320" end="01:22:55.720" style="s2">she loses that conscious on competence</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.380" end="01:23:00.010" style="s2">she becomes aware it&#39;s the fall from</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.720" end="01:23:02.110" style="s2">grace it&#39;s and then there&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.010" end="01:23:04.000" style="s2">tiny little passage towards the end of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.110" end="01:23:06.550" style="s2">the book and she&#39;s speaking to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.000" end="01:23:08.440" style="s2">another one of the nuns about how am I</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.550" end="01:23:10.870" style="s2">going to get the ability to tell the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.440" end="01:23:13.510" style="s2">truth back from from my device from the</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.870" end="01:23:17.320" style="s2">Alethea meter and she says my dear child</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.510" end="01:23:19.420" style="s2">it will take you a lifetime of study but</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.320" end="01:23:21.340" style="s2">the depth of your understanding will be</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.420" end="01:23:25.210" style="s2">deeper and greater than it ever ever was</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.340" end="01:23:29.110" style="s2">before conscious competence and I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.210" end="01:23:31.060" style="s2">that timeline Maps sort of quite nicely</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.110" end="01:23:32.680" style="s2">on to what I hope personal development</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.060" end="01:23:36.280" style="s2">self development actually ends up being</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.680" end="01:23:44.380" style="s2">for people yeah there&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.280" end="01:23:48.690" style="s2">presence that we see in children they</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.380" end="01:23:56.380" style="s2">can be overjoyed and fulfilled with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.690" end="01:23:57.880" style="s2">experience of life and this is the in no</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.380" end="01:23:59.380" style="s2">way except you turn and become like</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.880" end="01:24:10.830" style="s2">little children she pass on the kingdom</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.380" end="01:24:12.910" style="s2">pepper and to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.830" end="01:24:16.990" style="s2">connectedness with life that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.910" end="01:24:21.400" style="s2">always seeking what stimulus is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.990" end="01:24:23.710" style="s2">fulfill me next with adult capacities</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.400" end="01:24:27.460" style="s2">that can actually show up to the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.710" end="01:24:29.110" style="s2">is very interesting there was a I saw</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.460" end="01:24:31.540" style="s2">Jordan Peterson life a couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.110" end="01:24:33.400" style="s2">ago and they were reading questions out</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.540" end="01:24:35.650" style="s2">from Twitter that had been submitted</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.400" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">Dave Rubin goes up on stage and asks in</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.650" end="01:24:39.820" style="s2">these questions and one of the questions</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:41.380" style="s2">that somebody asked him was that</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.820" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">essentially boiled down to</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.380" end="01:24:45.550" style="s2">the depth of my consciousness causes me</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:47.230" style="s2">to suffer I wish that I thought less I</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.550" end="01:24:50.050" style="s2">wish that I didn&#39;t consider things so</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.230" end="01:24:51.699" style="s2">much it is both a blessing and a curse</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.050" end="01:24:54.969" style="s2">to feel thoughts of things so very</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.699" end="01:24:58.600" style="s2">deeply and Jordans answer to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.969" end="01:25:00.250" style="s2">stuck with me which was that you can try</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.600" end="01:25:01.719" style="s2">and regress back to a more animalistic</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.250" end="01:25:03.400" style="s2">more simple time which would be people</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.719" end="01:25:05.860" style="s2">looking at children and being envy of</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.400" end="01:25:08.080" style="s2">their innocence right and thinking look</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.860" end="01:25:09.790" style="s2">at how simple it is or looking at their</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.080" end="01:25:11.530" style="s2">dog and thinking look how simple it</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.790" end="01:25:14.230" style="s2">would be if I was just a dog you know I</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.530" end="01:25:16.300" style="s2">just lie in the Sun and play with balls</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.230" end="01:25:18.130" style="s2">and stuff like that but you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.300" end="01:25:20.530" style="s2">that option and Jordan gave this really</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.130" end="01:25:23.980" style="s2">symbolic answer as he often does and he</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.530" end="01:25:26.409" style="s2">said um you can take more of the poison</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.980" end="01:25:29.500" style="s2">until you girdle it into a tonic that</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.409" end="01:25:31.210" style="s2">allows you to rule your own world and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.500" end="01:25:35.500" style="s2">really like that I like the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.210" end="01:25:37.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not about escaping from Dante&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.500" end="01:25:39.250" style="s2">Inferno it&#39;s about going through every</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.090" end="01:25:41.620" style="s2">single level right to the very very</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.250" end="01:25:46.929" style="s2">bottom and that&#39;s where you then sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.620" end="01:25:49.600" style="s2">break it all open Donnie man I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.929" end="01:25:52.960" style="s2">we could go on for forever but for me</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.600" end="01:25:57.400" style="s2">it&#39;s 11:00 a.m. and for you it&#39;s 3:00</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.960" end="01:26:00.820" style="s2">a.m. so I feel like I sadly need to let</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.400" end="01:26:01.810" style="s2">you go it&#39;s been a dude it&#39;s been six</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.820" end="01:26:05.790" style="s2">months since we&#39;ve been planning this</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.810" end="01:26:11.159" style="s2">and I&#39;m so grateful for you coming on</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.790" end="01:26:11.159" style="s2">can&#39;t share a closing thought absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.310" end="01:26:26.110" style="s2">every emotion has a value and has a</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.480" end="01:26:28.570" style="s2">place and so someone has an idea that a</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.110" end="01:26:32.920" style="s2">more developed human state never has</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.570" end="01:26:34.510" style="s2">sadness or anger or fear then their idea</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.920" end="01:26:40.210" style="s2">of a more developed human state as a</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.510" end="01:26:42.719" style="s2">sociopath because the key kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.210" end="01:26:45.370" style="s2">definition and sociopathy is can&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.719" end="01:26:46.989" style="s2">fear and remorse and guilt and certain</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.370" end="01:26:49.650" style="s2">negative emotions which is why they can</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.989" end="01:26:49.650" style="s2">hurt people so easily</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.950" end="01:26:53.010" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.250" end="01:27:05.849" style="s2">so if I&#39;m angry I&#39;m angry because maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.949" end="01:27:08.429" style="s2">I can process it better and I can I can</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.849" end="01:27:09.659" style="s2">write maybe I can I made up some fake</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.429" end="01:27:11.400" style="s2">meanings and I&#39;m angry about something</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.659" end="01:27:12.750" style="s2">that didn&#39;t even really happen I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.400" end="01:27:16.199" style="s2">took what that person said the wrong way</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.750" end="01:27:17.969" style="s2">whatever but insofar as I&#39;m there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.199" end="01:27:19.860" style="s2">real thing and I&#39;m responding to it and</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.969" end="01:27:21.510" style="s2">anger is rising it&#39;s the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.860" end="01:27:23.190" style="s2">something that I care about or that I</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.510" end="01:27:24.750" style="s2">love that I think somebody&#39;s harming and</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.190" end="01:27:26.039" style="s2">I&#39;m focused on who&#39;s harming it right</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.750" end="01:27:27.750" style="s2">I&#39;m angry about litter because it</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.039" end="01:27:29.400" style="s2">actually there&#39;s a care for nature in</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.750" end="01:27:32.460" style="s2">the environment that is the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.400" end="01:27:34.170" style="s2">that or someone&#39;s hurting an animal or a</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.460" end="01:27:36.570" style="s2">kid or whatever it is and then anger</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.170" end="01:27:40.050" style="s2">arises so the basis of the anchor is</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.570" end="01:27:41.340" style="s2">love if there wasn&#39;t something I loved</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.050" end="01:27:47.579" style="s2">and cared about it just wouldn&#39;t give a</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.340" end="01:27:50.670" style="s2">shit go ahead and hurt it and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.579" end="01:27:53.010" style="s2">afraid I&#39;m afraid that something that I</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.670" end="01:27:56.190" style="s2">care about is going to be harmed so</p>
