<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">and mindfully scratch your itch</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">noticing if you can if the mere act of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">acquiescing to scratch makes the itch go</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.840" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">kira kroger observation i&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">that some of my desires are wrapped up</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">in an angry super critical voice</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">and so sitting with that feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">difficult but softening which</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">gives me hope yes kyra i totally</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">uh empathize with you that is also</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">um that the some of these desires</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">um express themselves almost in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">demanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">if you say critical or harsh voice</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:05.840" style="s2">because they are desires</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">that are born not just out of need</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">or want but they are desire we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">desires that are born</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">also out of hurt</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i mentioned last time</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">about you talk about you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">desire for pleasure and fear of pain</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">but the desire and fear</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">are bound up together uh in important</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">and so we also desire to avoid pain</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">and so some of our desires can often be</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">born out of hurt</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">uh and they can or they can be born</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">under frustration</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">um they can be born out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">a demand placed upon us by a sadistic</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">superego</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">um so yes um and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.480" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">listening to them and being with them i</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">i like</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">i like the way it sounds to me like</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">i encourage everybody to do</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.279" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">example but the way you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">integrating them together is if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">if you set yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">the being mode to befriend that desire</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">in a virtuous manner it will soften</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">it will soften the voice will soften and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">typically once the voice softens enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">the desire shifts</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to describe what that feels</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">like but it goes from being a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">it goes from being sort of a fevered</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">to more of us like to something that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">can more</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">uh deeply savor when when it is</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">of observations which is great</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">i&#39;m finding music particularly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">harmony in particular</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">the song in particular resonates with me</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">so so i thank you all i wonder what part</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">of the ecology practices</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">is calling that forth from you um maybe</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">uh perhaps it&#39;s the reciprocal opening</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">uh meta perhaps it&#39;s prajna all of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">tend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">increase my awareness of the sheer</p>
