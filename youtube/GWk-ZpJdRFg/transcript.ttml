<p begin="00:00:03.020" end="00:00:07.919" style="s2">so in the last few days as we see what</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.180" end="00:00:10.230" style="s2">started in Minneapolis and then went to</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:13.019" style="s2">Atlanta and Seattle and then everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:15.780" style="s2">in the US it&#39;s interesting how consuming</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">a new cycle can make the most concerning</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.780" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">issue of three days ago almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2">completely absent in people&#39;s minds and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">attention but you also lose almost all</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">perspective if that happens so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">important to kind of pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">the sequence of things and the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:34.649" style="s2">arc and the things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">forefront in the attention cycle so</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.649" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">right before the racial violence became</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">forefront we were seeing in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">escalation towards violence there was</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">very left-right oriented between red</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:50.219" style="s2">state blue state having different focus</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">around how they were going to open and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.219" end="00:00:55.020" style="s2">it was kind of showing up as the mask</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">wears versus the non mask wears and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.020" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">saw armed people going to Capitol</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">buildings in protest of quarantine and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">shut down we also started to see an</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">increase in racial focus in the news</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">over the week leading up to the case in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:25.909" style="s2">Minneapolis that set it all off and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">not gonna say like a single narrative of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.909" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">some central command and control</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">function that I think is orchestrating</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">everything but I&#39;m gonna mention</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">anomalies that I think you should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:41.150" style="s2">paying attention to so we see the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">of the man who was jogging and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.150" end="00:01:48.770" style="s2">retired cop and his son shot him that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">was like a week before and then we see</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.770" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">increased news of white supremacy and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">lot more images of white guys with guns</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">at Capitol buildings then we see in</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:04.310" style="s2">relationship to the guy who was running</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:08.069" style="s2">and got shot and there were protests</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.310" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">black open carry of weapons associated</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">with the protests and then also black</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:18.840" style="s2">open carry of weapons taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">escorting a black lawmaker to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.840" end="00:02:25.569" style="s2">courthouse or some state building and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:27.819" style="s2">then we see Joe Biden&#39;s comments about</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.569" end="00:02:31.349" style="s2">you ain&#39;t black and like just a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.819" end="00:02:37.390" style="s2">bunch of increase in race attention in</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.349" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">primary news cycles and then we see the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.390" end="00:02:42.370" style="s2">case with George Floyd so there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:47.099" style="s2">question for me of like did we just have</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.370" end="00:02:50.349" style="s2">a particular unusually racist week or</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.099" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">does the new cycle not actually reflect</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.349" end="00:02:59.799" style="s2">the background rate of things for other</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:03:01.989" style="s2">reasons and for it for every situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.799" end="00:03:06.459" style="s2">like we see with George Floyd the number</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.989" end="00:03:08.230" style="s2">of those that aren&#39;t caught like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.459" end="00:03:10.030" style="s2">just um it&#39;s just a much less rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.230" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">phenomena than I think most people think</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:14.230" style="s2">it is sadly I think most black people in</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">inner cities know it&#39;s not as rare a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.230" end="00:03:24.190" style="s2">phenomena so then we see the video</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:27.010" style="s2">circulating that the we see this guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.190" end="00:03:28.780" style="s2">with a hammer and black tactical gear</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.010" end="00:03:32.049" style="s2">breaking the windows of the autozone</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.780" end="00:03:34.630" style="s2">right in Minneapolis and we see people</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.049" end="00:03:39.880" style="s2">jumping to thinking assessing that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.630" end="00:03:42.970" style="s2">a cop as an agent provocateur or that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.880" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">is a antifa guy or a white supremacist</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.970" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">or a Soros agent there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:49.389" style="s2">different hypotheses but a lot of images</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:51.220" style="s2">are surfacing of the buildings being set</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.389" end="00:03:55.090" style="s2">on fire and the windows being broken by</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.220" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">white people at the black protest</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.090" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">rallies that were not breaking like me</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.780" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">and the initial movement to property</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:04.870" style="s2">destruction and violence was not</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:08.500" style="s2">actually then and broken windows theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.870" end="00:04:10.870" style="s2">is very clear that once like who ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.500" end="00:04:14.049" style="s2">the first Molotov cocktails thrown and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.870" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">it becomes much easier to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.049" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">throwing Molotov cocktails once the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">first windows are broken because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:25.630" style="s2">like a threshold to move past that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.569" style="s2">has already been broken and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.569" end="00:04:33.780" style="s2">police officers or people with other</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.220" end="00:04:35.669" style="s2">agendas infiltrate a protest group that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.780" end="00:04:38.759" style="s2">is otherwise peaceful and throw the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.669" end="00:04:40.259" style="s2">first rock to justify use of police</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.759" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">force on the other side like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.259" end="00:04:44.909" style="s2">very well-known phenomenon but right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:46.259" style="s2">we can hypothesize a lot of groups that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.909" end="00:04:48.539" style="s2">would have a motive to do it for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.259" end="00:04:50.039" style="s2">of reasons so some people either are</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.539" end="00:04:51.960" style="s2">buying the standard narrative or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.039" end="00:04:53.789" style="s2">too quickly jumping to the alternate</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.960" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">narrative of it was the cop for this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.789" end="00:04:59.060" style="s2">reason or it was the white supremacists</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:03.210" style="s2">trying to blame the black guys or it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.060" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">the deep state Hillary Clinton Joe Biden</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.210" end="00:05:08.310" style="s2">supporting liberals that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">create incite more reason to have people</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">stay at home than the quarantine already</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">was to move towards their goal to steal</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">an election there&#39;s like a gazillion</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:22.259" style="s2">hypotheses I think the problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:23.969" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t buying the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.259" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">media narrative are buying the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.969" end="00:05:28.409" style="s2">alternate narrative that appeals to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:30.289" style="s2">their sense making desire to not have</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.409" end="00:05:32.849" style="s2">uncertainty and put the pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.289" end="00:05:34.289" style="s2">before there&#39;s adequate evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.849" end="00:05:38.849" style="s2">that alternate narrative is actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.289" end="00:05:42.599" style="s2">much better so the guy who broke the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.849" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">windows was definitely not a normal part</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.599" end="00:05:49.580" style="s2">of the protest but I don&#39;t know who he</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:52.710" style="s2">was an agent for or what the motive was</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.580" end="00:05:54.300" style="s2">because the data that suggests any of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.710" end="00:05:57.590" style="s2">the 10 different hypotheses are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.300" end="00:06:00.750" style="s2">solid yet so one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.590" end="00:06:03.090" style="s2">wanting to encourage is don&#39;t let your</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.750" end="00:06:05.069" style="s2">attention cycle be controlled by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">attention cycle of your social media</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.069" end="00:06:10.379" style="s2">feed or your mainstream news that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:14.879" style="s2">thing the other thing is be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.379" end="00:06:16.860" style="s2">about how easy it is to get induced into</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.879" end="00:06:19.529" style="s2">being on one side of groupthink and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.860" end="00:06:22.349" style="s2">conflict theory let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.529" end="00:06:25.050" style="s2">conflict theory for a moment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.349" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a few types of natural cleaving</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.050" end="00:06:31.080" style="s2">x&#39; or easy cleaving Ziff not natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:33.870" style="s2">where it&#39;s very easy to drive conflict</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:35.820" style="s2">between people political left-right is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.870" end="00:06:38.789" style="s2">very easy one you can do red state blue</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.820" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">state stuff you can do they have a make</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.789" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">America</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:44.939" style="s2">again hat versus a rainbow gay flag at</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:47.849" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re literally wearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.939" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">flags of different kinds to symbolize</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.849" end="00:06:51.719" style="s2">red shirt blue shirt right like the type</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.710" end="00:06:54.360" style="s2">type of team they&#39;re in and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.719" end="00:06:57.419" style="s2">drive conflict between them which both</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.360" end="00:06:59.460" style="s2">creates a sense of clear sense making of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.419" end="00:07:02.129" style="s2">I know who my team is I know what my</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.460" end="00:07:07.500" style="s2">might the group think of the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.129" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">on my side it is and so red blue is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.500" end="00:07:13.590" style="s2">easy people versus the cops is very easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:16.889" style="s2">race issues are very easy races may be</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.590" end="00:07:23.279" style="s2">the easiest because it&#39;s where the flag</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.889" end="00:07:26.569" style="s2">is biologically built-in if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.279" end="00:07:28.949" style="s2">here has not studied conflict theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.569" end="00:07:30.870" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a hard time making</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">that are worth studying but at a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.560" end="00:07:53.339" style="s2">everybody should know Rene Gerard&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:55.560" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.339" end="00:08:00.750" style="s2">Gerard there are things that he said</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.560" end="00:08:03.259" style="s2">that we&#39;re extremely insightful so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.750" end="00:08:07.259" style="s2">specifically his idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.259" end="00:08:10.610" style="s2">fundamental nature of conflicts comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.259" end="00:08:14.909" style="s2">from the fact that desire is mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.610" end="00:08:16.589" style="s2">meaning that we learn to want stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.909" end="00:08:19.319" style="s2">same way we learn language by watching</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.589" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">other people and that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.319" end="00:08:23.430" style="s2">Mandarin and I don&#39;t know so he Lee and</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.659" end="00:08:28.740" style="s2">people speak in English so I got</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.550" end="00:08:31.409" style="s2">conditioned to think in a world view</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.740" end="00:08:33.839" style="s2">through aesthetic frames through like</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.409" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very deep how much my whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">identity and everything was conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:40.829" style="s2">by what I watched so his arguments is</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:45.000" style="s2">that much of what we want is also</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.829" end="00:08:47.100" style="s2">conditioned by watching people and so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.000" end="00:08:49.890" style="s2">end up in Nate Lee wanting what other</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.100" end="00:08:51.959" style="s2">people have which means that desire and</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.660" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">similar kinds of things then as more</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">people are wanting the same things and</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:07.350" style="s2">becomes mimetic people learn through</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.899" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">mimesis to identify with the zionist or</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.350" end="00:09:11.100" style="s2">the anti-zionist side based on which</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:13.230" style="s2">side of the wall they grew up on or the</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.230" end="00:09:18.930" style="s2">happen to have been born into and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:20.700" style="s2">in Gerard&#39;s model the conflict continues</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:23.430" style="s2">to increase until there&#39;s so much</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.430" end="00:09:27.149" style="s2">something like a war and the least</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.260" end="00:09:30.540" style="s2">violent way to deal with it is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.149" end="00:09:33.029" style="s2">scapegoat a sacrificial rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.540" end="00:09:35.540" style="s2">all against all war be able to have some</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.540" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">that is able to be effectively blamed</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.070" end="00:09:42.899" style="s2">for the whole scenario and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:44.579" style="s2">able to take them out and decrease the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.899" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">embodied conflict energy for a while</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.579" end="00:09:55.709" style="s2">then the cycle has to repeat jords work</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:57.540" style="s2">really says that there is no there</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.709" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">historically has been no way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.540" end="00:10:03.390" style="s2">and the role of various religions was to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:05.610" style="s2">figure out how to do scapegoating well</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.390" end="00:10:07.230" style="s2">and that that&#39;s what all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.610" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">sacrifices of various religious</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.230" end="00:10:12.449" style="s2">traditions were about that Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:14.579" style="s2">was actually trying to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.449" end="00:10:16.890" style="s2">scapegoating by showing the person they</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.579" end="00:10:18.980" style="s2">scapegoated was actually innocent - not</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.890" end="00:10:21.449" style="s2">only innocent with the highest kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.980" end="00:10:24.779" style="s2">innocence so that the way people would</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.449" end="00:10:26.339" style="s2">get out of his answer actually of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.779" end="00:10:30.690" style="s2">you get out of scapegoating was everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.339" end="00:10:32.730" style="s2">developed christ-like virtues but</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.690" end="00:10:34.500" style="s2">specifically as critique said that by</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.730" end="00:10:36.149" style="s2">getting rid of religion and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.500" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">relevant to the goals of this group that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.149" end="00:10:46.170" style="s2">is trying to reinvent of human virtue by</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:48.540" style="s2">getting rid of religion we got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.170" end="00:10:52.380" style="s2">the way of dealing with the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.540" end="00:10:54.529" style="s2">conflict while simultaneously getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.380" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">much much larger weapons of destruction</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.529" end="00:11:00.449" style="s2">so that rather than have things heat up</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.520" style="s2">in Europe and kill a Jew sacrificially</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.449" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">it had to be this massive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.520" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">killing of all of these Jews and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.730" end="00:11:11.960" style="s2">okay so why am i bringing that up I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.280" end="00:11:22.350" style="s2">think it&#39;s very easy to I think there</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.770" end="00:11:27.270" style="s2">are lots of reasons to want to drive</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.350" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">conflict and to want to keep groups of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.270" end="00:11:32.190" style="s2">people having attention focused in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:36.050" style="s2">different ways maybe this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.190" end="00:11:36.050" style="s2">the way I&#39;ll talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:43.050" style="s2">power pretty much translates to power</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.300" end="00:11:44.850" style="s2">over other people to have power over</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.050" end="00:11:47.550" style="s2">their behaviors whether I want people to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.850" end="00:11:49.590" style="s2">vote for me in a particular way or I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.550" end="00:11:52.470" style="s2">want them to buy my stuff or I want them</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.590" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">to publicly support my ideas I need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.470" end="00:11:55.380" style="s2">control other people&#39;s behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">control their behavior I need to control</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.380" end="00:12:05.700" style="s2">their minds and so warfare is main</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">mainly not fought with bullets like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.700" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">kinetic warfare that we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">warfare that&#39;s fought with weapons is</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">maybe 1% of warfare 99% of warfare is</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:18.150" style="s2">diplomatic warfare political warfare</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:20.670" style="s2">economic warfare narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.150" end="00:12:23.010" style="s2">information warfare all of this comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.670" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">together to what we call hybrid warfare</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.010" end="00:12:30.420" style="s2">or really just politics or game theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:35.160" style="s2">or the game of power but but think of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.420" end="00:12:36.410" style="s2">as high hybrid or population centric</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.160" end="00:12:42.030" style="s2">warfare</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.410" end="00:12:44.190" style="s2">so in this war the treasure being fought</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.030" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">over is people&#39;s minds and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.190" end="00:12:54.750" style="s2">battleground is people&#39;s minds the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:57.690" style="s2">primary weapons are tools the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.750" end="00:12:59.310" style="s2">narrative influence and emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.690" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">vacation and control of the information</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.310" end="00:13:06.930" style="s2">flows and in these wars they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">asymmetric wars because you have some</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.930" end="00:13:13.130" style="s2">actors that have access to billion or</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:17.100" style="s2">trillion-dollar level information</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.100" end="00:13:19.649" style="s2">targeting and then you have other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.140" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">are just</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.649" end="00:13:22.579" style="s2">to figure shit out on their own and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:25.290" style="s2">don&#39;t even know they&#39;re in a war and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.579" end="00:13:26.879" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know that their own mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.290" end="00:13:28.259" style="s2">is the battleground of the war and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.879" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">think they believe the shit they believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.259" end="00:13:30.869" style="s2">and they think they came to it on their</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.869" end="00:13:37.649" style="s2">sense making and they don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.019" end="00:13:39.720" style="s2">as they&#39;re researching of the trillions</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.649" end="00:13:41.459" style="s2">of pages of shit they could see the ones</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.720" end="00:13:43.050" style="s2">that they will ever even be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.459" end="00:13:44.779" style="s2">based on what shows up in their YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.050" end="00:13:46.740" style="s2">feed or their Google search or</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.449" end="00:14:03.240" style="s2">out from the current violence for</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.970" end="00:14:07.910" style="s2">moments we have an election coming up in</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.929" end="00:14:19.829" style="s2">election is illegally tampered with and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.029" end="00:14:24.870" style="s2">stolen or not half of the population</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.829" end="00:14:25.559" style="s2">will think it was this is a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.870" end="00:14:28.019" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.559" end="00:14:29.670" style="s2">because what happens when a third to a</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.149" end="00:14:39.149" style="s2">consequential well like one of two</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:57.449" style="s2">want to steal elections get even clearer</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.459" end="00:15:00.899" style="s2">that they just can with impunity so</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.449" end="00:15:05.249" style="s2">we&#39;re like fuck what do we do with this</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.970" end="00:17:25.890" style="s2">when we start to get second waves here</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.950" end="00:17:32.420" style="s2">and the political tension is so heated</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.590" end="00:17:39.890" style="s2">then we also start to see things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:44.040" style="s2">because of the Cova chat down of</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.860" end="00:18:15.990" style="s2">situation but after Syria it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.990" end="00:18:20.309" style="s2">so then what it what comes from that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:22.530" style="s2">conflict why so we&#39;re definitely at a</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.780" end="00:19:18.270" style="s2">how do we respond</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.040" end="00:19:20.280" style="s2">I always feel stuck when someone asks me</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.270" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2">there how do we for some very large</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.280" end="00:19:23.940" style="s2">audience have we respond because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.740" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">gonna be very different based on</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.940" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">people&#39;s skills and capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:30.290" style="s2">interests there&#39;s not like a very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:30.290" style="s2">generalized answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.500" end="00:19:38.580" style="s2">like David how are you responding well</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:40.980" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to both put out</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.580" end="00:19:42.540" style="s2">information that helps people and share</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.980" end="00:19:44.370" style="s2">frames that help people process</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.540" end="00:19:46.169" style="s2">information and maybe that helps them</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.370" end="00:19:48.120" style="s2">get less emotionally hijacked so they</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.169" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">can have some more clarity like those</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.120" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">seem like within your bailiwick of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:56.630" style="s2">things to do that you can do super</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:56.630" style="s2">important things that need done</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:02.090" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be an equivalent of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.750" end="00:20:07.010" style="s2">in totally different ways that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.090" end="00:20:11.630" style="s2">on here has as a possibility so I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.010" end="00:20:16.100" style="s2">people recognizing that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.630" end="00:20:21.169" style="s2">have some choice and where they put</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.100" end="00:20:22.850" style="s2">their attention and some choice in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.169" end="00:20:27.980" style="s2">meaning they make so both where they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.850" end="00:20:29.210" style="s2">focus and actually they have choice and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.980" end="00:20:30.950" style="s2">where they put their attention they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.210" end="00:20:34.549" style="s2">choice in the process of coming to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.950" end="00:20:36.289" style="s2">belief are they just kind of letting</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.549" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">themselves by the conclusions put in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.289" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">front or are they really asking that am</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:42.140" style="s2">I sure of this how would I be sure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:44.210" style="s2">this because they&#39;re going there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.140" end="00:20:46.940" style="s2">to be a response to their own sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.210" end="00:20:48.950" style="s2">certainty or uncertainty and they also</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.940" end="00:20:50.600" style="s2">have some choice in the meaning they</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.950" end="00:20:53.149" style="s2">make around the things and all this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.600" end="00:20:55.340" style="s2">gonna affect their state so it means</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.149" end="00:20:58.149" style="s2">it&#39;s overwhelm is something someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.340" end="00:21:03.350" style="s2">really has a choice to indulge or not</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.149" end="00:21:04.850" style="s2">and so sometimes I&#39;ll notice that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.350" end="00:21:06.500" style="s2">there&#39;s so much coming in and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.850" end="00:21:07.820" style="s2">what the fuck do I do about this and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.500" end="00:21:11.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a beginning impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">overwhelmed and I know I I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.330" end="00:21:16.070" style="s2">to pretend or repress it but I also know</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">that going into an overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.070" end="00:21:21.590" style="s2">is not useful and I have a kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">commitment to be useful so I have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.590" end="00:21:25.720" style="s2">commitment to want to think about things</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">in a way that allows me to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.720" end="00:21:29.990" style="s2">respond so I&#39;ll be like okay well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:31.610" style="s2">just step back and actually write down</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.990" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">what are all the things that I see going</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.610" end="00:21:36.409" style="s2">on let&#39;s make a situational assessment</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:39.230" style="s2">map right let&#39;s so rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.409" end="00:21:40.669" style="s2">start to spiral into something like let</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.230" end="00:21:42.200" style="s2">me start to identify what are the knowns</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.669" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">what are the unknowns what are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.200" end="00:21:44.870" style="s2">things I might be able to do something</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:46.730" style="s2">about where I want to put more of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.870" end="00:21:48.140" style="s2">sense making into that area because I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.730" end="00:21:53.210" style="s2">might actually have some agency in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.140" end="00:21:55.279" style="s2">area so some people on here that will</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.210" end="00:22:00.279" style="s2">what is theirs to do will be largely</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.279" end="00:22:00.279" style="s2">around serving their local communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:10.470" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.260" end="00:22:12.210" style="s2">other people might have might work in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.470" end="00:22:13.350" style="s2">the finance sector and have specific</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.210" end="00:22:15.660" style="s2">things that they can do that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.350" end="00:22:18.060" style="s2">particularly meaningful to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.660" end="00:22:27.780" style="s2">get the right types of projects funded</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.060" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">or yeah I don&#39;t know what I can say not</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.780" end="00:22:35.550" style="s2">to do right is definitely make sure okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:38.030" style="s2">here&#39;s an important one I&#39;ll say one</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.769" end="00:26:15.429" style="s2">think about what might be yours to do</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.129" end="00:26:29.409" style="s2">if we go through and look at all of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.309" end="00:26:35.539" style="s2">say what is the system that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.889" end="00:26:37.549" style="s2">breaking down and what would a better</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.539" end="00:26:39.830" style="s2">version of that system be and what could</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.549" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2">we do to implement those better versions</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.830" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">of the system rather than try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:45.499" style="s2">reinstate the security of the old ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">that would be a beginning of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.499" end="00:26:50.120" style="s2">about the opportunity space and we could</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:51.379" style="s2">talk about that with global finance we</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.379" end="00:26:55.009" style="s2">we could talk about it with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.490" end="00:26:58.990" style="s2">healthcare system on and on write the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.009" end="00:27:01.100" style="s2">judicial reform all those things and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.990" end="00:27:04.210" style="s2">someone just posted this in the chat and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.100" end="00:27:07.009" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really true so far it seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.210" end="00:27:10.340" style="s2">that the pandemic and the crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.009" end="00:27:12.259" style="s2">accelerating all of the we&#39;re not in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.340" end="00:27:14.090" style="s2">shift into a new system it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.259" end="00:27:18.039" style="s2">just accelerating and compounding all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.090" end="00:27:23.059" style="s2">the worst aspects of the old one most</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.039" end="00:27:25.299" style="s2">sense of of how that process might play</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.059" end="00:27:35.179" style="s2">out and where where&#39;s the sort of hope</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.299" end="00:27:42.860" style="s2">in that if there is any most people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.179" end="00:27:45.710" style="s2">care about things widely care about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.860" end="00:27:51.169" style="s2">global Commons long term suck at doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.710" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">things like they suck at doing things at</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.169" end="00:27:56.210" style="s2">scale because most anyone is good at</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:59.330" style="s2">doing things at scale one at the game of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.210" end="00:28:02.149" style="s2">power because to do things at scale</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.330" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">means to be able to influence things in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.149" end="00:28:07.850" style="s2">a way that will beat out competitors and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:12.019" style="s2">go against people who want things to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.850" end="00:28:14.029" style="s2">otherwise so right now there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.019" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">people dirt like during the Cova time</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.029" end="00:28:18.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people feeling like</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.309" end="00:28:39.820" style="s2">during this time so one of the things I</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.250" end="00:30:45.630" style="s2">were involved in in Vietnam and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.920" end="00:30:47.970" style="s2">counterculture movement and who were</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.630" end="00:30:51.980" style="s2">involved in different times that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.970" end="00:30:51.980" style="s2">relevant and to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.450" end="00:31:04.030" style="s2">so like I have a friend mark Stallman he</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.490" end="00:31:09.160" style="s2">was involved during that generation but</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.030" end="00:31:11.650" style="s2">he was doing intelligence work and like</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.160" end="00:31:15.640" style="s2">he was working with Freeman Dyson</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.650" end="00:31:18.550" style="s2">directly regarding what was brought to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.640" end="00:31:21.130" style="s2">JFK to do with Khrushchev that was a big</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.550" end="00:31:23.380" style="s2">part of what&#39;s led to things broke down</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.130" end="00:31:27.090" style="s2">there so there&#39;s knowledge that he has</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.380" end="00:31:31.500" style="s2">firsthand that super directly relevant</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.090" end="00:31:31.500" style="s2">but like when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.910" end="00:31:38.140" style="s2">counterculture movement as a whole and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.890" end="00:31:40.350" style="s2">look at the Green Revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.140" end="00:31:45.190" style="s2">sexual revolution and the Civil Rights</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:49.090" style="s2">process and the women&#39;s rights all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.190" end="00:31:51.190" style="s2">various things the deeper story that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.090" end="00:31:54.820" style="s2">see most of the activists who were there</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.190" end="00:31:57.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know the deeper story I see is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.820" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">like actually understanding COINTELPRO</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.070" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">and how the FBI CIA and other</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:07.960" style="s2">intelligence agencies actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:10.360" style="s2">infiltrated the the progressive</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.960" end="00:32:13.540" style="s2">movements to very specifically derail</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.360" end="00:32:15.640" style="s2">them and get them focused on shift it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.540" end="00:32:16.650" style="s2">would be an effective that is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.640" end="00:32:20.350" style="s2">still doing today</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.650" end="00:32:23.050" style="s2">so I happen to believe that there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.350" end="00:32:25.180" style="s2">intentional up regulation by those power</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.050" end="00:32:29.470" style="s2">structures of post-modernism as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.180" end="00:32:31.780" style="s2">structure of thought because if the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.470" end="00:32:33.520" style="s2">people who studied social science only</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.780" end="00:32:35.260" style="s2">studied how to critique the game of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.520" end="00:32:37.540" style="s2">power without actually knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.260" end="00:32:38.620" style="s2">effectively organize then it would make</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.540" end="00:32:41.590" style="s2">sure that they never could actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.620" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">really do anything so if every time</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.590" end="00:32:46.630" style="s2">someone&#39;s organizing well you call it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:48.730" style="s2">imperialism you won&#39;t end up organizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.630" end="00:32:54.040" style="s2">well becoming an imperialist so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.730" end="00:32:59.560" style="s2">just be noise and that&#39;s fine and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.040" end="00:33:01.780" style="s2">social sciences that are like actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.560" end="00:33:04.390" style="s2">studying the history of military theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.780" end="00:33:05.530" style="s2">and political theory and and strategy</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.390" end="00:33:08.530" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.530" end="00:33:11.080" style="s2">got very downregulated in exchange for</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.530" end="00:33:12.700" style="s2">something that would make people feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.080" end="00:33:18.790" style="s2">more righteous while being less</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.700" end="00:33:20.620" style="s2">effective and so I want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.790" end="00:33:27.610" style="s2">that we&#39;re learning the right lessons</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.620" end="00:33:29.290" style="s2">from the right periods of history so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.610" end="00:33:31.510" style="s2">what I would say is that when I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.290" end="00:33:34.390" style="s2">about generations and I take all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.510" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">generations that are alive now I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.390" end="00:33:40.510" style="s2">say that 99% of the people in all those</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">generations have been the victims of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.510" end="00:33:44.380" style="s2">intentional disinformation and a mostly</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:46.360" style="s2">just all confused so we can have</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.380" end="00:33:50.290" style="s2">intergenerational sharing of some</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.360" end="00:33:51.370" style="s2">confused generations with others it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.290" end="00:33:57.220" style="s2">still nice to have different</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.370" end="00:33:59.560" style="s2">perspectives but I would mostly like for</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.220" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">people to have more clear and incisive</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.560" end="00:34:04.150" style="s2">insight at all and across a longer time</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.100" style="s2">period than their own experience a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.150" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">deeper study of history and like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.100" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">so I was just wondering what you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:11.100" style="s2">where you feel stuck and you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:15.580" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of in a hopeless situation</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.100" end="00:34:19.840" style="s2">making space for grief so emotions of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.580" end="00:34:21.429" style="s2">all kind can influence our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.840" end="00:34:28.659" style="s2">they can also influence our choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.429" end="00:34:31.570" style="s2">making I want we all know what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.659" end="00:34:33.580" style="s2">to have emotions that are not being</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.570" end="00:34:38.230" style="s2">clearly processed influenced our choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.580" end="00:34:45.159" style="s2">making in damaging ways right reacting</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.230" end="00:34:47.590" style="s2">out of anger or whatever but then we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.159" end="00:34:49.960" style="s2">also say ok so I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.590" end="00:34:53.260" style="s2">reactive emotionally so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.960" end="00:34:55.450" style="s2">suppress emotions and pretend to do like</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.260" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">do a bad version of Stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.450" end="00:35:02.230" style="s2">and just numb down emotional</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:05.730" style="s2">intelligence in which case I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.230" end="00:35:08.260" style="s2">one whole type of information one whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.730" end="00:35:14.350" style="s2">way of sense making and turning it off</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.260" end="00:35:16.150" style="s2">and you could call emotion um this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.350" end="00:35:18.370" style="s2">reductive but I&#39;m just saying one lens</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.150" end="00:35:19.090" style="s2">you could call emotion a way of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.370" end="00:35:25.720" style="s2">able to read</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.090" end="00:35:27.910" style="s2">data partly our emotion is responding to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.720" end="00:35:29.650" style="s2">the situation partly our emotion is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.910" end="00:35:31.930" style="s2">responding to the narrative we make of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.650" end="00:35:33.340" style="s2">the situation so in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.930" end="00:35:35.620" style="s2">narrative we make that&#39;s where we want</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.340" end="00:35:37.870" style="s2">to do CBT or DBT or Byron Katie&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.620" end="00:35:39.400" style="s2">work or Krishnamurti inquiry it&#39;s a see</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.870" end="00:35:41.830" style="s2">where did I make up some meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.400" end="00:35:45.750" style="s2">fucked me up but then there are some</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.830" end="00:35:48.130" style="s2">times where it&#39;s like if I see a cop</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.750" end="00:35:50.140" style="s2">kneeling on someone&#39;s neck and killing</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.130" end="00:35:53.430" style="s2">them and I don&#39;t feel angry something is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.140" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">wrong with me like that&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.430" end="00:35:58.300" style="s2">meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:59.830" style="s2">I actually try and say no I&#39;m only upset</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.300" end="00:36:01.510" style="s2">because if meaning-making means I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.830" end="00:36:03.700" style="s2">to instantiate a metaphysics where</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.510" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">nothing matters and then say well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.700" end="00:36:07.390" style="s2">meaning made well yes I have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:09.190" style="s2">metaphysics where things matter and in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.390" end="00:36:13.090" style="s2">metaphysics where anything matters then</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.190" end="00:36:14.920" style="s2">if the sacred is being harmed I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.090" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">pissed off I can feel sad I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.920" end="00:36:25.210" style="s2">scared right so you know I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:26.890" style="s2">inundated in data about catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.210" end="00:36:29.500" style="s2">risk so the most fucked up things all</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.890" end="00:36:31.480" style="s2">the time and so it doesn&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.500" end="00:36:32.860" style="s2">emotional response immediately that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.480" end="00:36:37.390" style="s2">did the first time that I was exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.860" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">it but I still will just sit back put my</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.390" end="00:36:41.740" style="s2">computer down and just cry when I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:43.390" style="s2">about what&#39;s fucking happening in</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.740" end="00:36:46.870" style="s2">Nigeria or when I think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.390" end="00:36:48.760" style="s2">about to happen or because if I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.870" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">will actually have to dead in something</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.760" end="00:36:52.330" style="s2">and then I become less sensitive which</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:56.530" style="s2">means my sensing decreases and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.330" end="00:36:59.290" style="s2">wholeness of self decreases so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.530" end="00:37:01.510" style="s2">you neither want to let you neither want</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.290" end="00:37:02.980" style="s2">to repress the emotions and not listen</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.980" end="00:37:08.020" style="s2">want to just unconsciously act on them</p>
