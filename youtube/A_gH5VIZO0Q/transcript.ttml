<p begin="00:00:17.189" end="00:00:24.529" style="s2">meaning crisis so last time we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.609" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">the important and foundational work of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.529" end="00:00:29.879" style="s2">Plato the grammar of Western</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">civilization is basically made up of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.879" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">the Bible and Plato will keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:39.270" style="s2">back to both of those repeatedly in</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:42.780" style="s2">certain ways and we talked about Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.270" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">notion of wisdom and how it involved</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.780" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">this process of aligning the psyche so</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:52.560" style="s2">as to reduce inner conflict and reduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">self-deception by bullshitting ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.560" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">and that how that enabled us to also</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">achieve one of our meta desires the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">desire for inner peace but how we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:06.030" style="s2">also align that reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">self-deception with getting more in</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.030" end="00:01:12.899" style="s2">contact with what&#39;s real and that as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:14.579" style="s2">practice tracking real patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.899" end="00:01:16.549" style="s2">world we could then reflectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.579" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">internalize that back on ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.549" end="00:01:21.179" style="s2">there was an intimate connection between</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:24.389" style="s2">how we knew the world and knew ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.179" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">and as we increased our ability to pick</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.389" end="00:01:28.499" style="s2">up on real patterns we could increase</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:30.929" style="s2">our self-knowledge reduce our</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.499" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">self-deception increase our contact with</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.929" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">reality and that would flow in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">process of an agog a and that would</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">bring about the satisfaction of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">second Metta desire which is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:44.819" style="s2">contact with realness and so Plato has</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:47.279" style="s2">this idea of wisdom as this an agogic</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.819" end="00:01:50.099" style="s2">process and we talked about that in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.279" end="00:01:53.789" style="s2">connection with his great parable the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.099" end="00:01:58.529" style="s2">parable of the cave I then pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.789" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">that he had just as Socrates was lucky</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.529" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">to have a great disciple in Plato Plato</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">was lucky to have a great disciple in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">Aristotle and Aristotle is pivotal for</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">us because he lays the foundation for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:18.300" style="s2">further aspects of a scientific approach</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">to wisdom and meaning and also for an</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">important formulation of one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:25.850" style="s2">in which we deeply connect the self to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">reality that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.850" end="00:02:29.750" style="s2">talk about when we talk about worldview</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:31.430" style="s2">attunement so as I mentioned Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.750" end="00:02:35.060" style="s2">was a student of Plato he studies with</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.430" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">Plato for about twenty years and then at</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.060" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2">some point he breaks away from Plato</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:43.990" style="s2">famously claiming that while I love</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">Plato I love the truth more Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.990" end="00:02:48.410" style="s2">remained and many people would argue</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:51.080" style="s2">this gearson for example and others that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.410" end="00:02:52.910" style="s2">Aristotle remains in some very important</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.080" end="00:02:55.960" style="s2">senses of plate Ness but there was an</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.910" end="00:03:01.190" style="s2">aspect of Plato&#39;s work that Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.960" end="00:03:04.450" style="s2">thought was lacking Plato did not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.190" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">adequately account for change so</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.450" end="00:03:08.690" style="s2">Aristotle was deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.570" style="s2">Plato&#39;s account of what made for</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.690" end="00:03:13.520" style="s2">something real for us but he thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.570" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">that Plato wasn&#39;t could not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.520" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">explain change very well and he was</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">going to invent some very important</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:20.210" style="s2">concepts that are going to become</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:22.750" style="s2">integral to understanding of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.210" end="00:03:26.420" style="s2">to be meaningfully connected to reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.750" end="00:03:29.270" style="s2">now Aristotle is very influenced by his</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.420" end="00:03:31.190" style="s2">father who is a physician he&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.270" end="00:03:34.040" style="s2">of a biologist than a mathematician so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.190" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">all Plato is much more prone to using</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.040" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">mathematical analogies aerosol is much</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:43.370" style="s2">more used to using biological analogies</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">and the word that Aristotle uses for</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.370" end="00:03:47.240" style="s2">change is actually better translated as</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:48.800" style="s2">growth or development Aristotle was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.240" end="00:03:53.300" style="s2">really interested in how living things</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.800" end="00:03:54.860" style="s2">grow how they develop and that should</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.300" end="00:03:58.190" style="s2">that should prick up your ears right</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.860" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">away because part of I take it what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.190" end="00:04:01.580" style="s2">often mean when we say we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:04.550" style="s2">meaningful life is that we are growing</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.580" end="00:04:06.860" style="s2">or developing in fact people will often</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.550" end="00:04:08.930" style="s2">use the word growth as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.860" end="00:04:11.270" style="s2">indicating an improvement in the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.930" end="00:04:17.870" style="s2">of their life and in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.270" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">developing of wisdom so Aristotle picks</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.870" end="00:04:23.540" style="s2">up on Plato&#39;s notion of the I das so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:28.250" style="s2">you remember last time we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.540" end="00:04:30.260" style="s2">this we talked about that a bird is much</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.250" end="00:04:32.590" style="s2">more than a set of its features it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.260" end="00:04:34.700" style="s2">just a beak it&#39;s not just some feathers</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.590" end="00:04:36.260" style="s2">it&#39;s this Gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.700" end="00:04:38.150" style="s2">it&#39;s that structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.260" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">organization such that all the parts</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.150" end="00:04:41.810" style="s2">function to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:44.930" style="s2">there was a hole and so what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.810" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">something that acts as a bird and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.930" end="00:04:51.259" style="s2">pattern that logos that I toss is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">hard actually to put into words but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.259" end="00:04:56.780" style="s2">very much what does two things for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:04:59.270" style="s2">it&#39;s what makes a bird a bird and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.780" end="00:05:00.860" style="s2">also the pattern by which we come to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.270" end="00:05:03.639" style="s2">know what a bird is when we can grasp</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.860" end="00:05:06.889" style="s2">the structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.639" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">that ID us then we understand what a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.889" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">bird is now Aristotle was very impressed</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:14.060" style="s2">by that but he wanted to give it a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:17.240" style="s2">dynamical approach he wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.060" end="00:05:20.360" style="s2">about it in terms of development and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.240" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">he was very interested as I said in how</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:28.789" style="s2">things grow and he noted the role that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:30.830" style="s2">form had in growth and development so he</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.789" end="00:05:34.610" style="s2">what he did was he first started what by</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">an analogy so he would use the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.610" end="00:05:40.210" style="s2">of artifacts human-made things and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">use that to try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.210" end="00:05:48.169" style="s2">biological things so for example I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:51.590" style="s2">have a block of wood right and I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.169" end="00:05:53.690" style="s2">make it into a chair or perhaps a table</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:57.639" style="s2">or if it&#39;s big enough amount of wood I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.690" end="00:06:00.139" style="s2">can make it into a ship or a boat and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.639" end="00:06:04.039" style="s2">Aristotle asked what makes the wood</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.139" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">behave like a chair as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.039" end="00:06:11.900" style="s2">table or to a ship and this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:13.849" style="s2">get the notion of actuality from we</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.900" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">often use the word actuality in fact as</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.849" end="00:06:17.690" style="s2">a way of talking about realness it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">actual something is a way of saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.690" end="00:06:23.530" style="s2">a real something as opposed to a fraud</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">or simulation so what makes a chair act</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.530" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">like a chair why does the wood act like</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:32.330" style="s2">a chair here act like a table here and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">act like a ship here and so Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.330" end="00:06:40.759" style="s2">said well first of all this is important</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:43.009" style="s2">change and it&#39;s a good analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.759" end="00:06:47.539" style="s2">development when I&#39;m making a chair</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.009" end="00:06:50.610" style="s2">that&#39;s somehow analogous for how an</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.539" end="00:06:54.389" style="s2">organism is growing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.610" end="00:06:56.789" style="s2">so what is it that makes the would act</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.389" end="00:06:59.729" style="s2">like a chair here and act like a table</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.789" end="00:07:02.490" style="s2">here and his argument was well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.729" end="00:07:05.009" style="s2">forum again where this means i dot snot</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.490" end="00:07:06.930" style="s2">shape although you can use shape as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.009" end="00:07:09.449" style="s2">analogy this is the structural</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.930" end="00:07:11.699" style="s2">functional organization the wood is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.449" end="00:07:15.300" style="s2">structurally functionally organized in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.699" end="00:07:18.719" style="s2">such a way that it will act like a chair</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.300" end="00:07:20.819" style="s2">whereas here it will act like a table</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.719" end="00:07:24.629" style="s2">and here it will act like a ship now</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.819" end="00:07:27.889" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s point is that this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.629" end="00:07:30.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not that this doesn&#39;t play any role</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.889" end="00:07:32.610" style="s2">but he invents this really important</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.330" end="00:07:37.889" style="s2">idea he invents the idea that the wood</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.610" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">is potential these terms actual and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.889" end="00:07:42.029" style="s2">potential actually come from aerosol we</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:44.069" style="s2">use them every day we think they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.029" end="00:07:46.529" style="s2">part of our natural grammar but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.069" end="00:07:49.620" style="s2">actually an invention of Aristotle we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.529" end="00:07:51.779" style="s2">going to see how important they are so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.620" end="00:07:54.210" style="s2">the idea is wood is potentially a chair</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.779" end="00:07:55.259" style="s2">what is potentially a table what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.210" end="00:07:58.289" style="s2">potentially a ship</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.259" end="00:08:00.990" style="s2">now when that potential has a particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.289" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">form given to it then it starts acting</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.990" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">like a chair it starts acting like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:06.690" style="s2">table and acting like a ship and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.680" style="s2">where we get the notion of information</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.690" end="00:08:13.589" style="s2">from you put a form into something and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.680" end="00:08:15.029" style="s2">you will actualize its potential namely</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.589" end="00:08:17.009" style="s2">you will give it a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.029" end="00:08:21.889" style="s2">organization so it will start to act in</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.009" end="00:08:25.589" style="s2">a particular manner now that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.889" end="00:08:31.289" style="s2">important and then what Aristotle argued</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.589" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">is well what you see in living things is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.289" end="00:08:37.019" style="s2">that they are basically doing this for</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:38.820" style="s2">themselves so if you&#39;ll use look I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.019" end="00:08:40.789" style="s2">mean this is an analogy a living thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.820" end="00:08:43.910" style="s2">is like a chair that is making itself a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.789" end="00:08:47.790" style="s2">chair imagine that a chair could somehow</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.910" end="00:08:50.010" style="s2">start to impose a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:53.339" style="s2">organization on wood so that it started</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.010" end="00:08:56.130" style="s2">to turn itself into a chair that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.339" end="00:08:59.910" style="s2">a living thing does I mean you you food</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.130" end="00:09:03.410" style="s2">food is potential you you put food into</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.910" end="00:09:05.809" style="s2">you you inform it there is a code</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.410" end="00:09:08.209" style="s2">in your DNA that ultimately puts a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.809" end="00:09:10.459" style="s2">particular form in it that gives it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.209" end="00:09:12.829" style="s2">structural functional organization that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.459" end="00:09:15.499" style="s2">becomes you now of course this unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.829" end="00:09:17.119" style="s2">across time it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.499" end="00:09:21.349" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen like that and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.119" end="00:09:24.859" style="s2">we see it as change and development now</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.349" end="00:09:26.659" style="s2">this is really important as we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.859" end="00:09:29.029" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be foundational to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.659" end="00:09:36.259" style="s2">understanding a lot about how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.029" end="00:09:40.849" style="s2">connect to the world so how are we going</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.259" end="00:09:43.039" style="s2">to make use of this in talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.849" end="00:09:46.069" style="s2">way human beings are connected to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.039" end="00:09:49.249" style="s2">reality the way they develop and grow as</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.069" end="00:09:51.919" style="s2">cognitive agents so what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.249" end="00:09:54.739" style="s2">first is to step aside from Aristotle in</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.919" end="00:09:57.409" style="s2">the axial age and move into current</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.739" end="00:10:00.019" style="s2">cognitive science and talk about an</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.409" end="00:10:03.679" style="s2">important way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.019" end="00:10:05.689" style="s2">development and change especially the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.679" end="00:10:08.259" style="s2">work of Alicia Arara that was directly</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.689" end="00:10:13.069" style="s2">and explicitly inspired by this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.259" end="00:10:17.929" style="s2">Aristotelian framework so when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.069" end="00:10:21.739" style="s2">about how things change right we often</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.929" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">have a model that we inherited from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.739" end="00:10:26.209" style="s2">Scientific Revolution a model we get</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:29.079" style="s2">from Newton and this is a model that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.209" end="00:10:31.819" style="s2">change occurs because of causal impact</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.079" end="00:10:36.259" style="s2">so the standard thing it here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.819" end="00:10:39.289" style="s2">marker right I press it why did it move</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.259" end="00:10:43.729" style="s2">it moved because I pushed it it seems so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.289" end="00:10:47.329" style="s2">obvious and non-controversial right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.729" end="00:10:51.439" style="s2">we give an explanation what causes it to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.329" end="00:10:55.759" style="s2">be because it was pushed it was and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.439" end="00:10:58.639" style="s2">idea of all change and development is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.759" end="00:11:02.359" style="s2">there&#39;s an event a and it&#39;s some how</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.639" end="00:11:06.019" style="s2">right causes event B it causes event C</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.359" end="00:11:11.490" style="s2">event a precedes B makes B happen and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.019" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">then B precedes C and B makes C happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.490" end="00:11:18.130" style="s2">so as Newton was engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:20.350" style="s2">Scientific Revolution this notion of how</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.130" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">things happen was becoming prominent in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.350" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">him and for the people that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:28.300" style="s2">take up the Newtonian worldview and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:33.459" style="s2">was very interesting about that right is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.300" end="00:11:36.700" style="s2">that this seemed to solve a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.459" end="00:11:40.360" style="s2">problems and this was brought out by a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.700" end="00:11:42.190" style="s2">famous philosopher Immanuel Kant who the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.360" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">lessee Oro talks about Khan was</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.190" end="00:11:47.140" style="s2">interested in why was this Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">model becoming so successful the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.140" end="00:11:50.050" style="s2">Aristotelian model had been around for</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:54.820" style="s2">thousands of years why was Newton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.050" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">model overtaking it so rapidly and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.820" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">Kant said is well this does something</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:01.510" style="s2">very wonderful for us because what it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:04.950" style="s2">does is gives us a very simple account</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.510" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">of how we explain things I explained C</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.950" end="00:12:10.750" style="s2">by showing you how it was preceded by an</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:14.190" style="s2">event B that caused it and he&#39;ll be was</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.750" end="00:12:17.770" style="s2">preceded by an event a that caused it</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.190" end="00:12:18.970" style="s2">very nice linear clean and we like it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.770" end="00:12:22.200" style="s2">seems it really isn&#39;t that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.970" end="00:12:24.579" style="s2">happening so obvious all right and again</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.200" end="00:12:26.890" style="s2">remember again and again I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.579" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">show you things that seem so obvious so</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.890" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">natural are actually historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">creations you have to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:37.320" style="s2">how we got where we are now why does</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:42.730" style="s2">this matter well because this prevents a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.320" end="00:12:44.829" style="s2">kind of vacuous explanation that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.730" end="00:12:48.060" style="s2">occur this prevents what are called</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.829" end="00:12:52.290" style="s2">circular explanations this line right</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.060" end="00:12:52.290" style="s2">prevents circular explanations</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:13:02.010" style="s2">okay so circular explanation is when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.850" end="00:13:05.880" style="s2">assume the very thing you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.010" end="00:13:07.890" style="s2">explain in your explanation so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.880" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">standard kind of model people often use</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.890" end="00:13:11.820" style="s2">this without realizing you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">a triangle out here in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.820" end="00:13:16.140" style="s2">light comes in into my eye that goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:18.210" style="s2">through new earth pulses that goes into</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.140" end="00:13:20.580" style="s2">my consciousness right it&#39;s somehow</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.210" end="00:13:21.780" style="s2">projected onto an inner screen and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.580" end="00:13:24.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a triangle there and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.780" end="00:13:28.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a little man inside and he goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.510" end="00:13:30.270" style="s2">triangle right and we have updated</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.860" end="00:13:32.310" style="s2">versions of this like the Central</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.270" end="00:13:34.860" style="s2">Executive and such right this is called</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.310" end="00:13:37.410" style="s2">a homunculus eerie homunculus means a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.860" end="00:13:39.270" style="s2">little man now when you present it like</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.410" end="00:13:41.520" style="s2">that I hope you can all see why this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.270" end="00:13:42.750" style="s2">obviously useless because what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.520" end="00:13:44.190" style="s2">should then ask is well how does the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.750" end="00:13:46.350" style="s2">little man see the little triangle</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.190" end="00:13:48.630" style="s2">inside and then what you go is well</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.350" end="00:13:50.970" style="s2">inside the little man&#39;s head there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.630" end="00:13:54.750" style="s2">even smaller screen with a littler man</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.970" end="00:13:56.400" style="s2">going triangle but how does he see you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.750" end="00:13:58.200" style="s2">you see what this is it&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.400" end="00:14:01.500" style="s2">regress because you&#39;re actually using</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.200" end="00:14:02.700" style="s2">vision to try and explain vision now</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.500" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">please remember this notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.700" end="00:14:07.980" style="s2">homunculus II cuz that&#39;s what this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:09.900" style="s2">because well it&#39;s easy to explain I need</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:11.940" style="s2">you to understand that we fall into it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.900" end="00:14:15.320" style="s2">very often when we try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:18.090" style="s2">and explain ourselves okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.320" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">that is a circular explanation because</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.090" end="00:14:21.870" style="s2">you&#39;re using the very thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:24.420" style="s2">trying to explain in order to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.870" end="00:14:26.340" style="s2">Kant said this Newtonian scheme is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.420" end="00:14:28.530" style="s2">wonderful because if you stick to its</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.340" end="00:14:30.780" style="s2">grammar of you sticks to its rules the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.530" end="00:14:35.420" style="s2">cars has to be an independent event that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.780" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">proceeds right then you don&#39;t fall into</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.420" end="00:14:41.400" style="s2">circular explanations that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:46.230" style="s2">now you&#39;ve got some problems here what</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.400" end="00:14:49.260" style="s2">started it all right right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.230" end="00:14:50.520" style="s2">maybe God and then Khan says no and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.260" end="00:14:52.590" style="s2">got all his arguments when I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:14:55.470" style="s2">to get into that right now suffice it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.590" end="00:14:57.810" style="s2">say that this became a predominant way</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.470" end="00:15:00.780" style="s2">of trying to explain how things work but</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.810" end="00:15:03.960" style="s2">then Kant encountered a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.780" end="00:15:06.600" style="s2">problem and it&#39;s it&#39;s and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.960" end="00:15:08.220" style="s2">coincidence and it has to do with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.220" end="00:15:12.630" style="s2">with Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.970" end="00:15:14.670" style="s2">the kinds of things that can grow living</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.630" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">things because Conn went out and he saw</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.670" end="00:15:20.220" style="s2">a tree right and this was very</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:24.420" style="s2">problematic for him because trees don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.220" end="00:15:25.830" style="s2">follow this model readily because he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.420" end="00:15:29.250" style="s2">looking at it was saying okay well</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.830" end="00:15:31.200" style="s2">what&#39;s making the tree well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.250" end="00:15:34.380" style="s2">sunlight well how does the Sun like get</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.200" end="00:15:36.540" style="s2">in through the leaves so right what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.380" end="00:15:37.740" style="s2">making the leaves well the tree so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.540" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">tree makes the leaves and the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.740" end="00:15:44.630" style="s2">make the tree so the tree is making the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.350" end="00:15:50.010" style="s2">tree and he coined the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.630" end="00:15:53.430" style="s2">self-organizing the tree is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.010" end="00:15:56.550" style="s2">self-organizing now the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.430" end="00:16:04.950" style="s2">that is right living things make use of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.550" end="00:16:06.900" style="s2">feedback cycles in a feedback cycle the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.950" end="00:16:09.630" style="s2">output from the system feeds back into</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.900" end="00:16:11.490" style="s2">the system the tree makes the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:15.240" style="s2">that gathers energy that goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.490" end="00:16:17.550" style="s2">processes that makes the leaves living</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.240" end="00:16:20.700" style="s2">things are self-organizing they use</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.550" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">feedback cycles but when I try and give</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.700" end="00:16:28.950" style="s2">an explanation of a feedback cycle I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">fall into a circular explanation I fall</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.950" end="00:16:37.350" style="s2">into a circular explanation and so Kourt</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.790" style="s2">came to a rather startling conclusion he</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.350" end="00:16:40.980" style="s2">came to the conclusion that there could</p>

<p begin="00:16:40.980" end="00:16:48.540" style="s2">biology was impossible now Cantus one is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.110" end="00:16:51.330" style="s2">a towering intellect is like he&#39;s a gene</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.540" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">is a philosophical genius and so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.330" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">can&#39;t just sort of dismiss that K well</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:57.390" style="s2">there obviously is biology what an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">conscious no no you&#39;re the one who needs</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.390" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">to step back and think where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">mistake in the argument because if there</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:09.660" style="s2">is biology and it&#39;s true that there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:12.180" style="s2">and I agree that there is right and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.660" end="00:17:14.270" style="s2">living things use feedback cycles which</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.180" end="00:17:16.470" style="s2">they necessarily do they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.270" end="00:17:19.530" style="s2">self-organizing which they necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.470" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">are and when I try and trace out the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.530" end="00:17:22.260" style="s2">causation I get into circular</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.630" end="00:17:24.449" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.260" end="00:17:27.030" style="s2">which seems like a necessary thing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.449" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">circular explanations are vacuous and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.030" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">empty then where&#39;s caught going wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.900" end="00:17:38.309" style="s2">this is what your yer ro takes up and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.660" end="00:17:40.049" style="s2">she said actually for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.309" end="00:17:44.610" style="s2">we had no way of solving this problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.049" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">and so there was a huge gap between our</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.610" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">biology and our physics now again why</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:53.460" style="s2">are we caring about this because we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:54.330" style="s2">to if we&#39;re going to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.460" end="00:17:56.429" style="s2">Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.330" end="00:17:59.270" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna deeply understand what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.429" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">mean when we talk about that we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.270" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">living things that grow and develop and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:06.299" style="s2">that growth and development is integral</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:09.390" style="s2">to our meaning and our sense of who and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.299" end="00:18:12.690" style="s2">what we are our personal identity that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.390" end="00:18:16.620" style="s2">if we cannot give an answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:19.530" style="s2">problem we cannot understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.620" end="00:18:22.230" style="s2">fundamentally who and what we are and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.530" end="00:18:24.120" style="s2">what the hell we are talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.230" end="00:18:27.030" style="s2">we talk about how important growth and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.120" end="00:18:29.309" style="s2">development are to us because that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.030" end="00:18:34.760" style="s2">language will forever be separate from</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.309" end="00:18:40.130" style="s2">any kind of scientific understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.760" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">where&#39;s this going wrong this seems just</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.130" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">like living things our feedback cycles</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:51.960" style="s2">self-organizing they grow they develop</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:56.280" style="s2">they they make themselves right so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.960" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">what has to go well this now before you</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.280" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">jump with it but that&#39;s just that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.020" end="00:19:02.690" style="s2">what causation is think about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:06.750" style="s2">that we know we actually know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.690" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">Newton&#39;s ultimately wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.750" end="00:19:12.110" style="s2">Newton doesn&#39;t work with relativity</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:14.580" style="s2">Newton doesn&#39;t work at the quantum level</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.110" end="00:19:18.710" style="s2">so we know that we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.580" end="00:19:21.690" style="s2">absolutely committed to this view now</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.710" end="00:19:24.360" style="s2">your ro actually makes use of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.690" end="00:19:29.179" style="s2">important idea from Aristotle to solve</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.360" end="00:19:29.179" style="s2">this problem so</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.190" end="00:19:38.870" style="s2">she&#39;s going to use Aristotle in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.620" end="00:19:41.000" style="s2">explain in a new and powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.870" end="00:19:43.100" style="s2">talking about growth and development and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.000" end="00:19:48.800" style="s2">self-organizing processes which is known</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.100" end="00:19:51.820" style="s2">as dynamical Systems Theory so aro first</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.800" end="00:19:57.650" style="s2">of all makes a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.820" end="00:19:59.900" style="s2">causes and constraints so to get at that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.650" end="00:20:05.930" style="s2">distinction let&#39;s go back to what seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.900" end="00:20:07.310" style="s2">so obvious okay here&#39;s the marker I push</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.930" end="00:20:09.470" style="s2">it why did it move</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.310" end="00:20:11.450" style="s2">and immediately the Newtonian grammar</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.470" end="00:20:12.980" style="s2">just comes into place it moved because</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.450" end="00:20:15.380" style="s2">you pushed it and then you might step</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.980" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">out outside of physics and say well I</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.380" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">wanted to push it and the Dodson that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:21.920" style="s2">not what I&#39;m asking because it right it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.860" style="s2">could also just be that some other</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.920" end="00:20:30.260" style="s2">object bumped into this and it moved why</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.860" end="00:20:33.680" style="s2">else did it move okay so think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.260" end="00:20:37.210" style="s2">what has to also be true in order for</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.680" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">this to move there has to be empty space</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.210" end="00:20:41.630" style="s2">relatively empty space in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:42.710" style="s2">marker this has to have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.630" end="00:20:46.100" style="s2">shape to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.710" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">this has to have a particular shape to</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2">those aren&#39;t events right those are</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.850" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">constraints right aren&#39;t events they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:15.910" style="s2">they make things possible and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.110" end="00:21:19.960" style="s2">big difference between a condition and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.910" end="00:21:22.840" style="s2">an event the Newtonian way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.960" end="00:21:26.530" style="s2">has us so fixated on this so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.840" end="00:21:31.240" style="s2">foregrounded on this that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.530" end="00:21:34.780" style="s2">seeing this anymore BC Aristotle because</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.240" end="00:21:37.510" style="s2">of his platonic view actually considers</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.780" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">this more important why because when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.510" end="00:21:42.460" style="s2">talk about a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:46.510" style="s2">organization when I talk about a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.460" end="00:21:50.020" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about this this is where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.510" end="00:21:55.090" style="s2">will find form this is where sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.020" end="00:21:56.860" style="s2">called the formal cause this is where</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.090" end="00:21:59.700" style="s2">you&#39;ll find the structural functional</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.050" end="00:22:10.090" style="s2">right conditions are structurally</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.090" end="00:22:19.570" style="s2">for this is possible now this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.630" end="00:22:22.870" style="s2">important because this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.570" end="00:22:27.510" style="s2">actuality and this is where we get</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.870" end="00:22:29.770" style="s2">potentiality when I shape possibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.510" end="00:22:32.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean when I say something</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.770" end="00:22:37.270" style="s2">is potential I mean that possibility has</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.770" end="00:22:39.970" style="s2">been shaped by constraints so that these</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.270" end="00:22:42.700" style="s2">events are more possible than these</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.970" end="00:22:44.170" style="s2">events okay so we&#39;re going to do more</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.700" end="00:22:47.050" style="s2">but let&#39;s stop here and let&#39;s see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.170" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">this is already starting to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.050" end="00:22:52.450" style="s2">problem of talking about the tree and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:55.950" style="s2">it&#39;s self-organization so in a tree</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.450" end="00:23:00.430" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a bunch of events happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.950" end="00:23:02.910" style="s2">biochemical events what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.430" end="00:23:07.300" style="s2">they&#39;re actually causing a particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.910" end="00:23:10.570" style="s2">right form or formula or structural</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.300" end="00:23:12.580" style="s2">functional organization now think about</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.570" end="00:23:15.550" style="s2">it why do trees grow the way they do why</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.580" end="00:23:17.140" style="s2">do they grow like this why do they</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.550" end="00:23:19.300" style="s2">spread out their branches why do their</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.140" end="00:23:22.660" style="s2">leaves spread out because what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.300" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">trying to do is they&#39;re trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.660" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">the possibility of a photon hitting a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">chlorophyll molecule the structure of</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.010" end="00:23:39.850" style="s2">events so the events right cause this</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.130" end="00:23:46.510" style="s2">structure and then right they cause it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.850" end="00:23:48.760" style="s2">but this then constrains the events so</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.510" end="00:23:52.030" style="s2">look at me I&#39;m a living thing I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.760" end="00:23:53.530" style="s2">bunch of events happening in me and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:56.290" style="s2">creates a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.530" end="00:23:58.630" style="s2">organization that organization creates</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.290" end="00:24:01.090" style="s2">an internal environment in which the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.630" end="00:24:03.130" style="s2">probability of events is dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.090" end="00:24:04.990" style="s2">altered so events that have very low</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.130" end="00:24:06.970" style="s2">probability happening out there have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.990" end="00:24:08.260" style="s2">high probability of happening in here</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.970" end="00:24:10.300" style="s2">and events that have a very high</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.260" end="00:24:12.190" style="s2">probability of happening out there have</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.300" end="00:24:13.660" style="s2">a very low probability of happening in</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.190" end="00:24:17.920" style="s2">here and that&#39;s what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.660" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">living thing the events right cause a</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:23.770" style="s2">a structural functional organization and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:28.420" style="s2">I das a form and then that constrains</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.770" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">the events now this is not a circular</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.420" end="00:24:33.280" style="s2">explanation because I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">two very different kinds of things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.280" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">talking about actuality and potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.920" end="00:24:44.770" style="s2">now it&#39;s important to realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.490" end="00:24:45.880" style="s2">discussion of possibility many of you</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.770" end="00:24:48.309" style="s2">were saying oh this is like ah so</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.880" end="00:24:51.940" style="s2">abstract and what does this this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.309" end="00:24:54.270" style="s2">actually integral to science okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.940" end="00:24:56.950" style="s2">science depends on there being real</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.270" end="00:25:01.330" style="s2">potential the potentiality is a real</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.950" end="00:25:03.190" style="s2">thing all right so you know here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.330" end="00:25:05.950" style="s2">object moving around all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.190" end="00:25:07.990" style="s2">it&#39;s on the ground look at all this</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:10.900" style="s2">kinetic energy look at it moving look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.990" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">oh it stopped did I destroy all that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.900" end="00:25:15.070" style="s2">energy where did the kinetic energy go</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">you can&#39;t destroy energy</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.070" end="00:25:20.950" style="s2">well the kinetic energy has become</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:22.809" style="s2">potential energy if the principle of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:25.450" style="s2">conservation of mass and energy is real</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.809" end="00:25:27.540" style="s2">then potentiality is real look at this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.450" end="00:25:30.730" style="s2">look at look at something from Newton</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.540" end="00:25:33.580" style="s2">force equals mass times acceleration is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.730" end="00:25:35.710" style="s2">that an event is that oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.580" end="00:25:37.870" style="s2">happening over there right now was it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.710" end="00:25:42.660" style="s2">it that does it happen every Tuesday at</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.870" end="00:25:45.790" style="s2">4 o&#39;clock this isn&#39;t an event this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.660" end="00:25:49.740" style="s2">right how things are shaped it puts a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.790" end="00:25:54.040" style="s2">limit on what&#39;s possible in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.740" end="00:25:56.380" style="s2">talking about real potentiality is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.040" end="00:25:58.840" style="s2">talking fictional or abstract it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.380" end="00:26:03.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of talking that&#39;s integral to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.840" end="00:26:03.090" style="s2">our current science ok</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.290" end="00:26:11.110" style="s2">we&#39;re still not done though because your</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.220" end="00:26:13.390" style="s2">ro points out that there are two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.110" end="00:26:15.850" style="s2">of constraints so our explanations can</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.390" end="00:26:20.500" style="s2">become even more refined there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.850" end="00:26:23.020" style="s2">constraints that make a form of event a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.500" end="00:26:30.700" style="s2">type of event more possible she calls</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.020" end="00:26:33.250" style="s2">those enabling constraints right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.700" end="00:26:35.680" style="s2">then there are constraints that reduce</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.250" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">the possibilities reduce the options for</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.680" end="00:26:40.770" style="s2">a system these are the selected or</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:40.770" style="s2">selective constraints</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.490" end="00:26:52.140" style="s2">now this is going to give us a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.660" end="00:26:57.550" style="s2">powerful way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.140" end="00:27:00.760" style="s2">development let&#39;s use it the way yarrow</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.550" end="00:27:03.040" style="s2">does to talk about one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.760" end="00:27:06.520" style="s2">significant theories of development and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.040" end="00:27:09.310" style="s2">change one of the great hallmarks of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.520" end="00:27:11.350" style="s2">science in fact it&#39;s a foundational</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.310" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">theory for the science of biology which</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.350" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">of course is the theory of natural</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">selection its theory of Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:19.450" style="s2">evolution because the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:21.850" style="s2">Darwinian evolution is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.450" end="00:27:25.090" style="s2">first dynamical Systems theory in</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.850" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">science and it is a theory that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.090" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">designed precisely to account for growth</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:32.170" style="s2">and development obviously they are not</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:35.560" style="s2">within an individual but across</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.170" end="00:27:38.380" style="s2">speciation ok so let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.560" end="00:27:39.880" style="s2">the theory so what you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.380" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">first of all there has to be a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.880" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">cycle for right any dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:49.150" style="s2">theory because we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:50.800" style="s2">process that&#39;s self-organizing so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.150" end="00:27:52.030" style="s2">the feedback cycle that evolution talks</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.800" end="00:27:55.060" style="s2">about of course well it&#39;s sexual</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.030" end="00:28:00.400" style="s2">reproduction where the dotes come from</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.060" end="00:28:02.590" style="s2">other goats goats are produced there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.400" end="00:28:04.450" style="s2">the product and then it feeds back into</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.590" end="00:28:06.730" style="s2">the system and becomes the producer</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.450" end="00:28:08.140" style="s2">makes more goats that make more goats</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.730" end="00:28:12.550" style="s2">that makes more goats that&#39;s why we call</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.140" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">it reproduction it&#39;s a feedback cycle so</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.550" end="00:28:18.400" style="s2">what did Darwin realize well he realized</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:19.680" style="s2">that there were selective constraints</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.400" end="00:28:23.890" style="s2">operating on that there were conditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.680" end="00:28:28.390" style="s2">in the environment that reduced the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.890" end="00:28:30.430" style="s2">options for organism that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.390" end="00:28:32.890" style="s2">what&#39;s those conditions scarcity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.430" end="00:28:37.390" style="s2">resources okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.890" end="00:28:39.340" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been looking at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.390" end="00:28:41.290" style="s2">theories of early life and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.340" end="00:28:42.970" style="s2">argument by several biologists that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.290" end="00:28:44.470" style="s2">there&#39;s no evolution for about probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.970" end="00:28:47.050" style="s2">eight hundred thousand years or so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.470" end="00:28:49.900" style="s2">because there&#39;s no scarcity of resources</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.050" end="00:28:52.770" style="s2">with my first of all so life is static</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.900" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">because there&#39;s no scarcity of resources</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.770" end="00:28:58.270" style="s2">scarcity of resources means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:29:00.120" style="s2">competition scarcity of resources means</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.270" end="00:29:03.330" style="s2">not everything can live</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.120" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">and so that reduces the options for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.330" end="00:29:14.100" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:16.140" style="s2">okay so selection reducing options but</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.100" end="00:29:17.570" style="s2">that&#39;s not all that&#39;s going on right if</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.140" end="00:29:20.100" style="s2">that was the case everything would die</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.570" end="00:29:22.919" style="s2">evolution would end I mean you know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:25.500" style="s2">that can happen extinction events but</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.919" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something else there&#39;s enabling</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.500" end="00:29:38.700" style="s2">constraints that open up the system open</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:42.350" style="s2">up the options so look around look at me</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.700" end="00:29:47.990" style="s2">look at other people there&#39;s variation</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.350" end="00:29:53.390" style="s2">there&#39;s considerable variation variation</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.990" end="00:29:53.390" style="s2">increases the options</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.300" end="00:30:05.880" style="s2">so look what&#39;s going on here you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.450" end="00:30:08.940" style="s2">this feedback cycle as its as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.880" end="00:30:11.730" style="s2">cycling through you&#39;ve got the selective</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.940" end="00:30:14.700" style="s2">conditions reducing the options that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.730" end="00:30:15.870" style="s2">available and then the variation opening</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.700" end="00:30:17.930" style="s2">in them up you can think of it almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.870" end="00:30:21.570" style="s2">like an accordion model the variation</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.930" end="00:30:23.910" style="s2">opens it up and then as it cycles the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.570" end="00:30:26.790" style="s2">selective constraint pushes it down and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.910" end="00:30:29.040" style="s2">then from there it opens up again and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.790" end="00:30:30.600" style="s2">then it gets pushed back down and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.040" end="00:30:33.470" style="s2">it opens up again and gets pushed back</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.600" end="00:30:37.260" style="s2">down and as it cycles like this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.470" end="00:30:39.330" style="s2">constantly changing in a way to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.260" end="00:30:42.270" style="s2">better fitted to the environment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.330" end="00:30:44.850" style="s2">evolution right it&#39;s a kind of circular</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.270" end="00:30:50.580" style="s2">evolve is related to words like revolve</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.850" end="00:30:52.920" style="s2">it&#39;s this revolution with change now</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.580" end="00:30:54.660" style="s2">notice what I&#39;m trying to get you to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.920" end="00:30:56.160" style="s2">is like first of all this is important I</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.660" end="00:30:58.200" style="s2">mean I wish I was Charles Darwin this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.160" end="00:31:00.330" style="s2">one of the great great theories he gets</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.200" end="00:31:03.270" style="s2">to sail around the world and what a life</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.330" end="00:31:05.070" style="s2">he gets to sail around the world go to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.270" end="00:31:07.640" style="s2">some amazing places and then he comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.070" end="00:31:11.150" style="s2">back and makes a world-changing theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.640" end="00:31:13.530" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing but notice how much this</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.150" end="00:31:18.350" style="s2">Darwinian theory that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.530" end="00:31:22.050" style="s2">foundation of biology how much it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.350" end="00:31:27.270" style="s2">beholden to Aristotle how much it</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.050" end="00:31:28.650" style="s2">depends on Aristotelian ideas okay now</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.650" end="00:31:33.650" style="s2">talks about this as a virtual governor</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.740" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">so a governor is right there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.560" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">device that sort of limits what you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:45.330" style="s2">do on a system like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:48.450" style="s2">governor on a steam-engine right</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.330" end="00:31:50.700" style="s2">it sets the range it limits the range at</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.450" end="00:31:52.260" style="s2">which you can cycle she calls it a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.700" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">virtual governor because it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.260" end="00:31:57.930" style="s2">actual machine it&#39;s the shaping of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:59.820" style="s2">possibility she stops there and work</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.930" end="00:32:01.560" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done with Leah Ferraro and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.820" end="00:32:03.930" style="s2">Anderson Todd and Richard we think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.560" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">should you should continue to finish the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.930" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">metaphor this is a virtual generator</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.330" end="00:32:12.950" style="s2">because it&#39;s a set of conditions that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:16.290" style="s2">are generating off</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.950" end="00:32:22.850" style="s2">for a self-organizing system and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.290" end="00:32:22.850" style="s2">the idea when you put a virtual governor</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.330" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">systematically together with a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.350" end="00:32:33.660" style="s2">generator such that you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:40.470" style="s2">systematically regulating a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.660" end="00:32:44.270" style="s2">cycle this whole thing is a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.470" end="00:32:44.270" style="s2">engine because when you attach a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.420" end="00:32:48.390" style="s2">governor to a generator you get a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.010" end="00:32:50.670" style="s2">virtual engine so this is what a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.390" end="00:32:53.070" style="s2">dynamical system theory is a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.670" end="00:32:56.460" style="s2">system theory is basically a theory that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.070" end="00:32:59.370" style="s2">lays out the virtual engine it shows you</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.460" end="00:33:02.100" style="s2">how there&#39;s a feedback cycle and why</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.370" end="00:33:04.230" style="s2">that&#39;s not just random and chaotic why</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.100" end="00:33:06.780" style="s2">it produces growth and development</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.230" end="00:33:09.090" style="s2">precisely because there&#39;s a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.780" end="00:33:14.250" style="s2">relationship between a set of enabling</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.090" end="00:33:17.370" style="s2">and selective constraints now all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.250" end="00:33:21.660" style="s2">this is very very Aristotelian so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.370" end="00:33:23.910" style="s2">now take it back to Aristotle because</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.660" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">Aristotle was interested now he he</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.910" end="00:33:27.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t use this he doesn&#39;t use the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:30.150" style="s2">dynamical systems language that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.960" end="00:33:33.800" style="s2">language but this language too was</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.150" end="00:33:36.990" style="s2">directly inspired by powered by</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.800" end="00:33:39.180" style="s2">Aristotle so using it backwards to try</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.990" end="00:33:40.830" style="s2">and connect Aristotle to a current</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.180" end="00:33:46.020" style="s2">understanding I do not think is</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.830" end="00:33:49.920" style="s2">anachronistic so Aristotle is interested</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.020" end="00:33:51.480" style="s2">in our development he&#39;s going to add</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.920" end="00:33:52.860" style="s2">something that was missing from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.480" end="00:33:54.690" style="s2">Socratic notion of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.860" end="00:33:57.270" style="s2">remember the Socratic notion was trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.690" end="00:33:57.870" style="s2">to overcome self-deception and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.270" end="00:34:00.990" style="s2">Plato</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.870" end="00:34:02.670" style="s2">adds a whole structural theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.990" end="00:34:04.680" style="s2">psyche to explain how we overcome</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.670" end="00:34:07.920" style="s2">self-deception how we become wise and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.680" end="00:34:11.010" style="s2">achieve wisdom but what&#39;s missing in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.920" end="00:34:12.900" style="s2">account of wisdom and meaning according</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.010" end="00:34:15.150" style="s2">to Aristotle if I can use this language</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.900" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">as what&#39;s missing is an account of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.150" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">growth and development</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:23.400" style="s2">how does wisdom develop how does meaning</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:25.290" style="s2">develop well this is where we get</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.400" end="00:34:29.740" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.290" end="00:34:36.790" style="s2">that we talk about and we use as in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.740" end="00:34:39.420" style="s2">language but we don&#39;t I think get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.790" end="00:34:41.800" style="s2">depth of what Aristotle is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.420" end="00:34:44.590" style="s2">there&#39;s an aspect of who and what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.800" end="00:34:46.930" style="s2">are that&#39;s fundamentally connected to</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.590" end="00:34:49.090" style="s2">your projects of meaning and your</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.930" end="00:34:52.180" style="s2">project of wisdom you often it might</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.090" end="00:34:53.920" style="s2">have used this term or related terms but</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.180" end="00:34:55.840" style="s2">do you really know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.920" end="00:35:02.140" style="s2">about and this is the notion of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.840" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">character now first of all your</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.140" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2">character isn&#39;t your personality because</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:06.820" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to use these terms</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:09.400" style="s2">strictly you&#39;re born with your</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.820" end="00:35:12.190" style="s2">personality personality is part of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.400" end="00:35:14.170" style="s2">just your general Constitution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.190" end="00:35:16.450" style="s2">what&#39;s given to you by the biology and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.170" end="00:35:20.410" style="s2">the environment that you have no choice</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.450" end="00:35:23.410" style="s2">over right but your character is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.410" end="00:35:24.940" style="s2">aspect of you that you can cultivate now</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.410" end="00:35:29.230" style="s2">you can either cultivate it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.940" end="00:35:34.950" style="s2">unconsciously surreptitiously indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.230" end="00:35:34.950" style="s2">or you can cultivate it more explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.130" end="00:35:40.450" style="s2">but what is your character when we say</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.950" end="00:35:42.580" style="s2">that somebody&#39;s acting out of character</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.450" end="00:35:44.020" style="s2">we&#39;re usually making and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.580" end="00:35:46.090" style="s2">important we&#39;re usually making either an</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.020" end="00:35:48.820" style="s2">existential or moral criticism of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.090" end="00:35:51.010" style="s2">when we say Peter is acting out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.820" end="00:35:54.490" style="s2">character we often will mean something</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.010" end="00:35:56.050" style="s2">like he&#39;s normally honest he&#39;s normally</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.490" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">honest he normally has the virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.050" end="00:36:02.110" style="s2">honest notice the connection here by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:04.500" style="s2">way virtue and we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.110" end="00:36:08.410" style="s2">a virtual engine that is not</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.990" end="00:36:14.650" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about again a set of</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.650" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">systematically in somebody now that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.050" end="00:36:20.860" style="s2">points to something that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:23.230" style="s2">about character I&#39;m gonna suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.860" end="00:36:27.240" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is what is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:27.240" style="s2">virtual engine on a person&#39;s development</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.140" end="00:36:37.669" style="s2">what system of constraints have you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.479" end="00:36:40.809" style="s2">identified with and what system of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.669" end="00:36:44.390" style="s2">constraints have you internalized that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.809" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">regulate the development that&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.390" end="00:36:51.140" style="s2">ask a Socratic question let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:53.900" style="s2">something that Socrates would do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.140" end="00:36:57.829" style="s2">spend a lot of time on our appearance we</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.900" end="00:37:01.609" style="s2">spend a lot of time on our status how</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.829" end="00:37:08.199" style="s2">much time did you spend today on your</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.609" end="00:37:08.199" style="s2">character how much</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.740" end="00:37:16.680" style="s2">if it is the virtual engine that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.680" end="00:37:18.940" style="s2">regulating your growth and development</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.680" end="00:37:25.230" style="s2">you should be of course spending a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.940" end="00:37:25.230" style="s2">of time on your character but are you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.480" end="00:37:35.589" style="s2">now Aristotle proposed ways of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.900" end="00:37:37.540" style="s2">cultivate your character I I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.589" end="00:37:39.820" style="s2">that his method his famous method of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.540" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">golden mean is a way of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.820" end="00:37:44.680" style="s2">you to set up conditions to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:47.380" style="s2">your character so for example what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.680" end="00:37:49.290" style="s2">courage we would all like to be more</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.380" end="00:37:52.450" style="s2">courageous they take it</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.290" end="00:37:54.730" style="s2">well Aristotle proposed that it falls</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.450" end="00:37:57.730" style="s2">it&#39;s the golden mean not the average</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.730" end="00:38:00.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a misunderstanding right because</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.730" end="00:38:05.020" style="s2">it&#39;s golden mean between two things of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.760" end="00:38:09.010" style="s2">course you can be a coward you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.020" end="00:38:14.099" style="s2">somehow be defective by having a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.010" end="00:38:17.050" style="s2">deficiency but you can also be foolhardy</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.099" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">right just running into traffic doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.050" end="00:38:25.060" style="s2">make you courageous what you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:27.339" style="s2">trying to do is you&#39;re trying to set up</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.060" end="00:38:30.190" style="s2">a system where you&#39;re paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.339" end="00:38:31.900" style="s2">when you lack the enabling constraints</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.900" end="00:38:37.900" style="s2">and also conditions when you lack the</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.750" end="00:41:36.670" style="s2">Aristotle points out there&#39;s a deep form</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.400" end="00:41:44.020" style="s2">of foolishness that comes from a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.670" end="00:41:46.330" style="s2">character calls it a crazy which we</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.020" end="00:41:48.070" style="s2">poorly translate as weakness of the will</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.330" end="00:41:49.480" style="s2">because we&#39;re all post Protestants and</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.490" end="00:41:55.630" style="s2">scientific evidence that the notion of</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.640" end="00:42:06.630" style="s2">right thing to do is and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.990" style="s2">this remember with the chocolate cake</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.630" end="00:42:12.359" style="s2">but you don&#39;t do the right thing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.990" end="00:42:15.340" style="s2">here&#39;s where we can sort of put</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.359" end="00:42:17.470" style="s2">Aristotle and Plato together Plato gives</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.340" end="00:42:22.210" style="s2">us the sort of story about how we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.470" end="00:42:24.040" style="s2">to structure the psyche but Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.210" end="00:42:26.200" style="s2">gives us a much more penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.040" end="00:42:28.839" style="s2">analysis of what that structural</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.200" end="00:42:30.190" style="s2">functional organization is here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:33.010" style="s2">era thought it would say why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.190" end="00:42:34.270" style="s2">behaving foolishly ignorance is when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.010" end="00:42:37.030" style="s2">do the wrong thing because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.270" end="00:42:38.349" style="s2">know part of what foolishness is is when</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.030" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">you know what the right thing is and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.349" end="00:42:43.270" style="s2">still do the wrong thing here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:44.770" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s answer you do the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.270" end="00:42:47.589" style="s2">thing because although you have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.770" end="00:42:50.710" style="s2">right beliefs and notice the again the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.589" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">impotence of belief here you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.710" end="00:42:58.170" style="s2">the right you don&#39;t have sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:43:00.910" style="s2">character you have not trained things</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.170" end="00:43:02.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve not trained skills you&#39;ve not</p>

<p begin="00:43:02.770" end="00:43:09.450" style="s2">created a virtual engine that is</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.450" end="00:43:16.420" style="s2">such that you will live up to your</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.270" end="00:43:29.560" style="s2">right thing so we&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.770" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">again the deep grammar of what we talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.560" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">about when we talk about meaning</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.270" end="00:43:43.530" style="s2">and we notice now that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.730" end="00:43:46.290" style="s2">developmental aspect to it what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.530" end="00:43:49.980" style="s2">live up to your potential</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.290" end="00:43:51.330" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s a phrase we use what is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.980" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">you&#39;re saying when you say that about</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.330" end="00:44:04.650" style="s2">somebody why does it matter so much so</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:06.360" style="s2">Aristotle would say let&#39;s go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.650" end="00:44:08.100" style="s2">analogy please always remember that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.360" end="00:44:14.970" style="s2">Cinelli let&#39;s go back to the analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.100" end="00:44:17.270" style="s2">a man-made thing okay how is it when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.970" end="00:44:21.620" style="s2">know when something has been well made</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.270" end="00:44:29.810" style="s2">what makes it something a good knife</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.620" end="00:44:39.210" style="s2">right well when it has a structural</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.810" end="00:44:42.900" style="s2">functional organization right that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.210" end="00:44:46.080" style="s2">allows it to fulfill its purpose no</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.900" end="00:44:48.360" style="s2">knives are for cutting if I&#39;ve taken the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.080" end="00:44:50.010" style="s2">potential in the metal and organized at</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.360" end="00:44:51.840" style="s2">the right way structure to the right way</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.010" end="00:44:57.450" style="s2">it will actually function to cut very</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.840" end="00:45:01.170" style="s2">well right I noticed that this is a word</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.450" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">that&#39;s also deeply associated with our</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.170" end="00:45:10.920" style="s2">sense of what it is to have meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:12.840" style="s2">Aristotle asks well what can we do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.920" end="00:45:15.450" style="s2">this analogy human beings aren&#39;t made</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.840" end="00:45:18.330" style="s2">the way knives are made we&#39;re self</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.450" end="00:45:23.580" style="s2">making and here&#39;s here&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.330" end="00:45:26.030" style="s2">idea we&#39;re self making we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.580" end="00:45:28.620" style="s2">self organizing the term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.030" end="00:45:30.360" style="s2">Francisco Varela and Evan Thompson have</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.620" end="00:45:33.270" style="s2">generated to talk about this is we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.360" end="00:45:34.890" style="s2">autopoietic we are self making things so</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.270" end="00:45:37.320" style="s2">you&#39;re different from a tornado a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.890" end="00:45:41.360" style="s2">tornado is self organizing but a tornado</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.320" end="00:45:43.500" style="s2">will move its behavior can be rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.360" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">self-destructive it will move into</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.500" end="00:45:47.930" style="s2">conditions that destroy it your self</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">organized in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.930" end="00:45:51.800" style="s2">that you have a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:55.970" style="s2">organization that allows you to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.800" end="00:45:57.530" style="s2">conditions so the tornado does not seek</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.970" end="00:45:59.600" style="s2">out the conditions that will protect and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.530" end="00:46:02.690" style="s2">promote its own self organization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.600" end="00:46:05.000" style="s2">not self making you are self making so</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.690" end="00:46:06.710" style="s2">here&#39;s the interesting thing in and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.000" end="00:46:08.600" style="s2">is a brilliant idea that Eric pearl</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.710" end="00:46:11.810" style="s2">brings out in his book thinking being</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.600" end="00:46:13.430" style="s2">right in living things right the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.810" end="00:46:15.020" style="s2">of the thing is its structural</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.430" end="00:46:20.540" style="s2">functional organization it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.020" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">self making thing so what your what your</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.540" end="00:46:27.310" style="s2">purpose your function is is to enhance</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:30.590" style="s2">your structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.310" end="00:46:31.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh well let&#39;s this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.590" end="00:46:33.620" style="s2">problem you&#39;ll say with philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.970" end="00:46:36.200" style="s2">there&#39;s also abstract what does that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.620" end="00:46:39.740" style="s2">mean specifically well for Aristotle it</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.200" end="00:46:49.270" style="s2">means paying attention to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.740" end="00:46:49.270" style="s2">you are a rational reflective creature</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.480" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">you&#39;re unlike a plant a plant has this</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.830" end="00:47:03.740" style="s2">but all it basically does is actualize</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:05.780" style="s2">its ability to sort of digest so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.740" end="00:47:11.180" style="s2">take a look at this we have in organic</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.780" end="00:47:15.560" style="s2">matter right and then it gets a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.180" end="00:47:21.800" style="s2">particular it&#39;s informed and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.560" end="00:47:24.530" style="s2">like a living thing and that living</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.800" end="00:47:29.330" style="s2">things can get a more complex structure</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.530" end="00:47:32.780" style="s2">that make them self moving that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.330" end="00:47:36.790" style="s2">an animal is an animal isn&#39;t a mammal an</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.780" end="00:47:39.290" style="s2">animal is a self moving thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.790" end="00:47:40.790" style="s2">some of those self moving things have</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.290" end="00:47:43.460" style="s2">structural functional organizations</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.790" end="00:47:47.060" style="s2">here&#39;s in here for example that take</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.460" end="00:47:48.680" style="s2">that self moving and really actualize it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.060" end="00:47:50.930" style="s2">remember we talked about that the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.680" end="00:47:52.760" style="s2">psyche where we get our word psychology</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.930" end="00:47:55.130" style="s2">mind originally meant your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.760" end="00:47:56.750" style="s2">self moving and we claim to apply to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.130" end="00:47:58.820" style="s2">mind because the mind is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.750" end="00:48:02.230" style="s2">you that is the cell most self moving</p>
