<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">also will address some very</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">interesting intersections between the</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">moment but before we hop into that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">i&#39;d love ron to talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">how his family and his family&#39;s history</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">intersects the kibbutz movement</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">yeah so thanks again jim for having me</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:56.680" style="s2">my interest in the kibbutz really came</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.680" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">contradictions between my wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">experiences of the kibbutz growing up</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">and then my more skeptical self when i</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">grew up a little more i did not grow up</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">in the kibbutz but my entire life was</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">around the kibbutzi my grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">was the proud founder of wonky boots in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">the south and my</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">and she lived there for 55 years my</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">mother grew up there and left</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">my uncle and aunt still lived there my</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">brother lived there</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">so we would visit as children my brother</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">and i with the family my grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">every week and it was wonderful we love</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">the kibbutz you know a society that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">based on full</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">equal sharing at the time in the 70s it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">was this picturesque</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">village with green paths and swimming</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">pools and the dining hall</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.879" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">and we would play basketball and table</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">tennis we would wander around the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">kibbutz our parents didn&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">about us</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">because it was so safe it was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">wonderful and then when i</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">grew a little older when i became a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">teenager i love the kibbutz even more</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">of sharing everything equally seemed</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">justice the the right thing the fair</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">to do but then as i grew a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">and especially after i started to study</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">economics at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">hebrew university i became a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">like the other side of the cliche</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">you know that if you are younger than 20</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">and you are not a socialist it means you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">have no heart but if you are over 20 and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">you are still a socialist</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">it means you have no brain and so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">one day in the late 90s when i we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">visiting my</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">uncle and aunt in the kibbutz in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">north</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">and we would sit down and my uncle would</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">describe one of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">path-breaking innovations of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">irrigation factory of his kibbutz and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">decided to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">provoke him and i said you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">according to economic theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">your factory shouldn&#39;t be as good in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">fact the entire enterprise of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">kibbutz should not really exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">and he&#39;s like what what are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">about and i said well</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">you know why would anybody work hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">if all you get anyway is an equal share</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">of the total output so i explained to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">him the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">free rider problem that we studied in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">economics and then i</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">said i expect that everybody would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">lazy in the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">and then why would anybody that can earn</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">more outside the kibbutz and is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">talented and brilliant why would</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">brain drain problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">whereby i expect all the brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">people to move away from the keyboards</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">i said well what about entry i expect</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:49.759" style="s2">that</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">subsidized by all the brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">more educated people in the kibbutz and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">continued with my super annoying speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">of mine and i said well i also worry a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">bit about the children in the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">why would anybody study hard when</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">we&#39;re like a high school dropout and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">computer science engineer earned just as</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">and so he you know then he got upset of</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">and he we started a nice fight and he</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">said oh you economists are so cynical</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">and you know anybody familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">kibbutz knows that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">founders of kibbutzim were anything but</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">and if you&#39;re so smart then you know how</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">could you explain that the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">survived</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">for so long despite all these problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">you are describing and it got me</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">thinking and to begin with i wasn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">cynical as i made myself sound and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">that&#39;s it ever since then i studied</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">decided to study</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">how conch would seem survive for so long</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">despite all their economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">contradictions and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">more broadly how when whether we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">create a more equal</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">society and under what conditions it can</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">succeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:05.919" style="s2">exactly yeah when i read that i go yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">i definitely want to track this guy down</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.919" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">and have him on the show</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s a wonderful contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">right because you know based on the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">kinds of economics i learned when i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">in college</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">you&#39;d say nope kabut&#39;s impossible and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">yet here they are a hundred years later</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">so there has to be something else that</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">was missing from the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">that would be real helpful for our</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">guests who who no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">know vaguely what a kibbutz is is if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">could do as you do in the book in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">first chapter or so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">and go into a little bit of the history</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">you know just a relative short arc</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:38.680" style="s2">of the history of the kibbutz movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">and you know basically take it up to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.680" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">1977</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not go to the crisis but</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">up to about then</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.919" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">sure let me do it briefly let me know if</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">you want more details so so kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">plural of kibbutz are communities in</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">sharing it was a way of life if you want</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">they took equality so seriously that</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">had a huge impact on the rest of israeli</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">hebrew team participated in this process</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">you know more professional more abstract</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">types of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">occupations exactly so they said exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">so they were at first</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">exactly like you say they they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">meant to uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">they they thought that the only way for</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">the jewish people to survive is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">return to the land</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">and work in the kind of productive</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">quote-unquote occupations like</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">in agriculture and so on rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">study the torah and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">working in more professional occupations</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">but then again they</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">started to all build factories in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">60s and 70s and as you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">despite the small percentage of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">population they are higher percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">industrial production in israel so they</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">had high economic social</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">military status kibbutz members and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">had a disproportionate impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">ideological political and military</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">leadership of israel they produce some</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">of israel&#39;s elite like from famous</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">generals like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">igal alon and barak to famous musicians</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">like shalom khan</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">the academia is full of former kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">members</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll return to that later in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">you know the kibbutz is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">interesting and and somewhat unlike a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">lot of other communal</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">attempts elsewhere in the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">at least after the early days the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">kibbutz nicks were not marginal i mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">these were</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:10.839" style="s2">in some sense the elite of israeli as</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">you point out they</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.839" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">disproportionately into military</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">leadership and the arts</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">and all kinds of interesting things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">that&#39;s worth the audience keeping in</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">mind these were not a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:22.959" style="s2">rejectionist hippies right these were</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">people playing the game seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.959" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">just in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">exactly this is you know this is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">got me so interested in them because</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">unlike a lot of other communists in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">history as you said they were never in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">the margin of society they always</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:38.160" style="s2">influenced and were influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">society around them they will</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">they would go to schools uh high schools</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">non-ki boots members they would serve in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">the military with non kibbutz members</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">uh and so at some level it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">the amish or like or like other communes</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">maybe they have such different belief</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">system than society around them</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">that it just makes sense for them to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">group by themselves in in a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">isolated place</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">kibbutz members at some level they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">so interesting to me for me to study</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">despite being so central they choose to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">in that way even though many of them can</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">live elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">and even though they do see society</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">around them and how other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">live yeah that and that makes them to my</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">mind more</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">interesting actually as a model exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">you know it shows that it may well be</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">possible to build egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">bubbles inside even a capitalist society</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">and make them sustainable the boots did</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">quite successfully for quite a while and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">some of them are still working doing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">successfully to this day</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">another little bit about the history</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">which i found utterly fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">which is that the puts was not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">monolithic movement there were different</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">flavors of kibbutz you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">kibbutz artsy which was more</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">ideologically pure and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">kibbutz muhad is that it how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">pronounce it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">became the united kibbutz movement which</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">was more pragmatic i suppose in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">and then there was a cavazot association</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">that argued for no more than 200 members</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">per kibbutz while the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">muhad said make them as big as possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">right so they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">from my jewish friends they say hey you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">know if you get two jews together</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">there&#39;ll be three opinions</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">at least right seems to have been true</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">essentially the style of kibbutz and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">some of these things merged and they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">split again and then there was always a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">small orthodox jewish religious oriented</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">kibbutz movement that really didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">much to do with the other kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">so maybe talk just a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">those organizations and styles of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">yeah absolutely i would first say though</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">to your previous point that another</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">thing that is interesting about their</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">model is that beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say the other communes in history</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">it&#39;s also they didn&#39;t choose the model</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">soviet union for example or other</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">socialist countries</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">that are totalitarian and would you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">in a russian cohort for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">exit they</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">they would kill you well that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">very interesting economic decisions then</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">of whether to stay or live rather than</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.440" style="s2">the more voluntary model that they took</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">as for the movements the movements are</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.440" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">all have a fascinating history that i</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">discussed in some detail in my book</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">interestingly they were never very</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">important in the day-to-day life of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have any say on how each</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">individual keyboard exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">handled their business as well they did</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">some but not a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">mostly they coordinated their actions</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">and would seem affiliated themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">with movements of different ideological</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">bands so as you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">some of them are more ideological than</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">others that&#39;s the kibbutz rt</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">others are more that&#39;s the kibbutz mohad</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">as you said</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">and and for many years in the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">out even outside israel never people</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">never understood really</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">what it means you know like whether you</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">belong to that movement or this movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">but then it it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">especially in the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">around the cold war when there was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">really fierce debate</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">among kibbutz members of whether they</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.079" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">should support</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">the us or the soviet union you know like</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">cold war and kibbutzim actually split</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">over these</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">ideological decisions you know like and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">some and then they became ahad versus</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">you know really in fact there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">stories of families even splitting into</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">two over this debate and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">this was kind of like people outside of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">the kibbutz israelis were scratching</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">their heads saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">what are they talking about why is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">so important for the way they live but</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">then uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">later in the book i do find that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">would seem that we&#39;re associated with</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">the more ideological movements</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">were less likely to undertake reforms</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">and they were slower to adapt the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">that we might that we are going to shift</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">away from equal sharing that we may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">talking about a bit later in the talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">okay and again it makes fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">reading and the ebb and flow and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">relationship but the politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s fascinating we won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">it today but i would say people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">interested in that&#39;s included in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">book and then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">henry near book goes into it in</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">exhausting detail</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">which i found interesting but as you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">said in your speech to your uncle there</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">seemingly some contradictions from an</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">economic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">about the kibbutz free rider problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">adverse selection brain drain</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">and we&#39;ll get to those later but before</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">we do you had a nice section in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">book where you kind of stood on its head</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">and said why might an economist create a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">yeah so what are the economic advantages</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">at least in theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">and as it turned out i think in practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">at least in part of something like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">so imagine the founders of kibbutzim who</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">decide to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">get the advice of an economist about</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">whether and how they should</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">create their keyboards well you know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:47.600" style="s2">the economist was a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">narrow-minded cynical as i presented</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">myself to my uncle he would say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">terrible idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">it would collapse very quickly don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">but if this economist had the foresight</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">of how economics would develop</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">over the next century or so and if he</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">was humble enough to borrow</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">insights from some of the other social</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">sciences from history</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">then it&#39;s very likely that he would tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">them to create the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">pretty much the way they ended up</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">creating it well</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">not exactly he would for sure have give</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">more voice to women</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">avoid some of the corruption that took</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">place in the higher ups of kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">but pretty much the way they they</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">created it and so maybe he would say at</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">he would say well you know like now that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">i get over my</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">uh instincts that equality might create</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">incentive problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">beyond all the other reasons that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">mentioned to me like the socialist</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">ideology altruism fairness</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">considerations maybe philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">ideals</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">like the rosian ideals of equality i can</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">actually see</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">an economic advantage of creating</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">kibbutz in a purely economic advantage</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">and that is that a kibbutz gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">terrific</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">insurance a safety net against all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">problems and miseries that life can</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">bring you so in a kibbutz you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">regardless of what happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">whether you become disabled whether you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">your profession is becoming out of style</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">whether you get injured whether you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">that face some problems regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">your circumstances you and your family</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">would always be</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">getting paid the same and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">terrific insurance that no other place</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">can offer you and so though he would of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">course say</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">you should still worry about all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">incentive programs because the insurance</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">arrangement can</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">collapse if you don&#39;t worry about it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">then he would say well i have some</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">advice for you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">you would say first of all i really</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">strongly suggest for you to bring highly</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">idealistic people</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">to your effort so don&#39;t just bring these</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">cynical people that are so selfish that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">they only care about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">but rather try to bring people that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">share the same ideological and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">vocational training</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">that are idealistic that they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">shared in common goals</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">you know my those kind of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">idealistic people they don&#39;t share you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">know my grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">did not miss a day of work in 55 years</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">she lived in a kibbutz idealistic people</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">they contribute anyway even when there</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">are no incentives</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">and then he will tell them to they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">build the kibbutz in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">avoid all this incentive you know he</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">would tell them don&#39;t trust though</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">on the idealistic nature of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">because the second generation like often</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">for the children of the founders living</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">in the kibbutz is no longer a choice</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a default you know you grew up into</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">this and when this happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">practical considerations often become</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">more important than idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">considerations</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">and so you should build your society in</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">such a way that will help you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">all these incentive problems we in a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">that pretty much like didn&#39;t i can go in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">details to that but i will let you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">do you want me to continue to talk or do</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">you want to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">yeah once you continue to drill into it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">a little bit i&#39;ll just point out too</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">one is that in you can go into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">examples there&#39;s opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.679" style="s2">increasing return to scale</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">in some activities right classic</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.679" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">microeconomics</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">great so imagine the so the economist</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">would say okay how should you build the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">well what about let&#39;s think about free</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">the free riding problem you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">tendency of people to not pull in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">with the weight when there is full equal</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">sharing well how about social sanctions</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">you know in kibbutz everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">everybody you work in the same place you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">your kids go to the same schools</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">kibutsim are all</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.039" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">you know the size between about 100</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:52.360" style="s2">people to a thousand people the average</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">size of a kibbutz is around</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.360" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">440 members which is about 150 or 200</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">families</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">so they can make in the kibbutz they can</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">make your life sufficiently miserable</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">that you are better off living rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">than not working hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t work hard they wouldn&#39;t sit</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">next to you in the dining hall they</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.559" style="s2">would let you feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">awful but of course the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.559" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">for social sanctions to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">you kind of need to design a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">small community</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">because social sanctions don&#39;t uh you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">know work in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">huge country of like when not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">knows everybody and this is despite as</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">there are many reasons for why creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">large kibbutz has benefits over creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">many small ones there are what</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">economists call</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">returns to scale you know some services</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">laundry and food are cheaper to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">produce in large quantities relative</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">than in small quantities</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">and in fact there was a debate in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">kibbutz at some point about whether they</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">as you mentioned earlier whether they</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">should allow only 200 people</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">or whether they should make it larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">and it always gets to well let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">them we still have to keep them small</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">in order for everybody to know everybody</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">and you know for social sanctions to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">effective that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">that&#39;s essential you don&#39;t find jaw you</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">don&#39;t find a job</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">no problem you know the kibbutz work</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">organizer will send you to peel potatoes</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">in the chicken so there is no such thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">as unemployment in the kibbutz everybody</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">is working</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">and of course the other side of social</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">sanctions is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">a social reward if you want so like</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">rotations in leadership so unlike many</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">other communes</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">it was never in the key but it was never</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">one charismatic leader that is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">leader of the kibbutz for 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">leadership is rotated so the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">manager the farm manager</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">the kibbutz secretary those are jobs</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">that are rotated and that they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">always given to people who are perceived</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">more than their share now adverse</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">selection you worry about people that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">that are lazy or didn&#39;t make it outside</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">you want them you worry that they might</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">enter the keyboards</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">believe me the kibbutzim are well aware</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">of this problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">and in fact if you want to enter they</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">have tough screening processes</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">for people who want to join you have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">show that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">make a living in the kibbutz that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:17.760" style="s2">have a high enough education</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">there is even once you get in even once</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.760" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">they let you in you are on a probation</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">period for a year or two</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">until they vote they get to know you and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">they vote</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">whether to allow you to stay of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">founding generation this was an easier</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">problem because</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">the founders were all young people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">similar ideology and training and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">had like if you want similar prospects</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the homogeneity of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">that were very similar that naturally</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">solve</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">the other selection problem but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">less likely that a</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">create a keyboard with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">high school dropout and this is why they</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">go through the screening now the tougher</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">is the is the brain drain what about</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">brain how do you make sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">that people who are in the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">members of the kibbutz maybe they they</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">joined when they were young but at some</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">point people realize if they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">very bright and all they they have an</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">ability to earn much more in tel aviv</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:15.120" style="s2">how do you make sure they stay</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">well the economist would tell them why</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">don&#39;t you abolish all private property</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">have all property owned collectively and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">want to leave no problem you can take</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">your brain with you but you cannot take</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">your share of the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">you cannot take your part of the factory</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">you cannot take your house</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">you cannot take the swimming pool and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">the dining hall and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">that makes exit costly there is no money</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">for many years and so there is no</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">ability to save and so there is no</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">bequest</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">so makes it makes it difficult to live</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">even if you are very ambitious you want</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">to study no problem the kibbutz would</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">allow you to study agronomy</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">but not law so they would let you study</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">stuff that is more valuable in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">kibbutz and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">make it uh make exit costing now i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:02.480" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">just wanna say that of course i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.480" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">saying that all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">norms and rules in the kibbutz were</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">decided just in order to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">solve the incentive problems there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">many ideological and other reasons for</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">and communal education for children and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">dining hall</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">the point is that whether they meant it</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">or not whether they designed it on</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">purpose or not</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">these and as you said these</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">innovations were probably emerged for a</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">but interestingly they they tended to</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">was helpful to deal with incentive</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">problems makes perfect sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">though of course there are trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">around quality of life for instance</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">you point out and others do as well that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">one of the most important ways to</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">social sanctions is privacy</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">has to be pretty limited and in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">early days</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">you know that one of the the core</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.360" style="s2">phenomena at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">kibbutz was the dining hall right life</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.360" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">in many ways seemed to be central around</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">the dining hall that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">arts events happened etc but then over</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">you know so some kibbutz has allowed</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">families to have their own kitchens etc</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">and so presumably sort of radical</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">transparency started going down a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">bit and i suspect free rider problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">could have gone up</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">any thoughts on that yeah exactly so so</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">you ask yourself if it&#39;s so amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">they provide you such a terrific</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">insurance</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">and the equality is is a value that many</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">of us like and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">we want to live that way how come</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">kibutim always exists in israel although</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">if you are me you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">elements of kibbutzim everywhere we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">talk about it later but but</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">how come they are such a small</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">percentage even of the population of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">israel you know two percentage of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">at most they were seven and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">is that uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">in order for you to in order for this to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">work you need social sanctions for</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">uh you need it means lack of privacy</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">everybody in the kibbutz knows you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">coming and going</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">you need to have communal ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">property that is something that many</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">people don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">until this day you ask my mom hey mom</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">where are you going she says</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">you know what i stopped answering that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">question 45 years ago when i left the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">kibbutz don&#39;t ask me</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">what i&#39;m up to where i&#39;m going i want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">i want to live my life without people</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">knowing my coming and going</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">and so if you want that lack of privacy</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">the lack of private property which was</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">so essential in the traditional kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">help solve some of the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">problems are stuff that many people</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">don&#39;t like and maybe that explains why</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">it is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">if you want the kibbutz is almost like</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">an experiment to know how many people</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">would like to live that way so you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">ask yourself the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">if people were given a choice of whether</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">to live in a society</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">where all incomes and resources are</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">shared equally</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">how many people would choose to do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">and if you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">the kibbutz gives you some answer you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">know like up to seven percent</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">of the population interesting and though</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">of course you also have to adjust that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">by how many are rejected by the adverse</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">selection screening</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">it might be higher but if you make the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">intersection of those who would like to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">and are capable of exactly that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:57.279" style="s2">so it could be it could be larger if</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">it would be that the perfect experiment</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.279" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">would be to allow free entry to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">uh or and to see like how many people uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">would join and i think a few kabuts</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">tried that in the early days and found</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">it was a disaster right</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">not so much in the early days as much as</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">in the in the 19 in the early 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">there are stories of some kibutim</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">trying to open their doors to uh you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">know to open the doors and were not very</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">happy with their decision at some level</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">though if you want that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">that&#39;s another price if you want of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">creating an equal sharing society is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">that the kibbutzim were never very</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">so with if you want the price of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">inside the kibbutz means also inequality</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">across groups because you you know if</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">you you have to show that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">earn a living in the kibbutz they</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t let you in if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">enough education</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">if you you know they didn&#39;t accept arabs</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">you know if the kibbutz is a jewish</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">even you know it&#39;s mostly ashkenazi</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">jewish phenomena even though today they</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:30:58.640" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">accept you even if you&#39;re not of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.640" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">but if you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">the screening the kibbutz point to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">price of equal sharing which is that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">is not very inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">in its equality yeah and i did extract</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">that actually while i was</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">reading is that again it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">billiard player they probably maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">had thought about this explicitly but</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">a certain amount of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">similarity of people and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.880" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">people so that you can understand them</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">this kind of system and i suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">that may have been part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">driving force why it&#39;s almost purely</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">ashkenazi at least for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">relatively few sephardim the homogeneity</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">at some level if you think about it more</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">broadly it is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">homogeneity makes it easier to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">and it is not surprising that there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">more equality</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">in countries like sweden and norway</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">where the population is more homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">than in the united states where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">population is more</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">heterogeneous and it is more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">to uh define</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">common goals if you want yeah yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s an important point you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">unfortunately i think it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">reality that diversity is a value but</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">monotonically increasing value right i</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">give the example suppose you lived in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">community of 150 families and every</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">single one of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">was from a different culture and spoke a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">different language and none of them knew</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">two languages</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">that would not be a very pleasant place</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">to live right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">there&#39;s an optimal amount of diversity</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">like there&#39;s an optimal amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">everything and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">i suspect that in a mission like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">kibbutz the amount</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">of diversity that is tolerable to keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">the high enough level of coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">probably smaller than an open market</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">driven society yeah the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">does make it more difficult for them to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">create this is also but although this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">one reason why for example if you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">about national insurance programs they</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">typically are mandatory so social</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">insurance is mandatory exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">because you worry that only the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">healthiest wealthiest people would</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">join it and so for sure it is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">diversity makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">difficult to sustain equality but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">also brings the broader question about</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">how much</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">really we should consider it equality</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">if it is only equality among such a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">and homogeneous group of people so how</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">fair it is to call it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">that you live with that you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">want to do equality because you believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">in fairness</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">and you believe that everybody is equal</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">and you believe that everybody should</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">have equal opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:37.840" style="s2">then how serious we should take you if</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">you&#39;re only doing it among a small group</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">of homogeneous people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s certainly a real issue for</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">people that are trying to say think</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">launching such communities today now</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">there&#39;s another economic</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">conundrum that you pointed out a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">bit more subtle perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">than the other ones which are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">and that is the problem of human capital</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">here&#39;s the words you use why should</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">kovitz members study hard if a high</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">school dropout working in the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">kitchen and a computer scientist</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">running the most profitable business in</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">the combusts enjoyed the same living</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">standards</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:13.599" style="s2">maybe talk about that a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">how the economics economic forces at</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.599" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">would have a tendency to impact human</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">capital investment</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">yes so this is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">question and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">as you say it&#39;s a bit more subtle my</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">first intuition</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">for my skepticism came again from this</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">conversation with my uncle where i said</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">why would you study hard in school why</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">would you stress over exams why would</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">you choose fields of study</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">that are difficult if you have no</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">returns to your education if you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">there are zero returns to education in</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">egalitarian kibbutz the financial</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">returns to education are zero</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">because if your high school dropout or</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">if you are a computer science engineer</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">you get paid exactly the same now</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:56.079" style="s2">that&#39;s from the individual perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">from the kibbutz perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.079" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">they in addition to that they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">conflicting incentives because on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">other on the one hand if you want as</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">extended family they would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">their children study whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">they want but on the other hand as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">employer</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">they might work they also want their</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">employers to be educated that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">reason to want high level of human</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">but on the other hand they might worry</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">that if you are really very educated</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">you might want to leave and if all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">bright all the very educated people</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">this is a problem for the kibbutz so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">one of the things and so this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">if you want the theory now</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">i looked at the numbers i looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">data and you know a lot of what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">doing relies on the large data sets that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">i collected</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">for the 100 years of kibbutz existence</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">and one of the things i do in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">human capital is i ask the simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">question well</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">well then are kibbutz members less</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">educated than the general population</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">so in order to make a fair comparison i</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">say okay kibusi means a jewish phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.320" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">they mostly have ashkenazi jews well</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">archibus members</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">much less educated than the ashkenazi</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">jewish population</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">outside of kibutim if there are such</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">lack of incentives to study</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">and the answer is not really so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">average the average kibbutz member even</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">in the periods of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">of equal sharing on average they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">similarly educated to the ashkenazi</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">population outside</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">of course they you know in the margin</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">there are differences so for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">less of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">are completely uneducated relative to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">the general population but also fewer of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">them have maybe very advanced</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">degrees but this is one thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">take as if you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">suggestive against this a simple</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">economic theory of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">studying because of the financial</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">but many people know that you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">study for the financial returns there</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">are other reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">why you want to study now economic</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">theory is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">completely wrong here so for example we</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">do find in a work that i&#39;m doing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">my collaborator victor lavie from the</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">segev we look at what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">once the keyboard seems shift away from</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">equal sharing maybe we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">that and we do find that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">kibbutz students do start to take school</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">more seriously once their keyboards</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">shift away from equal sharing and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">do start to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:24.240" style="s2">fields that are more potentially</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">profitable so</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.240" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">they do respond to incentives it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">like the incentive problems stop at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">gate of the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">but but but maybe the maybe economic</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:35.839" style="s2">incentives to study are not the main</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">reason of why people study hard and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.839" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">fields they choose</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">and as always it&#39;s a mix i mean the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">to declare humans to be homo economic is</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">almost always fails right</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">by the other hand homo economicus is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">part of who we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">i would hypothesize i wonder if you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">the answer to this is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">full equal earnings period was there a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">bias away from the liberal arts say</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">history and literature versus</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">say engineering or nursing yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we tend to find there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">a bias</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">there is actually once the key boots</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">shift away from equal sharing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">later with a period we didn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">yet but once the keyboards shift away</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">from equal sharing later</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">you start to see that young adults in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">the kibbutz become more likely</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">to study fields like engineering and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">sciences in general as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">a liberal arts in the equal sharing</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">period they were more likely to study</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">history and arts and and humanities</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">that have a global economic financial</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">returns outside of the keyboards</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">very interesting yeah we&#39;ll get to soon</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">the crisis and then transition</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">but before that i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">just a couple of interesting issues that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">came out that don&#39;t really fit into</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">either the pre or post bucket</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">i guess they&#39;ve actually occurred in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">pre period one</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">is the ideology versus the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">gender equality</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">yeah so the kibbutz it&#39;s exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">you say there is a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">big gap between the ideology and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">of gender equality in the kingdoms as</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">people who consider themselves taking</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">very seriously many kibbutzim also</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">was striving for gender equality and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">that meant that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">women were fighting in the wars they</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">they were they were supposed to working</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">in all those occupations</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">that men work in and most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">one of the arguments for creating a real</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">gender equality is to free up</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">women from their traditional role in</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">society of raising kids</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">and that gave rise one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">that gave rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">separate residences for children where</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">children all grow up in outside of their</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">parents homes</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">and the parents get to see them a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">of hours but then every</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">couple in the kibbutz have a gets a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">apartment just for the couple and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">should free women from the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:04.160" style="s2">world in society now one thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">already know from the history is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.160" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">all kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.040" style="s2">thought that that was a very bad idea at</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">some point and alki would see him in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">late 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">early 80s they cancel basically the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">they bring kids to back home but more</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">than this</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">in the reality of the of the life in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">kibbutzim even in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">period where children lived communally</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">was that women</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">ended up working more in the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">stereotypical</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">female occupation like they were the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">nanny in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">children residents was always a woman</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">and women</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">ended up working more in the services</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">and less in the productive</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">branches and also many people say that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">actually the voice of women in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">general assembly was less</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">important so it was mostly the men that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">were doing the talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">and women were not taken very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">into economy this is one reason that i</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">when i told you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">that the economist would tell the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">kibbutzim to create the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">just very similar to the way they did</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">but not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons is because if</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">for sure it would give more voice to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">women and so it was it</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">created this contradiction between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">equality that they strive for and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">reality of women working in</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">and doing their traditional works yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">frankly that doesn&#39;t surprise me i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">to be honest we were emerging from 10</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">000 years of patriarchy at that time to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">expect the switch to be thrown</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">would have probably been unrealistic you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">know obviously the world&#39;s come a long</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">way since then</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">but we&#39;re still not all the way there so</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">like anything it&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">maturation</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">and understanding and change you touched</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">on this which is the bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">children back to the family</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">and one of the things i don&#39;t freaking i</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">don&#39;t remember was your book or henry</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">near&#39;s book but i do recall that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:51.560" style="s2">some of the earliest kibbutz&#39;s were</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">kind of radically and ideologically</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.560" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">anti-bourgeois</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">family and some of them even advocated</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">free love</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">and not even having couples in housing</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">and certainly all the children being</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">raised together from very young ages was</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">part of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">but over time quite the opposite</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">if anything kabut&#39;s people may be more</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">bourgeois in their family structures</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.480" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">than average in israel</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">and as you point out the return of at</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">least the younger children there was i</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">older children still live communally and</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">like 12 or over</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">something like that in in many kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">so part of the early ideology at least</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:29.920" style="s2">for some was radical anti-bourgeois</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:31.200" style="s2">family but that didn&#39;t really work out</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.920" end="00:42:33.599" style="s2">so well</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">right so the the i think that even a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.599" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">deeper reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">children&#39;s residence was the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">they wanted to educate their children</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">to the you know to the kibbutz ideals</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">into the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">communal way of living and they thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">that one way of doing it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">to have them all equal and give them</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">equal opportunities and to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">talk to them about equality for you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">from a very early age and the literature</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:00.400" style="s2">on the communal residences of children</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">is large and somewhat complicated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">not a very simple story of it was great</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">or it was terrible it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">like a summer camp in the us you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">how some children love it</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">and they think it was terrific and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">got to hang out with all their friends</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">worry about their parents all the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">and other the more sensitive children</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">find it uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">terrible and they want to go go home and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s a little bit a mixed</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">experience it was a mixed experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">like that at some point it was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">the parents that just wanted their</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">they just kind of felt that it was just</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">not natural for them</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">to have their children not grow in their</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">houses</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">that led to a push to to to abolish them</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">i would say i would touch another thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">that you said that is a bit more broader</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">than the children residences the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">bourgeois idea that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">so at some level the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">puzzling period of kibbutzim the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">interesting one if you want is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:02.400" style="s2">those middle years</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">in the 60s and 70s when they were no</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.400" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">longer based on agriculture only</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">they had industry there was more</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">heterogeneity people worked in all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">of different occupations</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">they had factories at some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">not very surprising maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">a small group of people who come</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">in a young age to a country full of</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">you know from socialist backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">create them for themselves a</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">community that is based on equality it</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">is most surprising that</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">by the second generation and third</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">generation people who grow up</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">into it didn&#39;t decide intentionally to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">join</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">and now many people working in many</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">different occupations</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">that are rather heterogeneous relative</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">to their parents</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">they still choose to live in an equal</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">sharing society and create one that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">rather successful but that was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:57.040" style="s2">when in the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">israelis some of the contradictions of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.040" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">the kibbutz started to emerge ah so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">talking about equality and simple life</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">but all i can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">is that you have a nice swimming pools</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">uh and beautiful uh paths and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">more bourgeois</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">than even the rest of us there was also</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">there were some contradictions you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">around the time when people started to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">come to israel from more middle eastern</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">faraday jews the prime minister at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">ben gurion asked kibbutzim if they can</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">host some of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:30.480" style="s2">people as a first house in the you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">let them work and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.480" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">adjust to the new country and what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:35.920" style="s2">hear a little bit when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">this ferrari jews talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">experience you hear many people say</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">we were very welcome in their fields but</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">not very much in their dining halls</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">again creating a sense that in the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">of some people they were more like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">club elitist club</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">then they were an inclusive society</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">for everybody to be fair for them it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.200" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">tricky business and the socialist and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">zionist ideology</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">often clashed with one another so if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">know on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">as zionists they wanted to when jewish</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">people come they want to host them but</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.079" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">as socialists they cannot be they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">not allowed to exploit outside</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">labor and so i think that he would seem</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">have a number of contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">built in them at some level some of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">a lot of their beauty</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.280" style="s2">is that they are flexible enough to</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">adjust the rules to the practicality of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.280" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">in order to survive rather than like</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">many other communes in history just to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">collapse as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">there are some practical difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">yeah and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a very good takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">that even the ones that were very</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">ideological</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">were not insane about it i suppose the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">ones that were insane probably just went</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">away but you know they</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">they were pragmatic they were empirical</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">they responded to reality</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to our next section here a</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">lot of what we&#39;ve been talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">pre-crisis period and you know as you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">said the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">the high water mark probably of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">kibbutz movement was in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">60s and 70s and then came the 1977</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">election of the likud party historically</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:12.720" style="s2">all the coalitions that had governed</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">israel had had as a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.720" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">component the labor party or its</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">antecedents and those parties had always</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">been pretty strongly aligned with one or</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">more of the kibbutz movements and had</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">in various ways helped subsidize the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">kavitz movement provided favoritism for</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">boots nicks to enter the government and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">the military etc</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">but with the election of the lacude that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">started to change and then the debt</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">crisis of the 80s maybe talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">yeah so the kibbutzim were successful</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">in the 60s and 70s and they had high</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">in part because they were able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">successfully</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">solve the incentive problems and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">were able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">create successful factories and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">they got it right at some level</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">but we can&#39;t forget that entirety&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">economic success was because of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">governmental support</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">so uh the kibbutzim have always enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">the support of the government and before</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">the state of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">israel was established the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">agencies</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">in the form of land in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">subsidies for water</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">in the form of tax advantages</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:22.640" style="s2">and so on there was somehow an explicit</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">and implicit</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.640" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">understanding between them and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">jewish</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">agencies that if things go wrong they</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">access to credit from the government now</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">over time especially starting the 80s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">number of uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">factors started to make it would seem</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">less attractive one of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">is the one you talk about declining</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">governmental support</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">with the rise of the right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">government for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">israel&#39;s history in 1977</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">that government no longer viewed</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">kibbutzi</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">as so special they viewed them more as</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">the creation of the labour party</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">that came before them and there was that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">definitely was one</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">reason that made he would seem less</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:10.880" style="s2">attractive other things were</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">a decline in idealism in the second and</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.880" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">third generation so again</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">the idea that when living in a kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">is not your</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">choice but you default you are born into</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">it the second and third generation were</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">no longer as idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">as the founders of kibbutzim there was</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:28.079" style="s2">the declining governmental support and</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">then but there was also the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.079" end="00:49:31.119" style="s2">a high-tech boom in israel you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">israel</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.119" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">in the 90s have this high-tech boom</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">that make it more attractive for kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">members</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">especially one that can earn more</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">outside that gives them an increased</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">to live if you want israel itself was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">relatively</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">egalitarian country before the in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">before the 80s and it becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:55.920" style="s2">and so all these reasons made hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">seem less attractive and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.920" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">there was the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">the financial crisis was it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">too complicated to talk about it for too</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">long here i talked about it a lot in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">but there were a number of reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">the financial crisis one of them israel</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">in the time was in a period of high</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">inflation</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">israel in the 80s was in a period of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">very high inflation 400 percent yearly</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">inflation</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">and the kibbutz uh as you know always</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">had a as i told you always had this</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">credit in the government they took large</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">loans they took loans to in part to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">bring the children from the children</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">residences back home they needed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">expand the housing stock</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">so they took loans they took loans to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">expand their industries</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.359" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">and loans were not linked to inflation</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:41.119" style="s2">so it was very it&#39;s very easy to repay a</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">loan when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.119" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">not linked to inflation and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.559" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">inflation is 400</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">but then at some point the government</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">decided to take action</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">and they had a stabilization program and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">as part of it they</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">left interest rates very high and made</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:50:59.599" style="s2">the loans that the kibbutzim were taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.599" end="00:51:03.040" style="s2">and uh very difficult for kibbutzim to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">repay</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">and then kibbutzim at some level were</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">too big to fail</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">and so they had like a number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">agreements with the government and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">banks and the kibbu team</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">that basically uh restructured the loans</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">postponed some of their loan payments</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">and erased some other parts of the loans</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">and essentially though required he would</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">seem to reduce their living standards</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:29.520" style="s2">by by quite by quite a bit so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s about the crisis i can&#39;t i can i</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.520" end="00:51:33.040" style="s2">can stop here i can talk more about that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">the reforms that came later</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.040" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a good place to stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">for a second and then what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">and probably predictable i&#39;d love to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">your thought on that which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">you know beginning with these crises</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">there was much more of a movement away</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">pure radical egalitarianism but at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">by my read it was on a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">some stayed all pure egalitarian or damn</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">close to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">others ended up almost pure capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">and then a bunch were in between</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">and strikes me what a wonderful found</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">experiment for an economist right</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">here you go from radical egalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">spectrum of moves away from it or</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">staying with it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">as you have done you collected a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">data and we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">you know find out what the different</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">alternatives to radical egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">led to with respect to some of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">predictions so you know maybe talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">that just a little bit maybe how you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:26.559" style="s2">gathered the data and then talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">some of the findings</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.559" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">yes so jim so this is exactly what i</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.400" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">thought when i was doing my phd at</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">northwestern and so that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:35.119" style="s2">decided</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">to write my dissertation about</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.119" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">i noticed that kibbutzim they had very</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">different experience with the financial</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">crisis some were hit a lot some were hit</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">and then later they had very different</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">experience with the with the shift</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">away from equal sharing</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:52.079" style="s2">and so after they just to give some</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">context after the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.079" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">a few years after the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">starting the mid 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">kibbutzim started a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">called privatization i put</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">privatization in quotation mark because</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">privatization in kibbutzi means</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean completely privatize</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">everything it really means just a series</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">of reforms</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">starting first with just reforms that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">were meant to avoid waste</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">and increase productivity things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">you have to pay for your food and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">electricity so that you don&#39;t leave your</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">air condition on</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">all day and don&#39;t fill up your plate</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">too much food and things like taking</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">some of the kibbutz branches</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">and bring some outside managers that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">actually know how to manage rather than</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">kibbutz members</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">that maybe don&#39;t have that much</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">experience with management so this was</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">like the first</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">early waves of the of reforms but then</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">later they started with really deeper</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">reforms</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">of differential wages so shifting from</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">the very idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">of the full equal sharing shifting away</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">from equal sharing to various degrees as</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">you said</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:57.280" style="s2">some kibbutzim shifted to a large degree</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">away from equal sharing</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.280" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">others to just a small degree and others</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">about 20 percent of kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">remain completely egalitarian and so i</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">decided to start by</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">writing about that you know at some po</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.400" style="s2">at some level if i if i go back in</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">in my the way my thinking evolved on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">kibbutz at some level the idea of how we</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">create an equal society</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">and all those questions i was at first</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">were a little bit too big for me to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">started with and so i started with</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:25.760" style="s2">smaller question</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">collecting data you know reading the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.760" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">sociology the history the economics of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">kibbutzim talking to kibbutz members of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">all ages</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">to reading a lot of the history but also</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">collecting</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">data on all the 120 000 members in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">260 he would see him over the last many</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">many years</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">and one of the first questions i started</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">with is asking the questions of which he</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">would seem</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">decide eventually to stay equal in which</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">he puts him decide to shift</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">away from equal sharing and the main</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">thing that i find</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">is that once the financial crisis hit</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">and this was as you said</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.599" style="s2">at some level it&#39;s a great experiment to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:05.359" style="s2">to understand what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.599" end="00:55:07.599" style="s2">limits of equality</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.359" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">and one of the things that i find in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.599" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">is that after the financial crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:13.839" style="s2">once kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:15.359" style="s2">were required to reduce the living</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.839" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">standards quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.359" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">a massive process of brain drain started</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">so i take the data i take two censuses</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">of population</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">before and after the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">and i find that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.880" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">and i link them and i find that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">that were more educated and skilled</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:34.400" style="s2">were much more likely to leave kibutim</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">and about 20 25 percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">of skilled people leave kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">and then what i find more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">than that i find that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">kibbutzim that remained rich after the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">financial crisis so some kibbutzim were</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">not hit</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">very much by the financial crisis they</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">remained richer they did not were not</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">required to reduce the living standards</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">they are the ones that tend to remain</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">equal so keep</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">rich hibu team maintain the high degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">of equality</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">he would seem that were hit by the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">financial crisis and we required to</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">reduce the living standards</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">are the first to shift away from equal</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">and once they do fewer and fewer of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">talent of the educated members</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">exit and so that was like my main</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">finding that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">richard kibbutziem maintain a higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">degree of equality and again</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">in my mind this raised the question of</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">to what extent the some of the social</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:29.359" style="s2">democratic countries like against norway</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">and sweden</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.359" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">that of course are different than</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">kibbutzim they are based on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">free market but they have more higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">degree of equality</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">to what extent they are able to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">such a generous welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">because they are so rich you know like</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">what have what would happen if they</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">if there was an oil crisis in norway and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">norway would become less rich</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:51.520" style="s2">would there be more break if the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">is any guidance</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.520" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">uh perhaps there would be more brain</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">drain and they would have to most to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">struggle more with the welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting insight and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">probably a very important insight for</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">anyone who wants to build</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:06.559" style="s2">a community which probably is the degree</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">you want to be able to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.559" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">equal sharing egalitarianism you better</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">figure out how to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">really successful in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s hard to maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">in poverty right a question i have for</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">you i i don&#39;t recall if you looked into</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">this or not</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">i think you did which is did ideology</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">did have a measurable impact for</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">instance in the kibbutz artsy folks</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.079" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">move less far from equal sharing or not</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">yes ideology did overall so</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">he boots members from the rt movement</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">the one that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">is more ideological we&#39;re slower to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">shift away from equal sharing they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">less likely</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">to shift away from equal sharing kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">members</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">in kibbutzim where the voting was more</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">to the left if you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:52.839" style="s2">in national governments were less likely</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">to shift so there is some evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.839" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">ideology play a role in fact you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">like the twenty percent of kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">that maintain equal sharing are now</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">they call themselves the communal stream</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">and they are</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">rewriting if you want the id not</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">rewriting but actually they say that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">other kibbutzim are rewriting</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">the original ideology and that and they</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">restate their commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">ideas of of equality so ideology did</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">play a role but i have to say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">i concluded that if ideology maybe had</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">a bigger role in the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">kibbutzim to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">in their long success but economic</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">factors were more important</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:33.760" style="s2">in explaining the shift away from equal</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">sharing than ideological factors</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.760" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">okay that&#39;s interesting a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">that you talked about for sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">were you analyzed in the book we hit it</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">about earlier which is the increase in</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:46.000" style="s2">financial return to education</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:48.000" style="s2">changed a fair amount about how</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.000" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">education particularly higher education</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.000" end="00:58:51.680" style="s2">was consumed but also how seriously</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">people took education</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.680" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">at the secondary level yeah so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a maybe that&#39;s one place where i</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">can explain a little bit in more detail</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">some of the data work that we do if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">for your readers let&#39;s do it so again</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">this is work always with victor lavier</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">who is one of the world experts in</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">economics of education</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">and basically what we do is we collected</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">data imagine you want to know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">happens when key boots shift away from</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">equal sharing</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">so you know that economic theory says</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:20.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">people let&#39;s say invest one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.799" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">reasons why people invest in</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">in education and why they study hard and</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">why they choose certain fields is</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">because of the expected financial</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:31.119" style="s2">returns</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">but usually this is very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.119" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">test in the data</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s very difficult to test</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">because we very rarely see</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">strong changes in the rates of returns</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">to education yes we have some</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">indications that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">the returns to education increase over</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">the last 20 or 30 years in the us</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.480" style="s2">whether or not people study more but</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to observe</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.480" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">sharp changes in the returns to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:56.240" style="s2">education so he would see many of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">shifted away from equal sharing and some</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">of them didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">and they shifted in different time and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">so what we can do is we collected data</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">on all the high school students in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:07.200" style="s2">kibbutzim data from the ministry of</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">education and from the labor bureau of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.200" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">statistics where we can see</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">actually how seriously did kibbutz</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">members study</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">before the reform and after the reform</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.520" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">in kibbutzim that reformed late</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">in kibbutzim early and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">actually look at whether the cohorts of</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">of kibbutzim that reformed earlier start</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">to take more seriously once the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:30.559" style="s2">reform and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">basically one the first thing we find is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.559" end="01:00:34.319" style="s2">that yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">once the ki boots reform high school</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">students start to have to get better</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:38.960" style="s2">grades</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">they are more likely to get a</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.960" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">matriculation certificate and more</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">likely to continue</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">into higher education and then we ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">the question what happens</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">to people who were young adults at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">time the dirty boots reform</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:56.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we find that they start</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">to shift away from humanities again and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.720" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">towards sciences</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">and that was suggestive that maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">returns to education</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">aren&#39;t everything but it&#39;s certainly the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">case that once the returns to education</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:09.920" style="s2">kibbutz members still boot students</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:12.000" style="s2">start to take school more seriously and</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.920" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">kibbutz members become more likely</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.000" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">to acquire education in fields that</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">offer higher financial</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">returns makes sense another one i found</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">very interesting is that you studied the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">impact of</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">inequality with respect to the number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.559" end="01:01:28.079" style="s2">children families chose to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a very interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.079" end="01:01:31.599" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not one of my studies i</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:34.319" style="s2">described this study in my book but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.599" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">a study by abby ebenstein and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.319" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">and moshe hasan and a number of authors</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:40.480" style="s2">in the from the hebrew university</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">where they look at what happens once the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.480" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">kibbutz shift away from equal sharing to</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">the number of children</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">and the idea again is if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:51.119" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:53.200" style="s2">a in a fully egalitarian kibbutz it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.119" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">cheaper to raise your own children yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.200" end="01:01:56.400" style="s2">so imagine that you you</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">whether you have two children or four</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.400" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">children or six children uh if you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.799" end="01:02:02.880" style="s2">an equal share anyway</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.319" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">then it&#39;s less expensive to raise</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">children and so they test</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">this idea and find that uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">once key would seem shift away from</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">equal sharing you start to see a decline</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">and families have to pay for their for</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:18.839" style="s2">raising their own children</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">they start to see fewer number of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.839" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">children interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">another study again i don&#39;t remember was</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">yours or somebody else&#39;s was you were</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">able to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">a or someone was able to do a measure of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">work ethic</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">and how that varied with inequality yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">so so the work ethic is that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">gets us to the more</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">suggestive world rather than conclusive</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.000" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">world because but it&#39;s based on that</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">on some surveys of public opinion in</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">kibbutzim you see some suggestive</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">evidence although here we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">clean design that i was describing to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:50.559" style="s2">you earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">comparing kibbutzim data from earlier</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.559" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">and later and things like this this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:56.720" style="s2">just suggestive evidence that shows</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">that on the one hand the self-reported</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.720" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">work ethics</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">seems to be higher in kibbutzim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:02.559" style="s2">reformed</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">then in kibusi they didn&#39;t reform</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">suggesting that maybe work ethics</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">improved although at the same time if</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">you when you ask people about</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:12.720" style="s2">how they feel about the social life and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:14.559" style="s2">the social atmosphere in the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.720" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">you see that the more egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.559" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">kibbutzim actually have a higher</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">reported degree of happiness from their</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">social life and so again</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.319" style="s2">indicating that it&#39;s a trade-off you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">know between incentives and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.319" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">you know like an inequality yeah you got</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.039" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">my next one i was going to ask you about</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:32.160" style="s2">which was the happiness rating and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a trade-off between work ethic and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.160" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">happiness</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.960" end="01:03:38.240" style="s2">right yeah why is that not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:41.839" style="s2">and of course the the magnitude of some</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">of the efficiencies that were squeezed</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.839" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">out by these reforms were quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.039" end="01:03:45.119" style="s2">substantial i think i recall reading</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.119" end="01:03:48.559" style="s2">in some kibbutz the electricity use went</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">down 40</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">when people had to start paying for it</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">right and there were you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">significant savings in food</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">when for instance you know people either</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">had to pay for the food or they</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">outsourced</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:01.599" style="s2">the dining hall to companies that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">optimized in running dining halls things</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:04.079" style="s2">of that sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">yeah but at the same time i remember you</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.079" end="01:04:08.799" style="s2">know when i started to visit my</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">my uncles and aunts later after the he</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">was reformed in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">i remember that there was a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.480" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">which the neighbors that</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">befall were so important and and it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:20.720" style="s2">very important social aspect of life</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:22.559" style="s2">and there was some disillusion at first</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.720" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">of like oh you know before i appreciated</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.559" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">you because you</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">actually earned the same as me even</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">though you you you were the secretary of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:30.880" style="s2">the kibbutz but now you earn more for it</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.880" style="s2">so why should i appreciate it</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.880" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">but i so there was some period in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.880" end="01:04:36.880" style="s2">especially the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">the older generation the one that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.880" end="01:04:42.640" style="s2">really love the idea of the reform</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:42.880" style="s2">felt that there is a sacrifice in terms</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.640" end="01:04:45.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.880" end="01:04:47.359" style="s2">uh in terms of happiness and in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.839" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">the social atmosphere but i do think</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.359" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">that there is a revival in kibbutzim now</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:53.440" style="s2">and both kibbutzim that were formed in</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:55.520" style="s2">kibbutzim that didn&#39;t reform</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.440" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">they now have good social life and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.520" end="01:05:00.400" style="s2">are all happy and even kibbutzim that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.920" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">did reform by the way they are still</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.400" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">based on mutual aid and mutual</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">assistance and</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:06.799" style="s2">and the equality and helping others is</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">still a building block</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.799" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s still important to them even if</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">they shifted away from equal sharing so</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">the kibbutzim did get to a sweet spot</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">whether or not they reformed</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">and and and they are an example of how</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">if you&#39;re flexible enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">to respond to the changing world around</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">you you can actually make a quality</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">work for you that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">getting a little short on time i would</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:31.920" style="s2">kind of like to have jumped into where</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">things are today but</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.920" end="01:05:38.400" style="s2">let&#39;s instead go to how your insights</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.079" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">provide some information about other</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:42.319" style="s2">attempts at communal living around the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">world and through history</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.319" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">yes so again if you are me you risk</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.760" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">you risk seeing kibbutzim everywhere so</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">while they are only in israel and only a</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">small percentage i think that i see</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">elements of kibbutzim</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">in many places so we talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">social countries that the social</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:02.160" style="s2">democratic countries i see elements of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">kibbutzim i see elements of kibbutzim in</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.160" end="01:06:04.640" style="s2">developing countries in village</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:06.960" style="s2">economies</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.640" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">i see them in even in organic in</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.960" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">partnerships that are based on more</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">revenue sharing</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:15.280" style="s2">i see them in the in the arguments about</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.960" end="01:06:17.760" style="s2">between democrats and republicans about</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.280" end="01:06:19.440" style="s2">high taxes versus low taxes if you want</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.760" end="01:06:21.440" style="s2">the egalitarian ki boot is a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.440" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">percent tax rate i see them everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.440" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">but i think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">if we are short on time maybe i will say</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:29.440" style="s2">that uh the the general lessons from the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">kibbutz are maybe even broader than</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.440" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">than each of the examples the way the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">way i see them if i circle back to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:37.599" style="s2">question of like</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">could we create an egalitarian society</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.599" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">and what we learn from kibbutzim about</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:44.720" style="s2">it i think that my</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:45.680" style="s2">my lesson is that yes full equality is</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.680" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">but it has a price it is possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:52.799" style="s2">because kibbu teams survived for</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:55.280" style="s2">more than a hundred years and they are</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">one of the most important social</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:06:59.599" style="s2">experiments in equal sharing and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">survived for a long time and they were</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.599" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">it is possible because even today in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:07.039" style="s2">21st century there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:09.119" style="s2">30 or 40 kibbutzim that are still based</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:11.520" style="s2">on full equal sharing</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.119" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">and it is possible because even reformed</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">kibbutzim are still taking care of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">weak and the old members and they are</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:20.720" style="s2">based on from their safety net</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">and and otherwise on their mutual aid</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.720" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">and assistance</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">but but i think that but it has a price</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">in the sense that kibbutzim a small</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">community full equality has a price</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:32.720" style="s2">because he would seem a small community</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">and when you try to implement equality</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.720" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">and socialism</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:38.559" style="s2">at the country level you very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">get like a soviet union or something</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.559" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">with heavy restrictions on individual</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.640" style="s2">freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">otherwise it has a price because of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.640" end="01:07:48.160" style="s2">we talked about that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:50.079" style="s2">lack of privacy and common property that</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.160" end="01:07:51.039" style="s2">was so important to deal with incentive</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.079" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">are also sacrifices that many of many</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:56.480" style="s2">people are not willing to make and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">explains why they are</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.480" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">so rare and again it is has a price</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">because of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:04.720" style="s2">the screening in entering to the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">means that the equality inside the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.720" end="01:08:10.240" style="s2">kibbutz does come at the price of</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.119" end="01:08:13.839" style="s2">excluding many others from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.240" end="01:08:14.960" style="s2">quality arrangement that&#39;s all useful</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.839" end="01:08:17.839" style="s2">insights you also</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.960" end="01:08:19.600" style="s2">look with some care at some examples in</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.839" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">the united states which despite its</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.600" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">you know capitalist roots has also</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:26.000" style="s2">always been a hotbed of utopian style</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">communes right</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.000" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">you looked at some non-religious ones</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">most of which failed as i understand and</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">then you look in some detail at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">hutterites which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:36.480" style="s2">very successful but rather extreme</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">example maybe you could talk a little</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.480" end="01:08:40.960" style="s2">bit about both the non-religious</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">utopian ones and ones like the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.960" end="01:08:44.799" style="s2">hutterites</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:46.719" style="s2">yes so i have a chapter in the book</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.799" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">about the stability of communes and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.719" end="01:08:49.600" style="s2">find many</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:52.239" style="s2">many of the inherent problems associated</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.600" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">with equal sharing of resources that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.239" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">very similar in kibutim and other</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:56.640" style="s2">community it did mean that most communes</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">in history</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.640" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">have been short-lived and communes that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.279" style="s2">were better able to structure themselves</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.279" end="01:09:09.199" style="s2">lasted longer and were more successful</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.480" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">religious communes for example ended up</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.199" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">being more successful than</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:15.600" style="s2">than secular ones often times there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:17.520" style="s2">interesting work by ovid and by</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.600" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">and by by sources about about these</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.520" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">religious communes</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">and others i find that one</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:26.080" style="s2">characteristics of short-lived communes</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:27.920" style="s2">is that members did not share</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">ideological training and had very</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.920" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">different backgrounds</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">and many communes that collapsed early</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.400" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">were forming a haste or with little</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">ideological preparation</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">and so on so the brotherhood of</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:40.560" style="s2">cooperative and the new harmony and</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:43.440" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.560" end="01:09:45.520" style="s2">other communes that were more long-lived</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.440" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">had more shared ideology</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.520" end="01:09:49.920" style="s2">they were able to adjust their structure</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">as lives around them changed like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.920" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">hutterites and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:56.400" style="s2">ammanna and the shakers and others</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.560" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">and one of the interesting things that i</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.400" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">find there is that as the society around</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">so if you think if you focus on</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">successful communes for example</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">you look at what happens when society</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:07.120" style="s2">around them changes and you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:09.920" style="s2">typically the way it works is there is</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.120" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">modernization in society out around you</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.920" end="01:10:13.360" style="s2">the returns to skill in the outside</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">world increases</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.360" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">and it becomes more difficult to sustain</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">your commune what do you do</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:22.000" style="s2">and so if you want the successful</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.679" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">communist took one of two</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.000" end="01:10:26.719" style="s2">ways one is the kibbutz way the kibbutz</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">way is you become more like society</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.719" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">around you so you&#39;re like oh my okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.640" end="01:10:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming more difficult to sustain</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">full equality because people want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.480" end="01:10:36.080" style="s2">live then why don&#39;t we become somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:38.239" style="s2">less egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">and we offer members more options like</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.239" end="01:10:41.199" style="s2">society around us</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:42.880" style="s2">there is also another way that</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.199" end="01:10:44.800" style="s2">successful communities</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.880" end="01:10:46.880" style="s2">have taken which is to become more</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.800" end="01:10:49.760" style="s2">inward looking if you want so</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.880" end="01:10:52.159" style="s2">rather to become even to stick more to</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.760" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">your original principles maybe to not</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.159" end="01:10:55.440" style="s2">allow</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:57.679" style="s2">your members to see what their outside</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.440" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">option and how the outside world is like</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.679" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">this is maybe more a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:02.640" style="s2">like the hatterite example</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:04.159" style="s2">yeah of course the hutterites are</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.640" end="01:11:05.679" style="s2">physically quite remote and they even</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.159" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">speak their own language right sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.679" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">dialect of german as i understand it</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">yes and that makes it more difficult for</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:13.280" style="s2">me for people to</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">evaluate how successful they might be in</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">the outside world for example if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">decide to leave</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:20.719" style="s2">yeah though i will say those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:22.640" style="s2">things strikes me as more cult-like than</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:24.480" style="s2">healthy societies where you</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.640" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">try to isolate people make it really</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.480" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">difficult to exit etc</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">yeah but many of them but many of them</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:30.480" style="s2">have but you know to be fair and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.600" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">know this is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.480" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">you should really in my book when in</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:36.159" style="s2">others they have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">adapting themselves to the changes in</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.159" end="01:11:39.920" style="s2">the modern world and they have</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:41.440" style="s2">been doing it in such a way that many of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.920" end="01:11:43.199" style="s2">their members and even the young ones</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.440" end="01:11:45.040" style="s2">are happy about and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.199" end="01:11:46.239" style="s2">they are doing their best to adopt as</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.040" end="01:11:48.640" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.239" end="01:11:49.600" style="s2">okay sort of a last topic here before we</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.640" end="01:11:52.080" style="s2">wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.600" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">you know between radical capitalism on</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.080" end="01:11:55.440" style="s2">one side and</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:57.120" style="s2">equal sharing on the other there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.440" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">of other settings you know one i</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.120" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">stumbled across in my reading of various</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.920" end="01:12:03.679" style="s2">books on the kibbutz movement was a</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.440" end="01:12:06.080" style="s2">movement in israel called moshav i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.679" end="01:12:07.280" style="s2">it is where individual family units</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.080" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">operate their farms with their</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.280" end="01:12:10.560" style="s2">businesses but they cooperate in</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:12.800" style="s2">marketing and buying</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.560" end="01:12:13.679" style="s2">the amish and mennonites do that to some</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.800" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.679" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">in the united states we have things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">co-ops employee-owned co-ops</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">and we have companies that have large</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:23.280" style="s2">amounts of profit sharing etc</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.440" end="01:12:25.600" style="s2">what are some of the broader lessons</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.280" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">from your work about thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.600" end="01:12:29.440" style="s2">how to increase egalitarianism in</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:32.159" style="s2">society in general</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">without necessarily going all the way to</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.159" end="01:12:36.719" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:38.880" style="s2">subdunbar number units we can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.719" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">the examples that that you gave</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.880" end="01:12:42.880" style="s2">the moshav and the cooperatives but i</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:44.800" style="s2">think that if in the last couple you</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.880" end="01:12:46.880" style="s2">know i think i would focus even on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.800" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">on the bigger picture on like society in</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.880" end="01:12:50.480" style="s2">general and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.159" style="s2">what one of the things that the broader</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.480" end="01:12:54.320" style="s2">lessons that i learned uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.159" end="01:12:56.560" style="s2">and and the way i want to relate it to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.320" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">to lessons to other societies</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.560" end="01:13:02.400" style="s2">is that in a world where</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:04.800" style="s2">there is such an increase such a rising</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.400" end="01:13:06.560" style="s2">income inequality and in the united</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.800" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">states today you know the top</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.560" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">one percent owns i don&#39;t know like 30</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.199" style="s2">percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:15.679" style="s2">of the of the wealth it is very natural</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.199" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">that people start to ask themselves the</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.679" end="01:13:18.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:19.679" style="s2">of whether and how we can create more</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:22.640" style="s2">equal</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.679" end="01:13:24.960" style="s2">sharing societies then at some level the</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.640" end="01:13:26.640" style="s2">kibbutz the way i viewed it in my book</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.960" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">and in my research is that it is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.640" end="01:13:31.120" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:32.640" style="s2">of a social experiment that went exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.120" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">the other way so it went</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.640" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">to the full equality way and</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:40.560" style="s2">nevertheless was able to be successful</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">subject to sacrificing in privacy</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.560" end="01:13:44.000" style="s2">and in some other way but if the key</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:44.840" style="s2">boots as a full equal sharing was able</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.000" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.840" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">successful but probably not in a way</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:52.480" style="s2">that most people would like to live in</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:53.679" style="s2">but there are egalitarian societies and</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.480" end="01:13:55.520" style="s2">countries like again</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.679" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">i&#39;m always thinking norway and sweden</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.520" end="01:14:00.560" style="s2">and the nordic model</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">that were able to successfully take some</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.560" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">of what</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.120" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">many of us instinctively feel is good</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:07.600" style="s2">about equality</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:09.600" style="s2">and about having making sure that people</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">have sufficient living and they</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.600" end="01:14:13.440" style="s2">there is no poverty there is a generous</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:16.159" style="s2">welfare state you don&#39;t let people</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.440" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">die of hunger and the people in general</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.159" end="01:14:18.640" style="s2">feel that they are happy and having</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:21.120" style="s2">fulfilled life</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.640" end="01:14:23.600" style="s2">with the market forces because you know</p>
