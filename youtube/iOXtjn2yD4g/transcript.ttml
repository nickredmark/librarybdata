<p begin="00:00:17.210" end="00:00:23.660" style="s2">okay so I&#39;m here today to give a talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">about money and our monetary system and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.660" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">what I want to do is talk first of all</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">about how money is created there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:31.470" style="s2">three different kinds of money I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:33.570" style="s2">briefly talk about each one but I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">to particularly focus on commercial bank</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.570" end="00:00:37.890" style="s2">money because that is over ninety seven</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:40.649" style="s2">percent of the money supply is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">commercial bank money and that is really</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.649" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">that&#39;s a hub that at the hub of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">monetary system so I don&#39;t explain where</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">it where money comes from how it works</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">and how it is used to transfer wealth</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">from the poor in everything it never to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">be up to the rich how it inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">creates unpayable debt which we all then</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">have to pay off using our labor using</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">our work using our love and our</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">creativity basically giving our lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">away to the man so first of all what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:08.250" style="s2">money like I said there are three</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">different kinds of money the first kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.250" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">of money is government money this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">cash this is the notes and coins that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">we&#39;re all familiar with in circulation</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">what we all you know think of as money</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">but actually this only account for about</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:23.189" style="s2">two-and-a-half percent of our total</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">money supply so government money is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.189" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">printed at the Royal Mint and then those</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:30.390" style="s2">notes and coins are sold through the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">commercial banks and and circulated</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">through the commercial high excellences</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">it&#39;s important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">government money is issued it&#39;s paid for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">and it goes into circulation</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">it is not gathering interest it is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:46.140" style="s2">owned to anyone by anyone this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">debt-free money interest free money but</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.140" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">like I said this is only about two and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">half percent of the total money in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">circulation the other 97% is commercial</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">bank money I&#39;m going to talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">that in just a minute but just before I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">do let me talk about the third kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">money first kind of money is central</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">bank money we don&#39;t ever see that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:06.549" style="s2">central bank money is held in the Bank</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:08.920" style="s2">of England and is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.549" end="00:02:11.260" style="s2">at the end of each trading day to settle</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.920" end="00:02:13.269" style="s2">accounts between the commercial banks</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.260" end="00:02:14.620" style="s2">commercial bank money this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.269" end="00:02:17.080" style="s2">want to spend most of my time because</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.620" end="00:02:19.239" style="s2">this is the really evil part of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.080" end="00:02:21.129" style="s2">monetary system if you have a banking</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:23.019" style="s2">license you are granted the permission</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.129" end="00:02:26.379" style="s2">through your brother permission to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.019" end="00:02:28.269" style="s2">create money in response to a loan so a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.379" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">customer goes into a bank and they want</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.269" end="00:02:31.810" style="s2">to borrow a hundred thousand pounds to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:34.180" style="s2">buy a house the bank in response to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.810" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">those needs for that loan create house</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.180" end="00:02:39.099" style="s2">of thin air a hundred thousand brand-new</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:41.140" style="s2">signee pounds not notes and coins it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.099" end="00:02:43.060" style="s2">just a bookkeeping entry they tap a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.140" end="00:02:45.610" style="s2">hundred thousand pounds credit into your</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.060" end="00:02:47.769" style="s2">bank account and at the same time you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.610" end="00:02:49.390" style="s2">now have created a debt with the bank</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.769" end="00:02:51.790" style="s2">you owe the bank one hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.390" end="00:02:54.670" style="s2">pounds plus the interest over the period</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.790" end="00:02:56.860" style="s2">of time and that under our commercial</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.670" end="00:02:59.049" style="s2">banking system money and debt are in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.860" end="00:03:02.829" style="s2">fact the same thing money given to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.049" end="00:03:05.620" style="s2">by the bank is equal to debt owed by you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.829" end="00:03:07.329" style="s2">to the bank so money equals that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.620" end="00:03:09.160" style="s2">really important concept to remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.329" end="00:03:10.780" style="s2">here I&#39;m going to come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.160" end="00:03:12.850" style="s2">theme again and again during the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.780" end="00:03:15.100" style="s2">renewing the course of my talk so you go</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.850" end="00:03:16.510" style="s2">to the bank and you borrow 100,000</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.100" end="00:03:18.910" style="s2">pounds I will represent that hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.510" end="00:03:21.489" style="s2">thousand pounds as that block you now</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.910" end="00:03:23.350" style="s2">owe the bank one hundred thousand pounds</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.489" end="00:03:24.670" style="s2">they have a debt owed to them four</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.350" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">hundred thousand pounds now believe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.670" end="00:03:28.120" style="s2">or not once the bank lends you that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:29.950" style="s2">money which remember they never had in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.120" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">the first place they&#39;ve created it out</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.950" end="00:03:35.349" style="s2">of thin air that debt now becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:36.819" style="s2">asset of the bank believe it or not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.349" end="00:03:38.470" style="s2">they are owed this money</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.819" end="00:03:40.329" style="s2">barefoot becomes an asset of the bank</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.470" end="00:03:42.190" style="s2">now they&#39;ve lend you that money and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.329" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">on top of that loan you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.190" end="00:03:47.260" style="s2">to pay interest so the debt is bigger</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">than the amount of money lent you write</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.260" end="00:03:51.489" style="s2">this is the amount of money in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:53.739" style="s2">circulation this is the debt oh another</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.489" end="00:03:55.720" style="s2">person comes along bros 100,000 pounds</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.720" end="00:04:00.880" style="s2">plus the interest on that hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.329" end="00:04:03.489" style="s2">thousand pounds you can see that as more</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.880" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">and more money is lent the difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.489" end="00:04:08.410" style="s2">between the money lent and the money</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.790" style="s2">owed is forever getting bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.410" end="00:04:11.380" style="s2">bigger and bigger you can see on these</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.790" end="00:04:14.079" style="s2">two bars there&#39;s now three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.380" end="00:04:15.820" style="s2">thousand pounds in circulation but</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.079" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">there&#39;s four or five hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.820" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">pounds</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">fruit this is one of the crucial things</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.540" end="00:04:26.669" style="s2">to understand about our monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:29.639" style="s2">is that there is never enough money in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.669" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">circulation to cover all of the debt</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.639" end="00:04:34.980" style="s2">which is owed as at 2010 this will blow</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:36.750" style="s2">your mind and if it doesn&#39;t blow your</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.980" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">mind you&#39;re not fully understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t mean that to sound</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:44.120" style="s2">patronizing but that&#39;s that decayed as</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:48.389" style="s2">of 2010 around the world global debt</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.120" end="00:04:52.140" style="s2">total global debt was 180 trillion</p>

<p begin="00:04:55.380" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">trillion dollars so I was at 2010 this</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:03.030" style="s2">problem here with because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:05.190" style="s2">interest you on debt this problem here</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.030" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">of debt being bigger than money in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.190" end="00:05:09.240" style="s2">circulation has got to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:12.390" style="s2">there was in 2010</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.240" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">100 and trillion dollars 110 sorry</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.390" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">trillion dollars around the world of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">debt which simply cannot be paid because</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:21.660" style="s2">the money to pay it does not exist right</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like a game of musical chairs</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.660" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">you&#39;ve got three chairs in the game but</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.840" end="00:05:29.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve got five players in the game two</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.940" end="00:05:30.540" style="s2">of those players when the music stops</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.190" end="00:05:32.419" style="s2">two of those players are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.540" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">left out in the cold in other words</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.419" end="00:05:37.350" style="s2">defaults bankruptcies people not being</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.350" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">not being able to service their debt</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.580" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">this kind of thing is inevitable because</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:46.380" style="s2">the interest payments soon get to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">point you know you&#39;ve got so much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.380" end="00:05:51.750" style="s2">debt than money in circulation that some</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:53.820" style="s2">people must default on their debt now</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.750" end="00:05:55.910" style="s2">what happens when a debt is paid when a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.820" end="00:05:59.100" style="s2">debt is paid and then that&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.910" end="00:06:01.080" style="s2">money and debt because they&#39;re opposites</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.100" end="00:06:03.539" style="s2">of each other when you pay off your debt</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.080" end="00:06:05.580" style="s2">the money is destroyed the money in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.580" end="00:06:10.770" style="s2">paid money is destroyed so all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.610" end="00:06:12.060" style="s2">nonsense they talk you hear on the news</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.770" end="00:06:14.250" style="s2">government representatives the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.060" end="00:06:16.260" style="s2">Chancellor of Exchequer even doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.250" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">understand this basic point it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.260" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">impossible to reduce the deficit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.770" style="s2">impossible to pay off the national debt</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:26.310" style="s2">because the money to do so simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.770" end="00:06:27.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist the only way to keep up</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.310" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">with the ever expanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.960" end="00:06:32.729" style="s2">interest payments on this unpayable that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.889" style="s2">is to create ever more and ever more</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.729" end="00:06:36.569" style="s2">money and of course as you create more</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.889" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">money you&#39;re creating more debt</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.569" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">alongside that money you can never ever</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:43.470" style="s2">ever get ahead of the curve and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:44.699" style="s2">mean it&#39;s impossible in the sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.470" end="00:06:46.199" style="s2">know it&#39;s not actually impossible I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.699" end="00:06:49.190" style="s2">the actual dictionary definition of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.199" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">impossible it simply cannot be done</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.190" end="00:06:54.150" style="s2">right so that&#39;s consequence number one</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:56.789" style="s2">is debt slavery sorry its consequence</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.150" end="00:06:59.160" style="s2">number one is unpayable debt being built</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.789" end="00:07:02.190" style="s2">up in the economy consequence number two</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.160" end="00:07:04.530" style="s2">is that though real wealth in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.190" end="00:07:07.470" style="s2">economy always being transferred from</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.530" end="00:07:12.199" style="s2">poor people to rich people from ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.470" end="00:07:12.199" style="s2">working folk to the banks how do they</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.830" end="00:07:16.979" style="s2">write okay if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:19.169" style="s2">to talk a little bit about solutions at</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.979" end="00:07:20.970" style="s2">the end if you don&#39;t mind but yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.169" end="00:07:22.229" style="s2">you may know this I think there are an</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.970" end="00:07:24.330" style="s2">awful lot of people out there that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.229" end="00:07:26.069" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to elucidate the problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.330" end="00:07:27.960" style="s2">first and then I&#39;ll talk about some one</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.069" end="00:07:31.020" style="s2">possible there are a wide range of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.960" end="00:07:33.389" style="s2">possible solutions like for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.020" end="00:07:36.030" style="s2">universal basic income you know removing</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.389" end="00:07:37.530" style="s2">the need for giving your labor to sister</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.030" end="00:07:39.270" style="s2">to sustain the basic essentials of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.530" end="00:07:41.159" style="s2">as I say there are lots of ideas out</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.270" end="00:07:42.449" style="s2">there none of them are perfect they all</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.159" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">have their good points in there bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.449" end="00:07:46.139" style="s2">point I&#39;m just saying that until lots of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:48.419" style="s2">people are aware of the problems and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.139" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">understand the need to find solutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.419" end="00:07:54.780" style="s2">and the sorry say again sit for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:56.550" style="s2">thousands of years I know but what stood</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.780" end="00:07:58.380" style="s2">between now and any time in history is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.550" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">our ability to communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.380" end="00:08:01.560" style="s2">other a large scale anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.180" style="s2">world instantly by the internet we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.560" end="00:08:04.949" style="s2">never had the internet before right</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.180" end="00:08:06.690" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s different now and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.949" end="00:08:08.490" style="s2">what gives me possible hope for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.690" end="00:08:10.380" style="s2">future is that we can find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.490" end="00:08:12.539" style="s2">collaborate with each other on a large</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.380" end="00:08:14.520" style="s2">scale independently the banks and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.539" end="00:08:17.009" style="s2">government&#39;s and hopefully make them</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.520" end="00:08:18.870" style="s2">irrelevant and obsolete that&#39;s yet short</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.009" end="00:08:20.820" style="s2">I realize it seems like a bit of a pipe</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.870" end="00:08:22.650" style="s2">dream but if you can&#39;t even hope for it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.820" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t even conceive it what hope do</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.650" end="00:08:26.099" style="s2">you ever have of bringing it into</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">reality do you not I mean so can we try</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.099" end="00:08:29.310" style="s2">and be a bit up being a bit hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:30.870" style="s2">rather than negative right because if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.310" end="00:08:32.430" style="s2">say there&#39;s nothing we can do then for</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.870" end="00:08:33.719" style="s2">sure we&#39;re never going to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.430" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">you know what I mean you understand I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.719" end="00:08:38.579" style="s2">saying right anyway so next thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">transference of wealth from the poor to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.579" end="00:08:41.810" style="s2">the rich inevitably because think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:44.750" style="s2">it who has money to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.810" end="00:08:46.850" style="s2">rich people who needs money poor people</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.750" end="00:08:49.400" style="s2">so what ends up happening is poor people</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.850" end="00:08:51.529" style="s2">pay interest to rich people making poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.400" end="00:08:53.860" style="s2">people ever poorer and rich people ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.529" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">rich I&#39;m just a little just a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.860" end="00:08:59.089" style="s2">stacked to reinforce that idea about</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:02.150" style="s2">transferring real wealth from the poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.089" end="00:09:04.460" style="s2">to the rich in 1960 the top 20% of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.150" end="00:09:07.790" style="s2">people had 30 times the wealth of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.460" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">bottom 20% in 1998 that ratio increased</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.790" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">to 74 times in the u.s. in 90 2007 the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:17.540" style="s2">top 1% own 42 percent of the nation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:19.460" style="s2">wealth the bottom 80% between them own 7</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.540" end="00:09:21.260" style="s2">percent just a couple of months ago in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.460" end="00:09:23.089" style="s2">the news there was the stat about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.260" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">richest 8 people in the world now have</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.089" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">as much wealth as the poorest 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:29.779" style="s2">of the people in the world so this gap</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:31.370" style="s2">this inequality gap between rich and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.779" end="00:09:33.890" style="s2">poor has been growing larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.370" end="00:09:35.960" style="s2">and it is inevitable this is not about</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.890" end="00:09:38.470" style="s2">really people taking more for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.960" end="00:09:41.000" style="s2">this is systemic it is not it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.470" end="00:09:43.160" style="s2">unavoidable under this monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.000" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">for this wealth gap between rich and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.160" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">poor to increase forever it simply can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:47.960" style="s2">be stopped</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.740" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">third consequence of our monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.960" end="00:09:51.820" style="s2">because we&#39;re constantly creating new</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:54.470" style="s2">money and bringing it into circulation</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.820" end="00:09:56.210" style="s2">all of that new money has to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.470" end="00:09:59.030" style="s2">somewhere right it has to be spent</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.210" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">somewhere and so two things about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.030" end="00:10:04.010" style="s2">firstly inflation we are taught we tend</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.420" end="00:10:06.920" style="s2">to think about inflation as being about</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.010" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">rising prices it&#39;s not that is a sip not</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.920" end="00:10:11.000" style="s2">a cause and inflation the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:13.580" style="s2">inflation is the constantly expanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.000" end="00:10:15.020" style="s2">number of pounds in circulation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.580" end="00:10:16.940" style="s2">increasing the number of pounds flowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.020" end="00:10:18.200" style="s2">around then you&#39;ve got to do one of two</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.940" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">things you either have to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.200" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">number of goods and services available</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.670" end="00:10:24.260" style="s2">in the economy or the price of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.220" end="00:10:25.610" style="s2">existing goods and services has to go up</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.260" end="00:10:27.620" style="s2">to reflect the extra money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.610" end="00:10:29.089" style="s2">circulating about this is called</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.620" end="00:10:30.470" style="s2">inflation when prices go up this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.089" end="00:10:32.600" style="s2">called inflation but it&#39;s a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.470" end="00:10:34.700" style="s2">of an expanding money supply not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.600" end="00:10:37.520" style="s2">consequence of rising prices the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.700" end="00:10:39.320" style="s2">thing and more importantly if if a bank</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.520" end="00:10:41.540" style="s2">is deciding where they&#39;re going to lend</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.320" end="00:10:44.180" style="s2">their money they decide where money is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.540" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">being spent in society they do not lend</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.180" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">money on high risk they do not lend</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:50.810" style="s2">money on high risk ventures they will</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.860" end="00:10:52.570" style="s2">lend money on Shore things and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.810" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">happened positive easing</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.570" end="00:10:56.500" style="s2">and the bailout money to the banks where</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.150" style="s2">did that go did that go on</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.500" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">infrastructure development does that go</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.150" end="00:11:01.840" style="s2">on transportation if you&#39;re lowering</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:03.580" style="s2">transportation costs or energy cost of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.840" end="00:11:05.710" style="s2">people did that go on building more</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.580" end="00:11:07.930" style="s2">social housing it didn&#39;t go on any of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.710" end="00:11:09.460" style="s2">those things it went on reinflates in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.930" end="00:11:10.840" style="s2">the housing markets we&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.460" end="00:11:12.790" style="s2">housing bubble that we&#39;re now in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.840" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">midst of it went to inflation the stock</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.790" end="00:11:16.300" style="s2">market&#39;s record highs and it went to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:18.760" style="s2">speculating on the foreign exchange</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.220" end="00:11:36.940" style="s2">of that money floating around is being</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.590" end="00:11:55.570" style="s2">but for some reason my mind is blanking</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.690" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">today and sorry say again yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.570" end="00:11:59.770" style="s2">then yeah finally is the concept of debt</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:02.080" style="s2">slavery and this is this is really what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.770" end="00:12:04.690" style="s2">I&#39;m all about is we are slaves to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.080" end="00:12:07.930" style="s2">banks here basically every minute that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.690" end="00:12:09.370" style="s2">you work you are working primarily for</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.930" end="00:12:11.770" style="s2">the banks you get to keep very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.370" end="00:12:13.450" style="s2">little of your own bit bearing in mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.770" end="00:12:15.340" style="s2">at the banks can make money out of thin</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.450" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">air right so they are taking no risk</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.340" end="00:12:17.620" style="s2">when they lend you a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:19.270" style="s2">pounds to buy your health they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.620" end="00:12:20.020" style="s2">taking no risk they&#39;re creating money</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.270" end="00:12:21.430" style="s2">out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.020" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">they didn&#39;t own the money as property in</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.430" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">the first place right if you default on</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:26.950" style="s2">your mortgage they take the house they</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">take the whole house including any</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.950" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">deposit you pay including any increase</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:31.330" style="s2">in value of the house including any</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">mortgage payments you&#39;ve made so far</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.330" end="00:12:35.230" style="s2">they take the whole house from you not</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:40.060" style="s2">only the unpaid portion of it they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.230" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2">taking no risk here so what you do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.060" end="00:12:43.180" style="s2">go and borrow money from the bank but</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">you have to repay that money with real</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.180" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">labor with real time with real love they</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:51.430" style="s2">are essentially stealing your life away</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:53.560" style="s2">from you turning it into a debt and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.430" end="00:12:56.230" style="s2">making you spend your life repaying that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.560" end="00:12:59.170" style="s2">debt to them debt based currency is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.230" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">simply a path to slavery I don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.170" end="00:13:01.650" style="s2">mean on</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:04.020" style="s2">individual-level this happens at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.650" end="00:13:06.960" style="s2">governmental level as well we&#39;ve now got</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.020" end="00:13:09.180" style="s2">into a situation where bank assets are</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.960" end="00:13:12.570" style="s2">some five hundred and fifty percent of</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.960" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">of global GDP what this means it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">most of those assets are government</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">bonds what you&#39;ve got is commercial</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">banks creating money out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:33.630" style="s2">lending them back to national</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.960" end="00:13:44.970" style="s2">did you know and again this will blow</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.270" end="00:13:47.370" style="s2">your mind did you know that 90% of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.970" end="00:13:50.190" style="s2">income tax revenue collected by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.370" end="00:13:52.080" style="s2">Treasury goes to paying interest on the</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.020" end="00:14:01.740" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about income tax revenue</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.340" end="00:14:04.230" style="s2">ninety percent of income tax revenue</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.740" end="00:14:07.110" style="s2">goes towards paying interest on loans</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.230" end="00:14:09.690" style="s2">from commercial banks the government is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.110" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">paying interest to commercial banks for</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.410" end="00:14:23.160" style="s2">money but the commercial banks are</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.089" end="00:14:24.810" style="s2">creating funny money out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.160" end="00:14:27.089" style="s2">lending it back to government in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.810" end="00:14:29.070" style="s2">hundreds of billions in trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.089" end="00:14:30.630" style="s2">dollars and government are now paying</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.070" end="00:14:33.630" style="s2">interest on those debt through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.630" end="00:14:35.390" style="s2">taxation of its citizens the IRS sorry</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.630" end="00:14:38.520" style="s2">the Federal Reserve vote was set up in</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.390" end="00:14:40.980" style="s2">1913 the IRS the American</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.520" end="00:14:44.190" style="s2">Inland Revenue Service was also set up</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.980" end="00:14:46.110" style="s2">in 1913 right so as the Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.190" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">was set up to lend money to government</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.110" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">the government also set up a tax</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:51.690" style="s2">collection service so it could start</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:53.700" style="s2">making interest payments on the loan but</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.690" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">it was taken from a private bank the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.700" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">Federal Reserve is not a federal agency</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">it is a private bank despite what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">call themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.780" end="00:15:11.070" style="s2">correct it&#39;s owned by a cabal of private</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.850" end="00:15:13.260" style="s2">bankers so what this means is because</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.070" end="00:15:15.270" style="s2">banks are holding hundreds of billions</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.260" end="00:15:17.400" style="s2">or even trillions of government debt</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.270" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">bacon now dictate terms to government</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.400" end="00:15:20.760" style="s2">they can tell government what they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:22.200" style="s2">and can&#39;t spend money on they can tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.760" end="00:15:24.030" style="s2">government that they have to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.200" end="00:15:25.890" style="s2">cost-cutting measures right they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.030" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">tell government what they can and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.890" end="00:15:29.430" style="s2">do for their citizens</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.910" end="00:15:31.110" style="s2">so actually our governments are no</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.430" end="00:15:33.030" style="s2">longer running things even if their</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.110" end="00:15:34.890" style="s2">desire to make life better for their</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.030" end="00:15:36.900" style="s2">citizens were sincere and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.890" end="00:15:38.940" style="s2">but even if they had a sincere desire to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.900" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">make life better for their citizens they</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.940" end="00:15:43.670" style="s2">simply cannot do so because they are in</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:46.830" style="s2">hock up to their eyeballs to the banks</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.670" end="00:15:48.200" style="s2">right so the question now becomes as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.830" end="00:15:50.970" style="s2">gentleman over here was asking before</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.200" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">firstly why is it like this how does it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.970" end="00:15:54.900" style="s2">come about well it&#39;s very simple money</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.150" style="s2">men have always pulled the strings for</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.900" end="00:15:59.700" style="s2">thousands of years yeah the Pharos</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.150" end="00:16:02.340" style="s2">further the kings and queens the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.700" end="00:16:04.170" style="s2">Emperor&#39;s the conquerors you know these</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.340" end="00:16:05.820" style="s2">are all the people at the very very top</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.170" end="00:16:08.220" style="s2">of always been those that have pulled</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.820" end="00:16:09.930" style="s2">the strings this is nothing new and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">on modern banking system our modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.930" end="00:16:14.940" style="s2">modern mantra is simply a very clever</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.980" style="s2">very sophisticated way of keeping the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.940" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">population enslaved without them even</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.980" end="00:16:22.770" style="s2">knowing that they are enslaved as Johann</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.990" style="s2">Wolfgang von Goethe wrote none are so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.770" end="00:16:27.420" style="s2">hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.990" end="00:16:30.270" style="s2">believed themselves to be free and sadly</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.420" end="00:16:33.480" style="s2">that is how I see that is how I see what</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.270" end="00:16:36.270" style="s2">we are unfortunately unwitting slave to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.480" end="00:16:40.650" style="s2">the man right so solutions what we do</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.270" end="00:16:42.660" style="s2">about it and unfortunately until many</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.650" end="00:16:44.580" style="s2">many many more people see that there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.660" end="00:16:46.410" style="s2">a problem there is not going to be any</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.580" end="00:16:48.210" style="s2">serious search for solutions but there</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.410" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">are people out there we&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.210" end="00:16:50.580" style="s2">very very hard to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:53.030" style="s2">alternatives so did you hear something</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.580" end="00:16:53.030" style="s2">yeah go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.600" end="00:17:00.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a collective collective thing right</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.700" end="00:17:02.589" style="s2">so ultimately I guess it&#39;s a computer</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.100" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">kind of that&#39;s that&#39;s allocating things</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.589" end="00:17:08.650" style="s2">but it&#39;s doing so according to an agreed</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:10.390" style="s2">scheme as to what&#39;s there and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.650" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">equitable and what&#39;s needed you know to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.390" end="00:17:13.540" style="s2">me and so a large part of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:15.400" style="s2">resource-based economy is based on</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.540" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">shared access the thing not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.400" end="00:17:19.959" style="s2">has a car right you don&#39;t need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:22.089" style="s2">car 80% of the time 90% of a power cut</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.959" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">your fuel cars are parked there right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.089" end="00:17:25.329" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to own a car</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.819" style="s2">what you need is access to a car when</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.329" end="00:17:29.740" style="s2">you need one right and so again with</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.819" end="00:17:32.140" style="s2">modern systems is not difficult to set</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.740" end="00:17:34.120" style="s2">up an uber style system where you ring</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.140" end="00:17:35.740" style="s2">up a car come pick you up tastes where</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.120" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">you&#39;re going goes on picks up the next</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.740" end="00:17:37.990" style="s2">buses</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">nobody needs to own a car anyway nor me</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.990" end="00:17:43.650" style="s2">and this can apply to many many many</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:43.650" style="s2">things this concept of shared ownership</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.750" end="00:17:58.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a good example of decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.550" end="00:18:02.530" style="s2">correct exactly right in the end</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.990" end="00:18:03.450" style="s2">someone has to control as you say who</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.530" end="00:18:06.870" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.450" end="00:18:08.370" style="s2">be able to create that yeah sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.870" end="00:18:09.870" style="s2">interrupt you but you&#39;re upset and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.370" end="00:18:11.190" style="s2">is this is the number one criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.870" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">the idea of results based economy is</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.190" end="00:18:14.639" style="s2">it&#39;s still a centralized control system</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:17.299" style="s2">right and a resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.639" end="00:18:19.740" style="s2">cannot come about without us first</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.299" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">experiencing a change in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.740" end="00:18:24.090" style="s2">right where we stop seeing each other as</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">competition and we start seeing each</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.090" end="00:18:27.570" style="s2">other as brothers and sister right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.710" end="00:18:29.399" style="s2">until that comes about a resource-based</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.570" end="00:18:31.460" style="s2">economy cannot happen but for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.399" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">long-term sustainable good of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.460" end="00:18:34.889" style="s2">something along the line of resource</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:36.539" style="s2">based economy has to be has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.889" end="00:18:37.769" style="s2">way forward right even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.539" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">difficult to see it from where we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.769" end="00:18:44.370" style="s2">now yes go on well okay in what we need</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">I mean a resource-based economy or</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.370" end="00:18:48.059" style="s2">something like it I really think the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:49.860" style="s2">long-term future of mankind is where we</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.059" end="00:18:50.429" style="s2">need to end up how we get from here to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.860" end="00:18:54.889" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.429" end="00:18:54.889" style="s2">transitional solutions their replacement</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.700" end="00:18:59.700" style="s2">yeah I agree you offered you asked the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.230" end="00:19:02.340" style="s2">most difficult question and there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.700" end="00:19:05.429" style="s2">lots of transitional ideas out there so</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.340" end="00:19:07.110" style="s2">moving away from it step number one step</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.429" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">number one is to move away from a debt</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.110" end="00:19:10.940" style="s2">based monetary system yeah something is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:13.860" style="s2">not rooted in depth gold Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.940" end="00:19:15.899" style="s2">government-issued currency whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.860" end="00:19:17.490" style="s2">something which is not rooted in debt no</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.899" end="00:19:19.230" style="s2">no I agree to get straight from here to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.490" end="00:19:20.669" style="s2">a resource-based economy it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.230" end="00:19:22.710" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it in one step right there</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.669" end="00:19:24.510" style="s2">has to be a series of transition step I</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.710" end="00:19:26.669" style="s2">completely agree with you right so step</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.510" end="00:19:28.470" style="s2">number one on this road is to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.669" end="00:19:30.120" style="s2">debt based currencies and replace it</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.470" end="00:19:32.399" style="s2">with currencies which are not rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.120" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">debt which are not controlled and issued</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.399" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">by a commercial bank that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:37.649" style="s2">independent of all of that for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.990" style="s2">gold for example Bitcoin right these are</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.649" end="00:19:41.159" style="s2">outside you can&#39;t create gold you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.990" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">just make gold out of thin air right</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.159" end="00:19:44.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a finite amount of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:46.649" style="s2">same with Bitcoin you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.399" end="00:19:48.990" style="s2">something like that is it is a step on</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.649" end="00:19:51.090" style="s2">the road toward the idea of a universal</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.990" end="00:19:54.120" style="s2">basic income so that people are removed</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.090" end="00:19:56.039" style="s2">from slavery you don&#39;t have to work to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.120" end="00:19:58.230" style="s2">feed yourself to house yourself you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.039" end="00:20:00.360" style="s2">what I mean that that again is a step on</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.230" end="00:20:03.570" style="s2">the road but these are all transitions</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.360" end="00:20:05.700" style="s2">these are all ways of getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.570" end="00:20:07.710" style="s2">final goal which is no money because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.700" end="00:20:09.870" style="s2">don&#39;t need it we don&#39;t need if you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.710" end="00:20:11.399" style="s2">unfettered access to everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.870" end="00:20:13.260" style="s2">need and the freedom to follow your</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.399" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">passions and do what you want to what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.260" end="00:20:16.140" style="s2">hell&#39;s you need money for do you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:17.610" style="s2">what I mean it&#39;s like a Star Trek sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.140" end="00:20:19.470" style="s2">of thing what the hell do you need money</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.610" end="00:20:21.270" style="s2">for not necessary what I said if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.470" end="00:20:22.680" style="s2">mean example you need money for in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.270" end="00:20:26.070" style="s2">life give me an example of something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.680" end="00:20:27.150" style="s2">need money for I&#39;d say okay let me let</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.070" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">me give you an example let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.150" end="00:20:30.180" style="s2">you&#39;re a business right you want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:31.980" style="s2">build a new factory you&#39;ve got a need</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.180" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">for iguana yeah so you need money to buy</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.980" end="00:20:36.090" style="s2">the land and build the factory but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:38.550" style="s2">don&#39;t need the money what you need is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.090" end="00:20:39.810" style="s2">the space you need people to build the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.550" end="00:20:41.100" style="s2">buildings you need the material to visit</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.810" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">a building that&#39;s what you need right</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.100" end="00:20:44.850" style="s2">you need that much do you need the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:46.500" style="s2">machines to tool the factory need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.850" end="00:20:48.270" style="s2">train the workers in how to use the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.500" end="00:20:51.270" style="s2">machinery this is what you need right</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.270" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">now right now under our system money is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.270" end="00:20:55.020" style="s2">a vehicle by which you do these things</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.940" style="s2">right but you don&#39;t actually need the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.020" end="00:20:58.410" style="s2">money what you need is those things and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.940" end="00:21:00.690" style="s2">so we need to get away is this mode of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.410" end="00:21:03.780" style="s2">thinking where money directs everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.690" end="00:21:05.880" style="s2">because money is a fantasy we made it up</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.780" end="00:21:07.590" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like the boogeyman it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.880" end="00:21:09.720" style="s2">the tooth fairy&#39;s like Santa Claus here</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.590" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">we made it up and we can just as easily</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.720" end="00:21:23.040" style="s2">forget about yeah I need a little baby I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:25.410" style="s2">agree but if you live in a society where</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.040" end="00:21:27.240" style="s2">everybody is motivated simply to help</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.410" end="00:21:29.430" style="s2">each other out where they can because</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.240" end="00:21:30.780" style="s2">that&#39;s how we all live now right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.430" end="00:21:32.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.780" end="00:21:34.650" style="s2">change of consciousness I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.040" end="00:21:36.270" style="s2">about right and until we get that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.650" end="00:21:38.550" style="s2">can&#39;t get rid of money you&#39;re right we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.270" end="00:21:40.770" style="s2">need to change our thinking first then</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.550" end="00:21:42.360" style="s2">we can change those systems but that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.770" end="00:21:44.130" style="s2">up to every individual I can&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.360" end="00:21:45.810" style="s2">your thinking right every individual has</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.130" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">to take responsibility for how they act</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.810" end="00:21:49.320" style="s2">in this world how they treat the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:50.760" style="s2">around them how they treat the planet</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.320" end="00:21:52.500" style="s2">around them you don&#39;t mean every</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.760" end="00:21:54.900" style="s2">individual person must take</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.500" end="00:21:56.970" style="s2">responsibility for that and must try in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.900" end="00:21:58.830" style="s2">a gentle loving way when they see other</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.970" end="00:22:00.300" style="s2">people not doing that to try and put</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.830" end="00:22:02.460" style="s2">them on the right path in order me not</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.300" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">beat them into it not shout them into it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.460" end="00:22:06.300" style="s2">gently lovingly just try and show them</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:08.430" style="s2">because everybody has to come to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.300" end="00:22:10.410" style="s2">themselves yeah if you try and force it</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.430" end="00:22:11.309" style="s2">on people they will simply back away</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.410" end="00:22:14.549" style="s2">from it you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.309" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">yeah and so everything&#39;s yeah we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.549" end="00:22:18.779" style="s2">one we&#39;re all one fucking being on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:20.639" style="s2">planet right to treat us each other with</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.779" end="00:22:23.159" style="s2">anything other than compassion and love</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.639" end="00:22:24.509" style="s2">and respect is stupid as simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.159" end="00:22:25.769" style="s2">right you don&#39;t need religion to tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.509" end="00:22:27.299" style="s2">you that you don&#39;t need laws to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.769" end="00:22:30.179" style="s2">that we all know that it&#39;s self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.299" end="00:22:32.190" style="s2">right obvious we all know that so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.179" end="00:22:33.720" style="s2">act like that right let&#39;s be like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.190" end="00:22:38.370" style="s2">every single minute in this world let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.720" end="00:22:39.330" style="s2">be like that but forget government</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.370" end="00:22:41.159" style="s2">solutions you&#39;re not planning from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.330" end="00:22:43.080" style="s2">top down solutions are not coming that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.159" end="00:22:46.379" style="s2">way we have to find solution ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.080" end="00:22:49.049" style="s2">and make them irrelevant and obsolete so</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.379" end="00:22:51.119" style="s2">stop that ignore them do your own thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.049" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">make them irrelevant and obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.119" end="00:22:58.440" style="s2">let them fade away into nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:22:59.580" style="s2">where they belong that&#39;s all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.440" end="00:23:00.690" style="s2">interested is preserving their own power</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.580" end="00:23:02.879" style="s2">right so they are not going to provide</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.690" end="00:23:04.649" style="s2">solutions we the middle class in rich</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.879" end="00:23:06.119" style="s2">countries it is up to us to save the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.649" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">world no one else is going to do it I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.739" end="00:30:46.070" style="s2">the other Tommy one never really knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.299" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">cuz one wasn&#39;t there but according to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.070" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">what I&#39;ve read very very rarely actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:52.009" style="s2">real conflict is not any you look in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:53.899" style="s2">animal you use the animal kingdom before</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.009" end="00:30:56.029" style="s2">yeah what happens when two stags are</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.899" end="00:30:58.789" style="s2">facing off they swear at they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.029" end="00:31:00.139" style="s2">very very rare that two males when</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.789" end="00:31:01.730" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting for dollars actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.139" end="00:31:03.769" style="s2">fight yeah they put up a show and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.730" end="00:31:05.899" style="s2">snarl a may growl and they swag their</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.769" end="00:31:07.999" style="s2">asses or whatever but it&#39;s very rare</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.899" end="00:31:09.559" style="s2">they actually come into physical</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.999" end="00:31:11.989" style="s2">conflict one will usually back down</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.559" end="00:31:14.690" style="s2">janata me and so it&#39;s a show of strength</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.989" end="00:31:15.859" style="s2">rather than an actual battle and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.690" end="00:31:18.109" style="s2">usually ends there in the animal kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.859" end="00:31:22.730" style="s2">right there was a lot of trading between</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.109" end="00:31:24.380" style="s2">the tribals and if there really had an</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.730" end="00:31:25.490" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.380" end="00:31:27.470" style="s2">then they have to kill each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.490" end="00:31:29.990" style="s2">because there was no chord there was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.470" end="00:31:32.300" style="s2">word if I made it wasn&#39;t really training</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.990" end="00:31:33.650" style="s2">it was just a sharing of it you know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.300" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">know how to do this you know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.650" end="00:31:36.620" style="s2">that let&#39;s exchange ideas</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:38.600" style="s2">anybody wasn&#39;t like a trade it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.620" end="00:31:40.520" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s benefit acquire new</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.600" end="00:31:42.590" style="s2">skills and new knowledge and young</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.520" end="00:31:43.910" style="s2">tribes will amalgamate because they you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.590" end="00:31:46.130" style="s2">know they understood on some level that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.910" end="00:31:47.660" style="s2">this widened the gene pool as well right</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.130" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">and so this made them you know I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.660" end="00:31:52.130" style="s2">Brazilian how exactly exactly money is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">the money stuff we brought in so that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.130" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">could have a standing army before we did</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.990" end="00:31:57.650" style="s2">that the people that would be in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:31:59.510" style="s2">army would be the same people that grow</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.650" end="00:32:02.660" style="s2">the crops that do all the other work in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.510" end="00:32:04.220" style="s2">society so when the two armies met more</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.660" end="00:32:07.550" style="s2">often than not they had sent forward a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.220" end="00:32:10.430" style="s2">champion from each side the two people</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.550" end="00:32:12.050" style="s2">ever might call for solution and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.430" end="00:32:13.850" style="s2">decision would be made by those two</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.050" end="00:32:15.170" style="s2">people fighting and the two armies would</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.850" end="00:32:17.750" style="s2">go back to whatever it was they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.170" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">doing before right when we invented</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.750" end="00:32:23.540" style="s2">money we had the ability to have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">expandable and expendable force a group</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.540" end="00:32:27.230" style="s2">of people that were there</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">Julien truth simply to take life and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.230" end="00:32:30.980" style="s2">then the army that could just take life</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.380" style="s2">and it didn&#39;t matter how many you lose</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.980" end="00:32:35.780" style="s2">because you just buy some more could go</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.380" end="00:32:37.670" style="s2">up against a group that had to feed</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.780" end="00:32:40.490" style="s2">themselves had to hunt together had to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.670" end="00:32:42.140" style="s2">do all the other bits so decide that had</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.490" end="00:32:45.050" style="s2">the big armies that had nothing else to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.140" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">do could kill all of the others take</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.050" end="00:32:48.860" style="s2">over their space and enslaving life and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:51.500" style="s2">that&#39;s who now runs the world the people</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.860" end="00:32:54.900" style="s2">that have the big armies actually know</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.500" end="00:32:58.670" style="s2">like you want us to delete our</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.900" end="00:33:00.830" style="s2">promotions like we&#39;d like Kremers</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.830" end="00:33:06.990" style="s2">Hangzhou so don&#39;t get rid of greed just</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.410" end="00:33:10.410" style="s2">instead and spirit instead of focusing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.990" end="00:33:13.800" style="s2">your greed to in here I&#39;m greedy for</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.810" end="00:33:29.100" style="s2">in our stomach we need to lift it to our</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">heart and give instead of being greedy</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.100" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">to take that&#39;s always actually the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">thing you just doing the other way</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:41.910" style="s2">various I mean that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.170" end="00:33:44.100" style="s2">basically that&#39;s it I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.910" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">the questions before when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.100" end="00:33:49.800" style="s2">about what should we do instead of money</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:51.690" style="s2">and how do we actually get motivation to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.800" end="00:33:53.790" style="s2">build like if you want to build a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.690" end="00:33:57.780" style="s2">factory why do you want to build that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.790" end="00:34:00.930" style="s2">factory if the exact factory is for your</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.780" end="00:34:03.330" style="s2">own gain people will have to have money</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.930" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">to be able to build it for you but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.330" end="00:34:08.100" style="s2">a but everybody if that if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">going to build a factory or perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.100" end="00:34:13.260" style="s2">hospital that we gain that other people</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:15.390" style="s2">will gain from that we probably may be</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.260" end="00:34:18.380" style="s2">here it&#39;ll help progress because that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.390" end="00:34:18.380" style="s2">will be the inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.669" end="00:34:23.500" style="s2">and I&#39;m real sorry different incentives</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.399" end="00:34:25.899" style="s2">will arise you know what I mean you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.500" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">gain status for different reasons I see</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.899" end="00:34:31.059" style="s2">you know yeah I&#39;m joined in halfway</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:32.740" style="s2">through yeah so nice to get bits and</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.490" end="00:34:43.179" style="s2">right well no I think it succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.260" end="00:34:45.159" style="s2">beautifully more designs give to enslave</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.179" end="00:34:49.809" style="s2">a population yeah it succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.159" end="00:34:52.000" style="s2">fantastically well well apparently not</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.809" end="00:34:54.519" style="s2">actually the first of all through money</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.839" end="00:35:02.799" style="s2">each other we did the bartering thing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:04.779" style="s2">be able to trade with other tribes which</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.799" end="00:35:08.589" style="s2">obviously caused more problems</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.329" end="00:37:56.630" style="s2">Universal I think it I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.799" end="00:37:58.549" style="s2">excellent idea for a transitional step</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.630" end="00:38:00.470" style="s2">remove people in slavery right take the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.549" end="00:38:02.599" style="s2">class slavery immediately and I think I</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:12.260" style="s2">controller I mean they&#39;re doing some</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.670" end="00:38:13.640" style="s2">studies on right now there&#39;s there&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.260" end="00:38:15.109" style="s2">kit there&#39;s two schools of thought on</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.640" end="00:38:17.089" style="s2">this and until you try it you never</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.109" end="00:38:18.589" style="s2">really know one school of thought is but</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.089" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">if you just give people the means to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.589" end="00:38:21.260" style="s2">live they don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:22.940" style="s2">exchange so just sit around stroking</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.260" end="00:38:25.460" style="s2">their penises all day long you know they</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.940" end="00:38:28.609" style="s2">but I like one thing on that they can</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.460" end="00:38:32.059" style="s2">control their mouth of it so it would</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.609" end="00:38:34.069" style="s2">just be it&#39;s a basic income right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.059" end="00:38:35.900" style="s2">basic income it provides you the basic</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.069" end="00:38:38.270" style="s2">you think like it&#39;s at all not a luxury</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.900" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">lifestyle right now later I face so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.270" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">don&#39;t have to work to get food and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:44.089" style="s2">shelter and heating you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:45.380" style="s2">but you are still free to work and go</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.750" end="00:38:50.990" style="s2">benefit that you knew when you start</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.099" end="00:38:52.819" style="s2">earning it&#39;s everybody gets it over</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.990" end="00:38:56.030" style="s2">ritual for you are everybody gets at</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.819" end="00:38:57.589" style="s2">universal basic income right the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.030" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">school of thought is that if you free</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.589" end="00:39:01.400" style="s2">people from having to go to shit jobs</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:02.809" style="s2">every day if you know four six pounds an</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.809" end="00:39:06.920" style="s2">50-hour weeks just to pay the red if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.490" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">free people and then they will start</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.920" end="00:39:10.130" style="s2">just doing other things they will stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:12.279" style="s2">coming up with other ways to occupy</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.130" end="00:39:16.069" style="s2">their time and they will start creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.279" end="00:39:18.109" style="s2">blogs music pictures you know inventions</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.069" end="00:39:20.390" style="s2">whatever and you know you now free</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.109" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">people up to follow things that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.390" end="00:39:24.559" style="s2">actually want to do a very wise man once</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">said if you have to pay money to someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.559" end="00:39:27.940" style="s2">to do something the job probably wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:32.660" style="s2">worth doing in</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.940" end="00:39:35.240" style="s2">so yeah I think and they try it right</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.660" end="00:39:36.710" style="s2">now yeah they&#39;re giant Finland they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.700" end="00:39:48.290" style="s2">please don&#39;t I mean that&#39;s even worse of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.369" end="00:39:54.710" style="s2">money as a control mechanism for society</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.290" end="00:39:57.640" style="s2">so money is a cool right I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.710" end="00:39:57.640" style="s2">you come from money</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.040" end="00:40:03.900" style="s2">you know money to some extent no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.980" end="00:40:05.790" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a question really is if it</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.900" end="00:40:10.740" style="s2">is how is this not play a big talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.790" end="00:40:13.290" style="s2">because interest on make right and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.740" end="00:40:18.420" style="s2">only benefits the rich I agree to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.290" end="00:40:19.960" style="s2">to an extent in Islam how does your</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.420" end="00:40:21.700" style="s2">claim</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.420" end="00:40:37.330" style="s2">hundreds of years and promote financing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.510" end="00:40:39.430" style="s2">and trade you&#39;re trying to see as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.330" end="00:40:41.770" style="s2">transition as a transitional step but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.430" end="00:40:43.450" style="s2">really do believe long term we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.770" end="00:40:45.310" style="s2">get away from the whole thing of money</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.450" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">and profit altogether and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.310" end="00:40:48.820" style="s2">learn how to just just collaborate you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">know the means you help each other out</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.820" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">to the Islamic music financing in three</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:59.260" style="s2">how do you ban where you&#39;ve an interest</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:41:01.150" style="s2">and uses yeah as a as a first step as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.260" end="00:41:03.370" style="s2">first step banning interest banning debt</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.150" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">based money burning usury and debt based</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.370" end="00:41:07.540" style="s2">money I think I&#39;ll be dealing I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:10.530" style="s2">I&#39;d be an excellent yeah I bet but again</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.540" end="00:41:13.060" style="s2">I would stress again with long term</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.530" end="00:41:14.590" style="s2">that&#39;s just a transitional step in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.060" end="00:41:17.170" style="s2">long term goal getting away from money</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.590" end="00:41:20.110" style="s2">altogether yeah I really really believe</p>
