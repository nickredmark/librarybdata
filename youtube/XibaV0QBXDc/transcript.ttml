<p begin="00:00:25.360" end="00:00:30.789" style="s2">so we have the global ecological crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.300" end="00:00:34.989" style="s2">we have massive inequality and poverty</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.789" end="00:00:38.409" style="s2">we have rigged financial systems there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:03.729" style="s2">more than 15 years on a number of</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.729" end="00:01:08.230" style="s2">resume to bring together all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.460" end="00:01:10.660" style="s2">different Sciences that study cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.230" end="00:01:13.300" style="s2">change and bring them under under one</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.660" end="00:01:16.030" style="s2">umbrella and I&#39;m calling this work</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.300" end="00:01:18.430" style="s2">culture design so the design of culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.030" end="00:01:21.190" style="s2">is seeking to intentionally change the</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.190" end="00:01:27.340" style="s2">with the convergence of systemic crises</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.250" end="00:01:30.160" style="s2">in the world the human civilization that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.340" end="00:01:32.440" style="s2">we are living in is to put it mildly</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.160" end="00:01:35.020" style="s2">it&#39;s at jeopardy our prospects for</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.440" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">making it through the resource scarcity</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.170" end="00:01:48.070" style="s2">of those things quickly enough and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:50.230" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a thriving complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.070" end="00:01:52.690" style="s2">civilization and a hundred years from</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.230" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">now we will only get there if we do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.690" end="00:01:58.090" style="s2">by design so basically here&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">specific thing that I&#39;m proposing to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.090" end="00:02:04.570" style="s2">I want to create a Research Center</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:06.940" style="s2">affiliated with a university that begins</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.570" end="00:02:09.639" style="s2">to bring together the different fields</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.639" end="00:02:14.900" style="s2">three key areas are</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.530" end="00:02:17.720" style="s2">complexity science so this is the study</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.900" end="00:02:20.269" style="s2">of nonlinear adaptive systems phase</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.720" end="00:02:22.909" style="s2">transitions emergent phenomenon network</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.269" end="00:02:24.530" style="s2">science a host of related things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.909" end="00:02:26.950" style="s2">what you would see done at the work of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.530" end="00:02:30.739" style="s2">the Santa Fe Institute the second one is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.950" end="00:02:33.049" style="s2">cognitive cognitive science and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.739" end="00:02:34.370" style="s2">evolution together which is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.049" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">the way that the human mind works</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.370" end="00:02:38.870" style="s2">through the lenses of psychology</p>

<p begin="00:02:38.870" end="00:02:43.459" style="s2">science and other related areas and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.489" end="00:02:45.260" style="s2">cultural evolution looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.459" end="00:02:48.470" style="s2">evolutionary history of human social</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.260" end="00:02:49.940" style="s2">nature the group dynamics of humans how</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:51.470" style="s2">that applies to organizational</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.940" end="00:02:54.019" style="s2">development to marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.470" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">communications to storytelling to whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.019" end="00:02:59.620" style="s2">host of areas so and these are the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:01.849" style="s2">two so the third one is global change</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.620" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">global change being really an earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.849" end="00:03:06.680" style="s2">system science perspective looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:09.620" style="s2">how climate is changing how the global</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.680" end="00:03:11.810" style="s2">biosphere is changing how the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.620" end="00:03:13.160" style="s2">of human systems is changing so these</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.810" end="00:03:15.319" style="s2">are all areas where a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.160" end="00:03:17.450" style="s2">research is done in a reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.319" end="00:03:19.609" style="s2">disciplinary manner at the present</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.450" end="00:03:21.349" style="s2">moment there are actually hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.609" end="00:03:23.660" style="s2">research fields looking at different</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.349" end="00:03:26.060" style="s2">pieces of this problem but none of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.660" end="00:03:27.590" style="s2">are focused specifically on bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.060" end="00:03:30.049" style="s2">together all of the pieces that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.590" end="00:03:31.700" style="s2">necessary to guide civilization through</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.700" end="00:03:36.829" style="s2">this is a global research capability</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:38.630" style="s2">that is needed to both study the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.829" end="00:03:40.519" style="s2">patterns of culture and how those</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.630" end="00:03:42.829" style="s2">patterns of culture are rising and other</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.519" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">changing and also to guide them through</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.829" end="00:03:49.069" style="s2">effective policy tools and those policy</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:50.599" style="s2">tools can be governmental like taxation</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.069" end="00:03:52.040" style="s2">and regulation and those sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.599" end="00:03:54.200" style="s2">that are familiar but they also can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.040" end="00:03:55.879" style="s2">in terms of decision-making structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.200" end="00:03:58.190" style="s2">which gets into the world of social</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.190" end="00:04:03.019" style="s2">models disruptive social technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:05.209" style="s2">which could be computer technology or</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.799" end="00:04:15.319" style="s2">but as i said earlier in this all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">this knowledge in the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.319" end="00:04:19.459" style="s2">different fields looking at this problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:21.169" style="s2">are disparate from each other the</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.169" end="00:04:24.540" style="s2">came in business government and academia</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.659" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">are all</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.540" end="00:04:29.850" style="s2">siloed and separate from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a great need for synthesis so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.850" end="00:04:34.170" style="s2">I win this if you award me this</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:36.420" style="s2">fellowship what i will do is convene a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.170" end="00:04:39.180" style="s2">conference you can think of it as like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.420" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">three-day workshop of the leading</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.180" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">scholars and practitioners in the field</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:45.390" style="s2">of culture design to map out the</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">begin to build an institutional capacity</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">for researching things like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">achieve peace in a world that is</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.140" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">I&#39;m setting out to do and I&#39;ve already</p>
