<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:09.749" style="s2">you had a really interesting wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.189" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">conversation with jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.749" end="00:00:14.999" style="s2">earlier this year and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:16.289" style="s2">like the read the comments and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.999" end="00:00:18.060" style="s2">people thought it was one of his best</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.289" end="00:00:20.610" style="s2">conversations seem that you really</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">sparked off each other and yes i enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.610" end="00:00:24.540" style="s2">it yeah yeah can you talk more about</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">that he came from the now-famous</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.540" end="00:00:30.030" style="s2">interview with Kathy Newman on channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">so he was quite you know wired he</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.030" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">arrived extremely late and he had half</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:37.409" style="s2">an hour between them and getting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">Paris we had had we&#39;d never met one</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.409" end="00:00:41.519" style="s2">another and I knew actually very little</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:45.179" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson has written work</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.519" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">he knew pretty little about mine and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.179" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">were just told sit down and shoot and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">had no idea where we were going so he</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:53.819" style="s2">just started talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:56.159" style="s2">so why the maestro&#39;s emissary and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.819" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">just went from there but what I felt was</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.159" end="00:01:03.389" style="s2">here was you know a super intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:05.489" style="s2">man who had wide-ranging interests in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.389" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">psychology philosophy and didn&#39;t rule</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:11.160" style="s2">out a spiritual angle to things and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">don&#39;t think that I would and in the film</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.160" end="00:01:15.300" style="s2">I in that clip I think he probably comes</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">out that there are aspects of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.300" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">Jordan was saying that I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">well yes but so I didn&#39;t entirely kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">of not a Peter Peter Sohn Ian but I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">have a huge respect for him and we had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:33.480" style="s2">great conversation and we were proposing</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">to do more yeah I mean one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.480" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">common comments was where&#39;s the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">this interview well actually I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:45.120" style="s2">he&#39;s been fabulously busy in the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:47.010" style="s2">year and I had to email him about</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.120" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">something else actually just yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.010" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">and he wrote back saying and top of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:54.870" style="s2">list for when I begin again doing a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:56.970" style="s2">podcast in the new year is to do one</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.870" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">with you listening to it that was very</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.970" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">interesting especially as you hadn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">weren&#39;t that aware of each other&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">how it seemed that your theories mapped</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:06.480" style="s2">onto something he talks about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:09.210" style="s2">which is the balance of ordering chaos</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.480" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">and the known versus the unknown is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.210" end="00:02:16.439" style="s2">a right-brain left-brain for</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:16.950" style="s2">no is there a parallel not much there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.439" end="00:02:22.019" style="s2">a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.950" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">I mean Festival I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.019" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">his order is mail than chaos is female I</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">don&#39;t even understand that and I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:37.409" style="s2">accept that the left hemisphere which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">nor what he&#39;s talking about is concerned</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.409" end="00:02:46.519" style="s2">above all with consistency so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:49.799" style="s2">why it over relies on systems procedures</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.519" end="00:02:51.540" style="s2">algorithms that produce results are</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.799" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">consistent with everything else it knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.540" end="00:02:56.909" style="s2">the right hemisphere is open to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:02:58.859" style="s2">everything as you were without prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.909" end="00:03:01.379" style="s2">and it therefore sees that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.859" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">many things that actually don&#39;t then do</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.379" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">that now in the left hemisphere those</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">just get ruled out and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">where we wraps intellectually we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">system that is self-consistent a cake</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">flan getting rolled out and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:15.260" style="s2">can&#39;t see well not everybody but many</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:18.599" style="s2">people cannot see a way out of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:22.109" style="s2">because because actually once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.599" end="00:03:24.359" style="s2">inside this hall of mirrors as I call it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.109" end="00:03:26.609" style="s2">you can&#39;t see the chinks where you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">sort of get out what I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.609" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">Peterson is doing is he has enormous</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.030" end="00:03:38.729" style="s2">rhetorical strength and he&#39;s really you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:40.439" style="s2">know allowing people to to see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.729" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">there are things that is not that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.439" end="00:03:46.370" style="s2">not included this model and I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:51.150" style="s2">that I enter perhaps in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.370" end="00:03:53.220" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the same thing if you like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.150" end="00:03:57.079" style="s2">did say to him you&#39;ve seemed very keen</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.220" end="00:03:59.939" style="s2">on order which might exclude chaos but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.079" end="00:04:03.139" style="s2">chaos is like the sort of grit in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.939" end="00:04:07.530" style="s2">oyster shell there is a need for this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.139" end="00:04:09.409" style="s2">resistance this is a theme that is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.530" end="00:04:11.729" style="s2">important in the book I&#39;m now writing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.409" end="00:04:16.199" style="s2">which is that nothing comes into being</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.729" end="00:04:18.509" style="s2">or can be without resistance and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.199" end="00:04:21.599" style="s2">simple way of thinking about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.509" end="00:04:23.250" style="s2">actually we can&#39;t move if it were not</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.599" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">for friction friction is actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.250" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">stopping you moving actually moving</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">dependence on friction a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">sophisticated one is to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:43.830" style="s2">nature of flow which is the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:47.220" style="s2">merciful&#39; of flow as what it is what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.830" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">universe is you know Heraclitus is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.220" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">saying everything flows this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:51.150" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">you didn&#39;t say everything changes he</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.150" end="00:04:57.380" style="s2">said everything flows which is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:05:01.490" style="s2">different matter but anyway flow</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.380" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">produces something very important it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.490" end="00:05:06.570" style="s2">produces irregularities and it only</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:09.780" style="s2">actually exists if there is a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.570" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">containment so if water if if there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:15.510" style="s2">no containment water is still and does</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.570" end="00:05:18.120" style="s2">nothing it&#39;s the containment that causes</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.510" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">the flow and it&#39;s obstructions to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.120" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">flow that caused turbulence and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:26.450" style="s2">turbulence is massively created or flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.910" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">in nature is turbulent or at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.450" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">almost all that flowing in nature is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:35.720" style="s2">turbulent and turbulence is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:38.850" style="s2">last things that we can map we know how</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.720" end="00:05:40.500" style="s2">we we&#39;re getting to grip we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.850" end="00:05:43.530" style="s2">know but we&#39;re getting to grips better</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.500" end="00:05:46.050" style="s2">with quantum mechanics than we are with</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.530" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">the the mathematical equations for flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.050" end="00:05:50.760" style="s2">they&#39;re so complex and this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:52.650" style="s2">almost infinitely complex that it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.760" end="00:05:54.930" style="s2">said that we can never actually do it so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.650" end="00:05:58.380" style="s2">they might be an instance of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.930" end="00:05:59.940" style="s2">chaos that is vastly created partly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.380" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">because it&#39;s the coming together of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.940" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">order with disorder and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:08.460" style="s2">saying we need division and we need</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:10.260" style="s2">Union it&#39;s not just that union is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.460" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">marvelous all as one and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.260" end="00:06:14.910" style="s2">perfectly why&#39;s point of view it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.690" end="00:06:17.550" style="s2">that everything is separate and distinct</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.910" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">and atomistic we need to bring these two</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.550" end="00:06:21.030" style="s2">apparently opposite points of view</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:23.669" style="s2">together we need Union and division but</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:25.350" style="s2">we need at a meta level the union of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.669" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">them not the division of them which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.350" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">what we now have so that is imaged in</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">this business of water and let me just</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:36.229" style="s2">give you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">something that might strike viewers if</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.229" end="00:06:43.939" style="s2">you take an entirely straight sided pipe</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">and you put waters run water through it</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.939" end="00:06:49.939" style="s2">at such a speed that it can run smoothly</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:51.889" style="s2">and you then place at right angles</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.939" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">perpendicular to the flow an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.889" end="00:06:57.949" style="s2">straight metal bar that doesn&#39;t block</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:07:01.400" style="s2">the flow what you get what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.949" end="00:07:04.490" style="s2">you get you get something imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.400" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">that is both orderly and beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.490" end="00:07:10.279" style="s2">nothing like the rector linearity of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:14.169" style="s2">you get something called Carmen Street</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.279" end="00:07:17.539" style="s2">vortex which is a series of interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.169" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">flows that have clear structure that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.539" end="00:07:26.199" style="s2">also unwrapped Abul and and endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:30.110" style="s2">variable so out of this unpromising</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.199" end="00:07:34.399" style="s2">conjunction a rectilinear unitary things</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:37.210" style="s2">comes this multifarious creative beauty</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.399" end="00:07:40.039" style="s2">that is I think it a lovely image for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.210" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">so I remember in the interview you asked</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.039" end="00:07:43.669" style="s2">you asked that question about that he</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:46.189" style="s2">was a little bit more suspicious of Kaos</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.669" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">than the newer and his answer was that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.189" end="00:07:49.999" style="s2">he thought it was right to put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">on the right border between order and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.999" end="00:07:54.199" style="s2">chaos yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:56.120" style="s2">which is where we came together yes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.199" end="00:07:59.719" style="s2">he acknowledged that there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.120" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">this this coming together of order and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.719" end="00:08:02.779" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:04.399" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think we&#39;re apart on this it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.779" end="00:08:08.180" style="s2">was just the difference of emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.399" end="00:08:09.800" style="s2">because whatever else it seemed from</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.180" end="00:08:12.589" style="s2">what he&#39;d just been saying in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.800" end="00:08:14.449" style="s2">conversation that he I mean after all</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.589" end="00:08:17.839" style="s2">famously he said get your room in order</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.449" end="00:08:20.209" style="s2">which I&#39;m in favor of I&#39;m also in favor</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.839" end="00:08:23.539" style="s2">of a slight element of disorder in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.209" end="00:08:26.959" style="s2">order and indeed the the art of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.539" end="00:08:29.589" style="s2">is a uniting water with disorder pattern</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.959" end="00:08:32.269" style="s2">with things that can&#39;t be mapped and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.589" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">what do you make of the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.269" end="00:08:36.500" style="s2">criticisms cuz often he&#39;s described as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:38.120" style="s2">fraud or a charlatan in some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.500" end="00:08:39.380" style="s2">media coverage but when you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.120" end="00:08:41.300" style="s2">interview with yourself I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.380" end="00:08:42.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a very high level conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.300" end="00:08:44.620" style="s2">the idea of him as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.310" end="00:08:46.900" style="s2">a charlatan just seems kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.620" end="00:08:51.580" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.900" end="00:08:54.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s disrespectful its dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.580" end="00:08:58.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s entirely typical of blinkered</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.760" end="00:09:00.310" style="s2">liberalism he you can disagree with him</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.270" end="00:09:04.089" style="s2">about many things and I would disagree</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.310" end="00:09:06.730" style="s2">with him about a number of things but to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.089" end="00:09:10.330" style="s2">say that is just to show how pink and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.730" end="00:09:18.940" style="s2">you are he&#39;s clearly an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.330" end="00:09:21.100" style="s2">man and I mean I think what strikes</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.940" end="00:09:23.830" style="s2">people is that he was relatively unknown</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.100" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">and then he became known but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.830" end="00:09:29.110" style="s2">life isn&#39;t it disapproval Rochelle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:30.820" style="s2">yeah maybe some jealousy but I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.110" end="00:09:33.250" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting for me is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.820" end="00:09:35.890" style="s2">I went out to interview him in October</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.250" end="00:09:37.960" style="s2">last year and as soon as yeah before</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.890" end="00:09:40.870" style="s2">well before the Kathy Newman interview</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.960" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">yeah and my immediate as soon as I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.870" end="00:09:45.460" style="s2">couple of his lectures I thought this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:47.050" style="s2">of this is the important piece that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.460" end="00:09:51.280" style="s2">we&#39;re missing in our culture right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.050" end="00:09:53.500" style="s2">so none of like his his his meteoric</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.280" end="00:09:55.300" style="s2">success since then has been no surprise</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.500" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">to me because I thought it&#39;s not to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.300" end="00:10:01.480" style="s2">and also I find it very interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:02.620" style="s2">in this very new atheist kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.480" end="00:10:04.180" style="s2">dominated world</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.620" end="00:10:05.650" style="s2">yeah something we have a man talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.180" end="00:10:07.480" style="s2">about religious experience and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.650" end="00:10:08.790" style="s2">experience one of the most famous</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.480" end="00:10:11.260" style="s2">academics in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.790" end="00:10:16.500" style="s2">how significant do you think that as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.260" end="00:10:21.460" style="s2">think it is very significant I myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.500" end="00:10:27.550" style="s2">probably prefer more you might call it</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.460" end="00:10:29.280" style="s2">mystical approach to religion then then</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.550" end="00:10:33.280" style="s2">Jordan and although I wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.280" end="00:10:35.730" style="s2">you know narrow down I don&#39;t know him</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.280" end="00:10:38.709" style="s2">and his views well enough to but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.730" end="00:10:41.520" style="s2">sensed that I the things that really</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.709" end="00:10:46.370" style="s2">interest me in the spiritual tradition</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.520" end="00:10:49.310" style="s2">Taoism Zen Sufism</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.370" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">the medieval mystics meister eckhart the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.310" end="00:10:57.110" style="s2">author of the Cloud of Unknowing you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.100" end="00:10:59.330" style="s2">know Jakob Irma Udo that score and these</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.110" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">people seem to me to be expressing very</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.330" end="00:11:04.730" style="s2">profound truths and indeed in that talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:07.670" style="s2">with Jordan I brought up the lurianic</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.730" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">kabbalah which is something I came to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.670" end="00:11:12.230" style="s2">only about four or five years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:15.890" style="s2">which is seems to me absolutely packed</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.230" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">with with the most vivid insights in</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.890" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">into the nature of things which which</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">illuminates um the the right left</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">hemisphere thing that I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:29.270" style="s2">about I just couldn&#39;t believe it that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:32.300" style="s2">there it was in 1600 and something</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.270" end="00:11:33.770" style="s2">people insures it this you see this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.300" end="00:11:36.590" style="s2">the thing I think people have an</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.770" end="00:11:38.930" style="s2">intuitive knowledge that them their mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.590" end="00:11:41.150" style="s2">is actually not unitary that there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.930" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">different aspects to it that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.150" end="00:11:47.030" style="s2">differently valid ways of thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:49.190" style="s2">that the culture forces you to response</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.030" end="00:11:52.460" style="s2">one point of view one of the values of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.190" end="00:11:55.280" style="s2">having a religious culture is that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.460" end="00:11:57.530" style="s2">allows you to espouse what first of all</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.280" end="00:12:00.500" style="s2">it instills humility which is no bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.530" end="00:12:02.390" style="s2">thing it seems to me simply a failure of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.500" end="00:12:04.520" style="s2">intellect to believe your intellect is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.390" end="00:12:10.520" style="s2">so powerful that it knows everything or</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.520" end="00:12:12.410" style="s2">even could and so no doubt in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.520" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">is an ongoing process we let I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.410" end="00:12:16.370" style="s2">mouse by thinking those everything but</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:17.990" style="s2">whatever it comes after us may look back</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.370" end="00:12:21.890" style="s2">on us and think with their poor little</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.990" end="00:12:24.550" style="s2">brains so the Harrigan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.890" end="00:12:26.870" style="s2">of we can understand it all is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.550" end="00:12:29.060" style="s2">breathtaking so one thing good thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.870" end="00:12:32.600" style="s2">about religion is it instills a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.060" end="00:12:36.500" style="s2">you know limits and humility which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.600" end="00:12:38.360" style="s2">think are very good it embodies</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.500" end="00:12:40.370" style="s2">I mean this is old old hat but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:42.620" style="s2">embodies certain kinds of moral</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.370" end="00:12:45.050" style="s2">principle which of course it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.620" end="00:12:46.790" style="s2">necessary to an atheist can be a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.050" end="00:12:48.680" style="s2">moral person but it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.790" end="00:12:50.750" style="s2">useful in the culture to have norms</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.680" end="00:12:54.500" style="s2">against which to judge things at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.750" end="00:12:57.320" style="s2">moment the norms those of me and what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.500" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">need and so on which are not so good is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.320" end="00:13:02.570" style="s2">we should simply trade it down you refer</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:04.550" style="s2">to it just then about the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.570" end="00:13:05.840" style="s2">the left brain as a Hall of Mirrors yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.550" end="00:13:08.450" style="s2">and I think this is in your RSA</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.840" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">animation as well the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.450" end="00:13:11.810" style="s2">things I think I paraphrase but</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">something like the things that might</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.810" end="00:13:17.240" style="s2">lead us out yeah are immediately seized</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:19.820" style="s2">upon I think what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.240" end="00:13:22.250" style="s2">is any kind of experience beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.820" end="00:13:24.760" style="s2">left brain is immediately seized upon by</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.250" end="00:13:26.810" style="s2">the left brain and brought back into</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.760" end="00:13:29.090" style="s2">could could you describe that because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.810" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">also sounds a lot like the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.090" end="00:13:33.830" style="s2">post-modernism which is that it is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:35.810" style="s2">it takes the surface and strips out the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.830" end="00:13:37.580" style="s2">meaning and then you&#39;re back years even</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.810" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">the transcendental is then taken and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.580" end="00:13:48.070" style="s2">deconstructed and you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:51.250" style="s2">right and the there are good things in</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.070" end="00:13:54.010" style="s2">post-modernism but there are also</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.250" end="00:13:59.110" style="s2">problems with it when it claims that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.010" end="00:14:01.730" style="s2">because truth is complex evolving</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.110" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">difficult to pin down there is no truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.730" end="00:14:04.790" style="s2">I mean once we&#39;re in that realm you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:07.190" style="s2">you can&#39;t even have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.790" end="00:14:08.900" style="s2">because it depends on some kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.190" end="00:14:12.170" style="s2">truth I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.900" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">it so that&#39;s my problem with it although</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.170" end="00:14:16.730" style="s2">you know one of the things I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">with about Jordan does he dismisses the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.730" end="00:14:20.260" style="s2">whole thing of face model is where</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.810" end="00:18:54.010" style="s2">was very much in the rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">tradition but I left school believing</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.010" end="00:18:58.660" style="s2">certain things that since then I found</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.220" style="s2">arguments and sophisticated philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.660" end="00:19:01.930" style="s2">and evidence in science that they may</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.220" end="00:19:04.120" style="s2">well be true but I couldn&#39;t have known</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.930" end="00:19:06.190" style="s2">that at that stage and they were that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.120" end="00:19:08.500" style="s2">the parts are not the same as the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.190" end="00:19:10.390" style="s2">the sum of the parts simply is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.500" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">whatever you say the same as the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.390" end="00:19:14.170" style="s2">if you say well what is that what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:15.460" style="s2">this mystery thing that&#39;s been added in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.170" end="00:19:16.870" style="s2">but that&#39;s of course because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.460" end="00:19:19.390" style="s2">already starting from the wrong point of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.870" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">view so the fact of the relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.390" end="00:19:25.740" style="s2">parts for how the idea that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:29.050" style="s2">a responsive thing that experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.740" end="00:19:33.190" style="s2">responds to you and you respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.050" end="00:19:35.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not a one-way process you know many</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.190" end="00:19:38.100" style="s2">others of these things that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.080" end="00:19:40.810" style="s2">embodiment of ideas is as important as</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.100" end="00:19:43.210" style="s2">you know the context changes of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.810" end="00:19:44.670" style="s2">that making things implicit suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">changes it into something else</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.670" end="00:19:50.500" style="s2">so all those ideas I intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:52.660" style="s2">espoused and then I came across Taoism</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.500" end="00:19:55.060" style="s2">which says things like the Dow that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.660" end="00:19:57.490" style="s2">be named is not in fact that&#39;s the start</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.060" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">of the data chain the the Dow that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.490" end="00:20:02.140" style="s2">be named is not the real Dow which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:04.090" style="s2">how exactly what I had been in queue</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.140" end="00:20:05.890" style="s2">thing that once you&#39;ve pinned it down</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.090" end="00:20:08.740" style="s2">and named it there&#39;s no longer the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.890" end="00:20:11.190" style="s2">thing and actually that is also there in</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.740" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">the Christian tradition for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.190" end="00:20:17.350" style="s2">central Gaston said if you understand it</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.350" end="00:20:22.810" style="s2">spoke to me but also what spoke to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.290" end="00:20:25.960" style="s2">was this idea of flow and movement which</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.810" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">I had come across because Eric lysis was</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.960" end="00:20:31.210" style="s2">legitimate in Heraclitus who I still</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:33.130" style="s2">think is probably the most important</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.130" end="00:20:38.560" style="s2">we only have fragments of what he</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.660" end="00:20:41.680" style="s2">thought but his thoughts are so resonant</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.560" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">and so penetrating that I keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.680" end="00:20:47.050" style="s2">back to them so the idea of flow of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.690" style="s2">that&#39;s in the watercourse way that&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.610" end="00:21:14.220" style="s2">good image for me of how we relate to</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.060" end="00:21:26.940" style="s2">they&#39;re measurable they are material but</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.080" end="00:21:29.330" style="s2">they are not separate from the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.940" end="00:21:31.980" style="s2">the water because they are the flow and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.330" end="00:21:34.230" style="s2">they also come out of it and go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.980" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">into it so there&#39;s no need to find a way</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:59.070" style="s2">interviews that we&#39;ve done have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.750" end="00:22:00.210" style="s2">about the idea that there are thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.070" end="00:22:01.500" style="s2">and there are perspectives that have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.210" end="00:22:04.020" style="s2">been left out of the sort of mainstream</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.390" end="00:22:14.100" style="s2">key thinkers that you think are really</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.730" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">essential for us to kind of reintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.100" end="00:22:28.340" style="s2">into our into our knowledge Western ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:28.340" style="s2">yes yes well what stands out for me is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:38.150" style="s2">William James and only their song the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.210" end="00:22:40.560" style="s2">beginning of the century of a song was</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.150" end="00:22:43.860" style="s2">the most famous philosopher in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.560" end="00:22:46.500" style="s2">and he&#39;s credited with causing the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.860" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">traffic jam on Broadway because so many</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.500" end="00:22:52.950" style="s2">people wanted to come in the a.m speak</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">and curiously he&#39;s been sidelined since</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.950" end="00:22:57.300" style="s2">about the thirties and forties he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:22:59.340" style="s2">recently rediscovered because he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.300" end="00:23:00.780" style="s2">things in the 1870s there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.340" end="00:23:04.920" style="s2">recently being confirmed</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.780" end="00:23:07.980" style="s2">by quantum mechanics and quantum field</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.920" end="00:23:10.020" style="s2">theory so that is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.980" end="00:23:13.980" style="s2">he understood the nature on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.020" end="00:23:16.290" style="s2">importance of time and motion which play</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.980" end="00:23:21.240" style="s2">a big part in the last part of the book</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.290" end="00:23:23.250" style="s2">I&#39;m currently working on and that might</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.240" end="00:23:25.830" style="s2">sound rather limited but actually what</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.250" end="00:23:29.340" style="s2">he shows you is that a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.830" end="00:23:33.080" style="s2">view of what we are what the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.340" end="00:23:35.580" style="s2">and how we relate to it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.080" end="00:23:38.220" style="s2">re-imagining in fact getting in touch</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.580" end="00:23:40.050" style="s2">once again with the reality of time and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.220" end="00:23:43.110" style="s2">the reality of motion I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.050" end="00:23:46.050" style="s2">things we the biggest mistakes we make</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.110" end="00:23:50.220" style="s2">is to say we&#39;ll react that time is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.050" end="00:23:53.550" style="s2">a real oriya fantasy it&#39;s just a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.220" end="00:23:55.920" style="s2">a delusion and actually when we break</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.550" end="00:23:59.010" style="s2">out of whatever it is aware now we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.920" end="00:24:00.750" style="s2">see that time is it&#39;s not existent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.010" end="00:24:05.040" style="s2">quite possible that in a world we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.750" end="00:24:07.230" style="s2">even conceive of course then things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.040" end="00:24:10.410" style="s2">we cannot conceive by definition might</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.230" end="00:24:12.630" style="s2">occur within the through everything we</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.410" end="00:24:17.490" style="s2">know about the cosmos time is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.630" end="00:24:18.990" style="s2">fundamental and cannot be just so and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.490" end="00:24:20.790" style="s2">may sound as I say a rather limited</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.990" end="00:24:23.880" style="s2">thing but in believe me Bell Tolls</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.790" end="00:24:27.390" style="s2">philosophy is extraordinarily redolent</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.880" end="00:24:30.780" style="s2">and I read a few years ago something</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.390" end="00:24:34.020" style="s2">called creative evolution revolucion</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.780" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">Claire trees which is translated now and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.020" end="00:24:39.030" style="s2">it is his introduction to metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:40.980" style="s2">and a series of other pieces which if</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.030" end="00:24:45.570" style="s2">people want to approach but some of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.980" end="00:24:49.380" style="s2">is the place to start and it&#39;s very rare</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.570" end="00:24:51.270" style="s2">for me now to read a book and be so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.380" end="00:24:53.460" style="s2">electrified that I can&#39;t put it down and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.270" end="00:24:56.910" style="s2">I&#39;m marking all the way down the page</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.460" end="00:24:59.460" style="s2">but with this I was so I think he is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.910" end="00:25:03.390" style="s2">very important I think William James is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.460" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">so central to much thought that has been</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.390" end="00:25:08.860" style="s2">left behind again from the same period</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:10.870" style="s2">before a kind of material upsetting in</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.860" end="00:25:13.660" style="s2">the interwar period there were many</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.870" end="00:25:17.290" style="s2">steps backwards you know we made huge</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.660" end="00:25:21.070" style="s2">steps forwards in biology very</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.290" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">sophisticated thinkers but between the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.070" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">wars a new mechanism came forth in</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:28.510" style="s2">biology when I started writing about</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:31.270" style="s2">science in this book I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.510" end="00:25:33.910" style="s2">physics and to a degree chemistry very</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.270" end="00:25:36.220" style="s2">much on my side in terms of a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.910" end="00:25:40.150" style="s2">of how things are it&#39;s not atomistic is</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.220" end="00:25:42.700" style="s2">not mechanical etc and then I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.150" end="00:25:45.310" style="s2">that actually this is being set down by</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.700" end="00:25:48.700" style="s2">biologists once again but the last time</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.310" end="00:25:51.910" style="s2">it was said was really up until the 30s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.700" end="00:25:55.690" style="s2">and 40s and then there was a dark age in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.910" end="00:25:57.370" style="s2">which everything was likened and and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.690" end="00:26:00.550" style="s2">were very excited by this wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:26:03.700" style="s2">discovery about DNA in the you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.550" end="00:26:06.100" style="s2">all like code in the computer and so on</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.700" end="00:26:08.860" style="s2">well I can&#39;t even begin we&#39;d have to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:13.290" style="s2">another talk about that because I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.860" end="00:26:16.420" style="s2">talk for now about why organisms are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.290" end="00:26:19.060" style="s2">mechanisms it is quite true that if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.420" end="00:26:20.680" style="s2">want to look at a tiny detail like</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.060" end="00:26:22.690" style="s2">what&#39;s going on on this side of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.680" end="00:26:24.700" style="s2">membrane and the other you can see a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.690" end="00:26:27.700" style="s2">kind of mechanism in other words a chain</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.700" end="00:26:29.170" style="s2">of causation but it simply doesn&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.700" end="00:26:31.870" style="s2">to the organism as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.170" end="00:26:33.940" style="s2">it cannot be native not because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.870" end="00:26:36.730" style="s2">know enough but intrinsically it is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.940" end="00:26:39.010" style="s2">the right way to think about it and if</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.730" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">you doubt that then I would that is one</p>
