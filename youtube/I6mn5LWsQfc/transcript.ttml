<p begin="00:00:03.330" end="00:00:08.970" style="s2">will you be editing or you just use it</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.060" end="00:00:11.309" style="s2">live yes just probably just use it as it</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.970" end="00:00:13.410" style="s2">is because I don&#39;t have to edit alright</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.309" end="00:00:18.570" style="s2">but what you were just saying I think</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">were actually making time to both of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">making time to have a opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">talk which is really nice on Easter</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:40.050" style="s2">Sunday probably a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">Easter Sunday for most people who even</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.050" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">care to celebrate Easter or have any</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:46.710" style="s2">relationship to Easter but it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">lot of families who for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.710" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">don&#39;t get to be with each other and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">even those ones that maybe the lucky</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:55.170" style="s2">ones they are the ones are worried about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">people in hospital or people taking care</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">of people in hospital so yeah strange</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">strange days wonderful to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">John it&#39;s been a while just leave it</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">parked um thank you for asking me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">great to be here and yeah we we just</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">before we started recording we have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">brief you were saying that in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">ecosystems restoration camp has also</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">been a strategy to prepare people for</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">the skills we need in crises to come and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">at the same time do what is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">do to ameliorate the crisis that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">already on the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">um and now we&#39;re kind of right in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">middle of a crisis that will just</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">increased and the need for such work and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">and I completely agree for me what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">interested in is is the way to scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">link what is effectively a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">small piece of land and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">people coming together to learn on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">peach piece of land how to restore it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">its wider community in its regional</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">context like the way that common land</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">works on landscape skate scales and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:11.790" style="s2">the ERC in Spain was was just a small</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">part of that and I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.790" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">scaling in structure I find that she</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:15.570" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:20.820" style="s2">interesting because that also bridges it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.570" end="00:02:23.670" style="s2">into how to provide for an entire small</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.820" end="00:02:27.620" style="s2">city in its region and how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.670" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">the way that as more and more years he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:33.720" style="s2">established themselves around the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">that they don&#39;t become like to the small</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.720" end="00:02:39.570" style="s2">anarchic training grounds but a real mix</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">of people really wanting to also engage</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.570" end="00:02:45.350" style="s2">with mainstream and help normal people</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">in learning how to restore ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.350" end="00:02:52.050" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s the real that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:55.980" style="s2">real goal so the the hardest part</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.050" end="00:03:00.410" style="s2">usually is to start and what we what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.980" end="00:03:03.990" style="s2">see now is that there are very large</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.410" end="00:03:06.170" style="s2">numbers of organizations and very large</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.990" end="00:03:09.740" style="s2">numbers of individuals around the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.170" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">who share the same intention</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.740" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">understanding that we need to have clean</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">drinking water we should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:25.860" style="s2">drink from the rivers really and we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:29.180" style="s2">to have fertile organic soils with</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.860" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">healthy microbiologic communities both</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:38.930" style="s2">bacterial and fungal communities that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:44.570" style="s2">have a important and and vital role in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.930" end="00:03:48.709" style="s2">creating life on Earth and so to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.570" end="00:03:51.510" style="s2">the earth without these healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.709" end="00:03:56.700" style="s2">microbiological communities is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.510" end="00:03:59.580" style="s2">ridiculous really and then we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.700" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">understand the role of the biomass the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.580" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">height of the canopy the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">organic materials changing the the soil</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:12.600" style="s2">temperatures the the the temperatures on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">the surface of the earth and what would</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.600" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">that does to affect the hydrological</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:22.080" style="s2">cycle the circulation of moisture the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:24.660" style="s2">natural regulation of the climate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.080" end="00:04:25.800" style="s2">then probably most important we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:29.340" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.800" end="00:04:34.349" style="s2">the relationships between all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.340" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">various species and the the primacy</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.349" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">really of biodiversity that this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:46.830" style="s2">really the expression of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">succession and it&#39;s critical for health</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.830" end="00:04:55.169" style="s2">and for balance in the earth so these</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:57.509" style="s2">these particular things are natural laws</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.169" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">they&#39;re not something that&#39;s at my</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.509" end="00:05:02.310" style="s2">opinion or anybody you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">matter what we think about it matters</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.310" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">that we understand these these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">because these are giving us an idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:17.009" style="s2">yeah they produce the air and the water</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:22.289" style="s2">in the soil so the the camps idea is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.009" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">to just restore a tiny place the camps</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.289" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">idea is I think you need to separate it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:31.530" style="s2">into infrastructure and mission you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:37.319" style="s2">so the the the infrastructure is a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.530" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">to allow people to do this work to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.319" end="00:05:44.849" style="s2">the knowledge that they need and we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:47.460" style="s2">also use this at a time like this where</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.849" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">we&#39;re in crisis I think in the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.460" end="00:05:53.810" style="s2">three weeks over 16 million people in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">the United States became unemployed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.810" end="00:06:00.979" style="s2">that&#39;s in addition to the vast numbers</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:04.949" style="s2">of homeless in and marginal people</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.979" end="00:06:07.949" style="s2">already so that&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.949" end="00:06:11.539" style="s2">increase by tens of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.949" end="00:06:11.539" style="s2">over the next couple of months</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.719" end="00:06:16.919" style="s2">I&#39;m completely aligned with you like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:17.969" style="s2">am and I think I think that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.919" end="00:06:20.370" style="s2">people that would listen to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.969" end="00:06:22.409" style="s2">completely understand that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.370" end="00:06:26.610" style="s2">great work of our time and you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.409" end="00:06:29.279" style="s2">letters and started a whole movement of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.610" end="00:06:32.039" style="s2">people wanting to do this work what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.279" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">saying is I&#39;ve been on this mission as</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.039" end="00:06:39.319" style="s2">well for the like 15 20 years and what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:42.469" style="s2">having worked with many of the pioneer</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.319" end="00:06:44.719" style="s2">villages that basically fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.469" end="00:06:46.189" style="s2">established eco village restoration</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.719" end="00:06:48.860" style="s2">comes with initiatives that have</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.189" end="00:06:52.490" style="s2">actually restored large landscape areas</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.860" end="00:06:54.139" style="s2">whether horrible or Tamera or fintan or</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.490" end="00:06:57.889" style="s2">they are the the projects that have</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.139" end="00:07:00.649" style="s2">grown out of fent on and and what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.889" end="00:07:02.149" style="s2">learned by being with these communities</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.649" end="00:07:07.669" style="s2">is that there comes a point that these</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.149" end="00:07:09.710" style="s2">projects also need to engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.669" end="00:07:12.169" style="s2">people who mean well but are stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.710" end="00:07:14.389" style="s2">public authorities of the local and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.169" end="00:07:17.180" style="s2">regional government the local mayor then</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.389" end="00:07:23.300" style="s2">the the local guy of the planning office</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.180" end="00:07:26.539" style="s2">and and somehow really embed this as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:29.689" style="s2">whole regional economic activity in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.539" end="00:07:32.539" style="s2">state well you know like yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.689" end="00:07:34.580" style="s2">what we see I think you you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.539" end="00:07:37.909" style="s2">know I take a slightly different tack</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.580" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">than you do because first of all I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.909" end="00:07:43.189" style="s2">that the ecosystem restoration camps and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:45.259" style="s2">eco villages have are symbiotic but</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.189" end="00:07:48.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.259" end="00:07:52.189" style="s2">ecosystem restoration camps are a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.519" end="00:07:54.979" style="s2">temporary step for a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.189" end="00:07:56.629" style="s2">when those people move on that a next</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.979" end="00:07:58.759" style="s2">group of people need to get the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.629" end="00:08:02.659" style="s2">information and when they have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.759" end="00:08:04.550" style="s2">ability to control water soil plants and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.659" end="00:08:07.099" style="s2">biodiversity and they have some</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.550" end="00:08:09.589" style="s2">experience in interpersonal relations</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.099" end="00:08:11.569" style="s2">and conflict resolution then they can go</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.589" end="00:08:14.779" style="s2">to ecosystem restoration camps they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.569" end="00:08:21.439" style="s2">be much better at making these types of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.779" end="00:08:23.449" style="s2">long-term societal changes work without</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.439" end="00:08:27.080" style="s2">those skills I think it will be very</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.449" end="00:08:30.379" style="s2">very hard and on the other side about</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.080" end="00:08:34.029" style="s2">economics I think that we have to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.379" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">at economics business as usual and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.029" end="00:08:40.069" style="s2">realize that we might not be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:42.139" style="s2">business as usual in the future that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.069" end="00:08:45.230" style="s2">may be looking at the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.139" end="00:08:48.980" style="s2">financial systems and the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.230" end="00:08:52.529" style="s2">currencies here so in that case we</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.980" end="00:08:55.410" style="s2">really need to figure out and live that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.529" end="00:08:58.199" style="s2">change we want to see on the earth so</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.410" end="00:09:01.379" style="s2">this we need to work with everybody then</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.199" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">otherwise yes it has to be a collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.379" end="00:09:06.449" style="s2">consciousness of humanity that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:09.059" style="s2">identifies the way forward it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.449" end="00:09:12.839" style="s2">about individuals deciding for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.059" end="00:09:15.720" style="s2">else what&#39;s going to happen and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.839" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">think what we have to have are profound</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.720" end="00:09:21.389" style="s2">and nuanced conversations where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:22.829" style="s2">discussing this and we can&#39;t just seek</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.389" end="00:09:25.889" style="s2">all the reasons why we&#39;re going to fail</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.829" end="00:09:28.529" style="s2">we need to seek the reasons why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.889" end="00:09:32.370" style="s2">going to succeed we need to seek and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.529" end="00:09:36.529" style="s2">like within this current crisis that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.370" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">see there&#39;s some really very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.529" end="00:09:43.559" style="s2">outcomes how many people are sitting</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">around with their families or just</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.559" end="00:09:48.329" style="s2">communicating with their families over</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">long distances but feeling from their</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.329" end="00:09:55.910" style="s2">heart how important it is to have family</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:59.430" style="s2">and friends and make a connection love</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.910" end="00:10:02.490" style="s2">communities and so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.430" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">different from the rat race you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.490" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">running around so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:10.259" style="s2">I&#39;ve been feeling lately is like you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:13.050" style="s2">succeed in the rat race but you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.259" end="00:10:17.730" style="s2">a rat you know if you do that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.050" end="00:10:19.740" style="s2">you might want to relax into trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.730" end="00:10:23.370" style="s2">figure out what it means to be a human</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.740" end="00:10:26.250" style="s2">being rather than then get on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.370" end="00:10:28.769" style="s2">treadmill and run around in a circle no</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.250" end="00:10:30.569" style="s2">but I completely utterly agree like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.769" end="00:10:32.699" style="s2">right now what&#39;s happening here I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.569" end="00:10:35.579" style="s2">yoga just to give you one example like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.699" end="00:10:37.980" style="s2">moved to Majorca because I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.579" end="00:10:40.889" style="s2">in the bioregional transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.980" end="00:10:43.170" style="s2">includes the activity that ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.889" end="00:10:45.529" style="s2">restoration camps would train people up</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.170" end="00:10:49.019" style="s2">to do which is large landscape</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.529" end="00:10:51.829" style="s2">restoration both to bring back forests</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.019" end="00:10:54.389" style="s2">and healthy rivers and also to grow</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.829" end="00:10:57.779" style="s2">healthier regenerative agriculture food</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.389" end="00:10:59.579" style="s2">and biomaterials all of that if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.779" end="00:11:01.410" style="s2">the reason I moved to my Orca is because</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.579" end="00:11:04.319" style="s2">Majorca has an island is a great example</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.410" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">of such a bioregional case study and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.319" end="00:11:07.620" style="s2">completely humble</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.769" style="s2">knowing that one person can&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.620" end="00:11:13.139" style="s2">that system but I wanted to see what by</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.769" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">making a commitment to one place I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.139" end="00:11:19.800" style="s2">do over 20 30 40 years building Network</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:23.730" style="s2">and nurturing a vision and a collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.800" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">activity and now because of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.730" end="00:11:26.970" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:28.949" style="s2">this isn&#39;t like what you said 16 million</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.970" end="00:11:30.750" style="s2">people got unemployed in the United</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.949" end="00:11:33.089" style="s2">States here there&#39;s barely a million</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.750" end="00:11:35.160" style="s2">people and more than half of them are</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.089" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">now unemployed because there is like 80</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.160" end="00:11:39.899" style="s2">percent is tourism industry yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:42.389" style="s2">there is no tourism anymore and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.899" end="00:11:45.540" style="s2">completely agree that what I would love</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.389" end="00:11:47.699" style="s2">to see for this island is to not for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.540" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">government to spend money so people can</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.699" end="00:11:55.250" style="s2">just mill around until maybe in 2021 or</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">2022 they recuperate some form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.250" end="00:11:59.879" style="s2">business in the tourism industry</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:03.509" style="s2">pretending they can go back to where</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.879" end="00:12:06.060" style="s2">they were I would love to see everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.509" end="00:12:07.620" style="s2">engaging in ecosystems restoration and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.060" end="00:12:11.910" style="s2">getting this it--like if he if the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.620" end="00:12:14.819" style="s2">government has to pay people a basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.910" end="00:12:17.699" style="s2">citizen income and and money anyway we</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.819" end="00:12:20.699" style="s2">might as well engage people with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.699" end="00:12:23.129" style="s2">land again and yes this kind of work so</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.699" end="00:12:27.059" style="s2">I&#39;m so with you I&#39;m just saying how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.129" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">we fit it into these realities of of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.059" end="00:12:31.350" style="s2">bio region like my yokomo I think you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:35.459" style="s2">you have to have a we have to we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.350" end="00:12:41.399" style="s2">reach calm we have to be all of us need</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.459" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">to become calm and to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.399" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">answers don&#39;t come intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">exactly they come from being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:56.129" style="s2">understand it and imagine it and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:59.459" style="s2">they come from sharing having a shared</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.129" end="00:13:02.250" style="s2">intention yeah I think so in order for</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.459" end="00:13:05.339" style="s2">people to grasp this there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.250" end="00:13:10.019" style="s2">deal of uncertainty there&#39;s a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.339" end="00:13:14.420" style="s2">of anxiety now so it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.019" end="00:13:17.960" style="s2">be calm in this situation it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.420" end="00:13:22.820" style="s2">important to be empathetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.960" end="00:13:24.830" style="s2">and compassionate now so seeking the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.820" end="00:13:27.320" style="s2">intellectual reasons I mean I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.830" end="00:13:30.380" style="s2">you my opinion I can tell you what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.320" end="00:13:32.990" style="s2">think but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.380" end="00:13:35.840" style="s2">be the determining factor for what</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:42.380" style="s2">happens I think that that might help to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.840" end="00:13:45.410" style="s2">inform what happens and so I&#39;m I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.380" end="00:13:48.530" style="s2">we are we have both a crisis we have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.410" end="00:13:52.130" style="s2">crisis and it&#39;s both serious risk and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.530" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">it&#39;s great opportunity now so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.130" end="00:13:57.830" style="s2">opportunity seems to be in the economic</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:14:03.160" style="s2">realm which you started to discuss I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.830" end="00:14:06.230" style="s2">think on the one hand we can offer this</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.160" end="00:14:10.420" style="s2">ecosystem restoration camps methodology</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.230" end="00:14:14.270" style="s2">as a way to put in central kitchens and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.420" end="00:14:17.690" style="s2">to have zero waste zero packaging zero</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.270" end="00:14:21.860" style="s2">pollution only organic only biodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.690" end="00:14:25.090" style="s2">only local only Fairtrade food and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.860" end="00:14:29.330" style="s2">can feed people this way now that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.090" end="00:14:33.020" style="s2">major benefit in a crisis like this so</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.330" end="00:14:34.390" style="s2">instead of having kind of sad tragic</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.020" end="00:14:38.660" style="s2">soup kitchens</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.390" end="00:14:42.350" style="s2">let&#39;s have joyous meals together in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.660" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">slow food movement that&#39;s not wasting</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.350" end="00:14:49.310" style="s2">food that&#39;s taking this food out of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:51.590" style="s2">transactional economic system and making</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.310" end="00:14:53.330" style="s2">it available to everybody so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.590" end="00:14:56.210" style="s2">going to be no waste there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.330" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">no packaging no pollution and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.210" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">going to be no hunger because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.750" style="s2">going to commit that the community eats</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:06.770" style="s2">everybody in this community eats now</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.750" end="00:15:14.110" style="s2">that&#39;s first second if we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.770" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">generate simple safe comfortable warm</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.110" end="00:15:23.350" style="s2">semi-nomadic housing options like</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.999" end="00:16:17.589" style="s2">the cost price and interest-bearing debt</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.799" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">which is essentially just this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.589" end="00:16:22.899" style="s2">corrupt non economy it&#39;s a type of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:26.499" style="s2">indentured servitude</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.899" end="00:16:29.230" style="s2">so that&#39;s bigger than the real economy</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.499" end="00:16:30.459" style="s2">of extraction manufacturing and buying</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.230" end="00:16:34.420" style="s2">and selling and then you have all this</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.459" end="00:16:37.689" style="s2">and all this other stuff so so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.420" end="00:16:40.059" style="s2">economy is failing and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.689" end="00:16:42.879" style="s2">recognize this that economy actually has</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.059" end="00:16:45.069" style="s2">failed long ago because it&#39;s devastated</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.879" end="00:16:47.589" style="s2">vast areas of the planet it&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.069" end="00:16:50.529" style="s2">billions of desperately poor people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.589" end="00:16:53.740" style="s2">super rich them so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.529" end="00:16:56.589" style="s2">failure so what are we going to do now I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.740" end="00:17:02.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we need to attack the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.589" end="00:17:04.510" style="s2">existing economy are the existing powers</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.110" end="00:17:07.000" style="s2">they need to take care of themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.510" end="00:17:10.899" style="s2">like you said if they&#39;re able to right</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.000" end="00:17:14.829" style="s2">the ship and don&#39;t sink it now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.899" end="00:17:18.130" style="s2">good that&#39;s good definitely that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.829" end="00:17:19.929" style="s2">more time to prepare but if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.130" end="00:17:23.169" style="s2">unable to right the ship then the ship&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.929" end="00:17:23.789" style="s2">going down now so what are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.169" end="00:17:26.589" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.789" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">ecosystem restoration camps with central</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.589" end="00:17:31.740" style="s2">kitchens and the ability to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:35.230" style="s2">people at this time would be critical</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.740" end="00:17:37.809" style="s2">are is critical and if we can apply this</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.230" end="00:17:39.250" style="s2">to the refugees and the migrants and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.809" end="00:17:42.860" style="s2">homeless and the post traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.250" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">disorder veterans even better so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.860" end="00:17:50.590" style="s2">the ideas which are within this are so</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:53.630" style="s2">important for the current situation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.590" end="00:17:55.640" style="s2">important for the restoration of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.630" end="00:17:58.519" style="s2">ecological systems for future</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.640" end="00:18:02.299" style="s2">generations so there are many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.519" end="00:18:04.850" style="s2">why this should happen but how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.299" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">that is not up to an individual to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.850" end="00:18:08.899" style="s2">well we&#39;re going to do it this way so</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.990" end="00:18:12.169" style="s2">John said we&#39;re gonna all go that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.899" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">the way it works the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.169" end="00:18:21.590" style="s2">leading are the organizations for</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:24.679" style="s2">instance via organic in Mexico or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.590" end="00:18:27.769" style="s2">the the group in India or the group in</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.679" end="00:18:31.700" style="s2">Somalia or the or the second community</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.769" end="00:18:35.090" style="s2">in Egypt and of course Finn Dorn Tamara</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.700" end="00:18:37.519" style="s2">and Ann are oval and Occidental Arts and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.090" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">ecology here in California all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.519" end="00:18:44.990" style="s2">have been working for decades and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:48.440" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing that we have to bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.990" end="00:18:50.990" style="s2">all this together into a mycelial</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:53.809" style="s2">Network where everything that&#39;s learned</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.990" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">immediately goes around the world so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.809" end="00:19:01.779" style="s2">we learn how to grow fungal inoculants</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:05.029" style="s2">that can massively increase fungal</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.779" end="00:19:06.649" style="s2">availability in soils then we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.029" end="00:19:09.440" style="s2">teach everybody how to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.649" end="00:19:11.389" style="s2">away and when we have these things in</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:14.389" style="s2">place and we&#39;re all dedicated to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.389" end="00:19:18.909" style="s2">and we&#39;re also we also have to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.389" end="00:19:22.070" style="s2">something else besides these I would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.909" end="00:19:25.909" style="s2">necessary things that we have to do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.070" end="00:19:28.909" style="s2">also have to slow down stop consuming so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.909" end="00:19:31.309" style="s2">much have no pollution and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.909" end="00:19:34.039" style="s2">have an interaction and where can we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.309" end="00:19:36.740" style="s2">that we can do that in ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.039" end="00:19:39.260" style="s2">restoration camps and when people go</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.740" end="00:19:42.590" style="s2">through ecosystem restoration camps they</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.260" end="00:19:45.010" style="s2">can all find out do I agree with this do</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.590" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2">I want to work with each other for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.010" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">the well-being of everyone that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.850" end="00:19:56.269" style="s2">you get the the change now I completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:20:00.049" style="s2">as I hear your vision and just see</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.269" end="00:20:02.509" style="s2">understand like i i&#39;ve been i dropped</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.049" end="00:20:04.909" style="s2">out or dropped in or whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.509" end="00:20:07.099" style="s2">to call it in in 1999 i moved to</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.759" end="00:20:29.349" style="s2">visiting a lot of these sites and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.269" end="00:20:33.459" style="s2">slept in years all of that they they I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.349" end="00:20:36.619" style="s2">completely see how all of that is such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.459" end="00:20:39.950" style="s2">amazing emergency response to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.619" end="00:20:42.129" style="s2">current crisis and the migrant crisis</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.950" end="00:20:46.719" style="s2">and there&#39;s huge potential for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.129" end="00:20:50.719" style="s2">there&#39;s also somehow this linking into</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.719" end="00:20:54.679" style="s2">how do we because we don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.719" end="00:20:57.049" style="s2">how quickly the dying system is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.679" end="00:20:59.089" style="s2">die and the midwifing is gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.049" end="00:21:04.459" style="s2">for the new system we wanted to birth</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.089" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">and so I feel that linking these</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.459" end="00:21:11.989" style="s2">initiatives with local government and in</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:16.099" style="s2">absolute commitment is just an it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.989" end="00:21:19.419" style="s2">a wider more scale linked approach where</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.099" end="00:21:23.149" style="s2">we this is a participatory project</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.419" end="00:21:26.359" style="s2">anyone who chooses to act and lead is</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.149" end="00:21:29.209" style="s2">the leader so you know all you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.359" end="00:21:31.129" style="s2">do is say oh I&#39;m I am part of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.209" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">ecosystem restoration camps movement I</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.129" end="00:21:35.839" style="s2">want it to go in this direction I want</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.669" style="s2">to go to the mayor or I want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.839" end="00:21:40.429" style="s2">the governor or I want to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.669" end="00:21:43.639" style="s2">president and I want to say look we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.429" end="00:21:47.059" style="s2">do this please do everyone has that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.639" end="00:21:49.609" style="s2">opportunity no one is is is says well</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.059" end="00:21:52.690" style="s2">don&#39;t do that or ask me what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.609" end="00:21:55.549" style="s2">this is happening around the world now</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.690" end="00:21:59.450" style="s2">so there are already camps in six</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.549" end="00:22:03.049" style="s2">different continents and as this emerges</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.450" end="00:22:06.769" style="s2">then they all have to make their way as</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.049" end="00:22:08.059" style="s2">though junk we had a conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.769" end="00:22:09.590" style="s2">think it was actually inside the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.059" end="00:22:12.980" style="s2">universal hall into</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.590" end="00:22:16.130" style="s2">was at 14 when you were basically going</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.980" end="00:22:20.570" style="s2">pregnant with this vision and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.130" end="00:22:26.029" style="s2">that was as nothing since I mean wow I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.570" end="00:22:30.140" style="s2">really amazing to see how sounding that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.029" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">note has just sort of moved into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.140" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">vacuum of people wanting to say I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:36.470" style="s2">don&#39;t I want to stop talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:39.230" style="s2">regeneration I want to do it and I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.470" end="00:22:42.440" style="s2">to do it with the land I love here and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.230" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">that&#39;s I and I mean I&#39;m like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.440" end="00:22:49.010" style="s2">know if you if you saw this I send it to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:52.429" style="s2">you a few weeks back a PDF of a friend</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.010" end="00:22:54.590" style="s2">of mine who here on Majorca and has</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.429" end="00:22:57.350" style="s2">started what it&#39;s called Bali Aerosmith</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.590" end="00:22:59.149" style="s2">and the idea is to basically start with</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.350" end="00:23:01.130" style="s2">every little pocket of land that a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.149" end="00:23:03.620" style="s2">private land owners willing to turn over</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.130" end="00:23:05.779" style="s2">to be turned into an agroforestry system</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.620" end="00:23:08.419" style="s2">and just here as we go along</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.779" end="00:23:11.870" style="s2">and in that process plant at least a</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.419" end="00:23:14.299" style="s2">million trees but not as just any type</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.870" end="00:23:17.210" style="s2">of trees but as agroforestry edible</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.299" end="00:23:21.649" style="s2">forest food and and and biomaterials</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:24.409" style="s2">production systems and and em but I also</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.649" end="00:23:26.899" style="s2">think by bringing in common land and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.409" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been I love the way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.899" end="00:23:31.940" style="s2">there is a sort of link in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:34.429" style="s2">genesis between common land and ERC&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.940" end="00:23:37.010" style="s2">because well common land speaks more to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.429" end="00:23:41.110" style="s2">conventional land owners larger land</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.010" end="00:23:42.830" style="s2">owners associations of of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.110" end="00:23:45.649" style="s2">agriculturalists that might even</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.830" end="00:23:47.240" style="s2">currently be more conventional I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.649" end="00:23:49.370" style="s2">that that&#39;s the pattern that I faced</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.240" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">here in Majorca and so for me that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.370" end="00:23:54.140" style="s2">really interesting strategy to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:56.299" style="s2">actually present to the locals this</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.140" end="00:23:58.669" style="s2">possibility of partnering with common</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.299" end="00:24:00.830" style="s2">land through existing associations of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.669" end="00:24:03.799" style="s2">land owners and then partnering with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.830" end="00:24:05.779" style="s2">few pockets to create little ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.799" end="00:24:08.450" style="s2">restoration camps and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.779" end="00:24:12.380" style="s2">perfectly serves this perfectly serves</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.450" end="00:24:16.429" style="s2">the movement so I would absolutely agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.380" end="00:24:19.309" style="s2">to this but this is not about so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.429" end="00:24:23.769" style="s2">able to decide what I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.309" end="00:24:26.149" style="s2">so you know I see the way forward as</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.769" end="00:24:29.779" style="s2">ecosystem restoration camps because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.149" end="00:24:32.899" style="s2">empowers the maximum number of people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.779" end="00:24:36.830" style="s2">participate and that has the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.899" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">impact and that I understand from my</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:44.419" style="s2">experiences and my observations that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:46.700" style="s2">everyone is equal so there are no there</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.419" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">is no real hierarchy because we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.700" end="00:24:51.230" style="s2">going to die</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:55.460" style="s2">maybe the co vid 19 is telling us this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.230" end="00:24:57.499" style="s2">to that that we&#39;re all equal and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.460" end="00:25:00.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve done in the past is we&#39;ve changed</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.499" end="00:25:03.889" style="s2">the world into this materialistic world</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.220" end="00:25:06.200" style="s2">where you pay for your rights and if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.889" end="00:25:09.139" style="s2">don&#39;t have any money to pay for your</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.200" end="00:25:12.619" style="s2">rights you don&#39;t have any rights this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.139" end="00:25:15.369" style="s2">not the way forward this is a recipe for</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.619" end="00:25:19.700" style="s2">tremendous suffering world war</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.369" end="00:25:24.619" style="s2">revolution it&#39;s going to be bad so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.700" end="00:25:28.419" style="s2">need to figure out how do you give back</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.619" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">the sovereignty and the dignity and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.419" end="00:25:38.509" style="s2">creativity and the the the energy the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:41.210" style="s2">the results so now we have a we talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.509" end="00:25:43.759" style="s2">about workers so workers are sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.210" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">their sofa watching TV if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.759" end="00:25:49.429" style="s2">working and art what are they working at</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">or how many people love what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.429" end="00:25:55.309" style="s2">doing and are working at something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:58.190" style="s2">they are their hearts and entire being</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.309" end="00:26:00.529" style="s2">is is satisfied by what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.190" end="00:26:04.399" style="s2">many people are just trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.529" end="00:26:06.529" style="s2">paycheck to survive and so what are they</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.399" end="00:26:08.919" style="s2">doing sometimes they&#39;re making plastic</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.529" end="00:26:11.029" style="s2">googas sometimes they&#39;re doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.919" end="00:26:14.059" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s of great</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.029" end="00:26:17.269" style="s2">importance just to get this money what</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.059" end="00:26:19.879" style="s2">we need is for everyone&#39;s work to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.269" end="00:26:22.850" style="s2">meaningful to do something that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.879" end="00:26:25.399" style="s2">something to do with life that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.850" end="00:26:28.610" style="s2">something to do where they&#39;re satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.399" end="00:26:31.610" style="s2">the intellectually spiritually satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.610" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">that they&#39;re doing what&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.610" end="00:26:39.590" style="s2">this has not yet emerged we need to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:41.900" style="s2">realize this so this is another way when</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.590" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">I see the ecosystem restoration camps as</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.900" end="00:26:47.960" style="s2">being is is this place to experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:52.150" style="s2">if you&#39;re using if you&#39;re using for</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.960" end="00:26:55.309" style="s2">instance common land or other other</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.150" end="00:26:58.520" style="s2">methodologies that&#39;s great but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.309" end="00:27:00.860" style="s2">choice is common land so common land</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.520" end="00:27:02.179" style="s2">must say oh we love ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.860" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">restoration camps and that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.179" end="00:27:05.809" style="s2">going to support here and at the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:09.470" style="s2">side we&#39;re going to continue to do what</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.809" end="00:27:11.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing so right now the large</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.470" end="00:27:18.380" style="s2">scale things which are invested are</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.780" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">threatened by by the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.380" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">system so now you need the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:27.370" style="s2">restoration camps even more and we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">to find the alternatives I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.370" end="00:27:33.320" style="s2">recommend for instance that real</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:35.000" style="s2">question is what is money now we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.320" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">that the money is coming to us from</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:40.610" style="s2">these capital formations which have been</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:43.130" style="s2">developed over historical time and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.610" end="00:27:46.730" style="s2">can talk about that if you want to but</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.130" end="00:27:49.610" style="s2">the fact of the matter is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.730" end="00:27:51.799" style="s2">another type of value that has been zero</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.610" end="00:27:52.460" style="s2">in the existing economy well that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.799" end="00:27:55.130" style="s2">be right</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.460" end="00:27:57.350" style="s2">that&#39;s disenfranchised billions of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.130" end="00:28:01.100" style="s2">people and made them desperately poor at</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.350" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">the edges of deserts so so how do we how</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.100" end="00:28:05.690" style="s2">do we address these how do we connect</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:08.330" style="s2">those two issues how do we say oh look</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.690" end="00:28:10.370" style="s2">they&#39;re reforesting they&#39;re restoring</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.330" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">the grasslands they&#39;re restoring the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.370" end="00:28:15.500" style="s2">wetlands like that&#39;s real value so</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:17.780" style="s2">that&#39;s got to be the basis of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:21.230" style="s2">that&#39;s got to be the basis of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.780" end="00:28:24.380" style="s2">economy so if that&#39;s the economy then</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.230" end="00:28:26.330" style="s2">you can give people an income for doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.380" end="00:28:28.220" style="s2">this and if you want to go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.330" end="00:28:29.960" style="s2">other way and you want to say okay we</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.220" end="00:28:31.130" style="s2">have to use business as usual because we</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.960" end="00:28:32.840" style="s2">have the governments and we have these</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.130" end="00:28:36.590" style="s2">capital formations and these are the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.840" end="00:28:39.530" style="s2">workers that you know you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.590" end="00:28:42.650" style="s2">this conversation with everyone not with</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.530" end="00:28:44.649" style="s2">me only but with everyone I know what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.650" end="00:28:48.769" style="s2">feel about it I&#39;ve been did</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.649" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">like you are preaching the converted</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.769" end="00:28:53.779" style="s2">we&#39;re on the say no I&#39;m talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:56.149" style="s2">and did anybody else who&#39;s watching this</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.779" end="00:28:58.460" style="s2">recording but but what what what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.149" end="00:29:00.830" style="s2">is but for me the only neurons where I</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.460" end="00:29:02.509" style="s2">feel like in terms of energy but what</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.830" end="00:29:04.759" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to explore with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.509" end="00:29:12.110" style="s2">but in not by saying that I&#39;m right or</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.759" end="00:29:14.269" style="s2">wrong is this M how to not be a divisive</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.110" end="00:29:20.210" style="s2">force between the dying world and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.269" end="00:29:21.769" style="s2">birth of that being and if it means in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.210" end="00:29:24.110" style="s2">the right moment at the right time not</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.769" end="00:29:27.379" style="s2">necessarily saying what is 100 percent</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.110" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">right but to build the bridge to stay to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.379" end="00:29:32.029" style="s2">keep people on board rather than to keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:34.700" style="s2">the frontiers coming up like right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.029" end="00:29:36.860" style="s2">what I see is M here my yoga lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.700" end="00:29:40.190" style="s2">unemployed people that have for decades</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.860" end="00:29:43.850" style="s2">only worked in tourism and all they know</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.190" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">is tourism for them to reconnect them to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.850" end="00:29:49.100" style="s2">the love of the island to the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:51.529" style="s2">la Isla de la calma the the calm islands</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.100" end="00:29:53.570" style="s2">that this place was and then to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.529" end="00:29:55.610" style="s2">reconnect them to the which is already</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.570" end="00:29:57.830" style="s2">happening right now in the crisis the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.610" end="00:29:59.690" style="s2">local farmers are starting that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.830" end="00:30:02.929" style="s2">I&#39;ve been for years been eating organic</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.690" end="00:30:04.909" style="s2">vegetable boxes from from a local farmer</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.929" end="00:30:08.379" style="s2">who I know who comes every Tuesday and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.909" end="00:30:11.720" style="s2">brings me part of that the harvest but M</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.379" end="00:30:14.779" style="s2">now everybody is experiencing that again</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.720" end="00:30:17.690" style="s2">like people are suddenly hearing news</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.779" end="00:30:20.779" style="s2">flashes about the local milk factory is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.690" end="00:30:22.460" style="s2">saying and we don&#39;t sell our milk to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.779" end="00:30:24.919" style="s2">tourists anymore because there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.460" end="00:30:27.049" style="s2">any tourists can we get the mayor keen</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.919" end="00:30:28.909" style="s2">to buy our milk again please and the</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.909" end="00:30:34.850" style="s2">mode instead of imported milk and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:39.230" style="s2">somehow this has turned up the contrast</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.850" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">on doing that great yeah but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.230" end="00:30:43.610" style="s2">the bizarre things like I mean for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.799" style="s2">vegans it&#39;s hard to hear but here on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.610" end="00:30:48.500" style="s2">island there were people who were just</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.799" end="00:30:50.840" style="s2">growing lambs for Easter for right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.500" end="00:30:52.250" style="s2">and they would kill the lamb just to</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.960" end="00:31:43.510" style="s2">and that&#39;s intense that&#39;s really intense</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.510" end="00:31:43.510" style="s2">this is not this is not happening here</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.870" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">we&#39;re asked to wear masks and gloves and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.740" end="00:31:54.169" style="s2">you know so we have masks and gloves and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:55.970" style="s2">I just right for the first time like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.169" end="00:31:59.029" style="s2">for me it&#39;s been such a teach others</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.970" end="00:32:01.429" style="s2">because I haven&#39;t thought as much about</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.029" end="00:32:03.740" style="s2">a punitive system that thinks it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.429" end="00:32:07.210" style="s2">to take people&#39;s freedom just because</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.740" end="00:32:10.639" style="s2">they&#39;ve sold a bit of weed and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.210" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">feeling now right now what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.639" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">just be locked in my own house and only</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.940" style="s2">be allowed out for one big shop once a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:19.130" style="s2">week and if they catch me any other way</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.940" end="00:32:21.889" style="s2">they can find me and think they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.130" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">controlling it like I&#39;m stuck in a flat</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.889" end="00:32:25.909" style="s2">my my mother&#39;s house is empty and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:27.500" style="s2">only 15 minutes away from here and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.909" end="00:32:30.139" style="s2">has a bit of garden where I could plant</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.500" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">stuff I&#39;m not legally allowed to move to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.139" end="00:32:35.659" style="s2">that house I would break the law if I</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:37.639" style="s2">did and there&#39;s police between here and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.659" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">there that would probably off us from</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.639" end="00:32:40.909" style="s2">getting there because you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:44.090" style="s2">more than one person in the car it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.909" end="00:32:47.090" style="s2">like suddenly I&#39;m living what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.090" end="00:32:49.789" style="s2">to be in an oppressed regime and and but</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.090" end="00:32:52.610" style="s2">I&#39;m also reason realizing how bloody</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.789" end="00:32:55.700" style="s2">fortunate I&#39;ve been that I&#39;d lived into</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.610" end="00:32:58.370" style="s2">my forties to have that experience like</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.700" end="00:33:00.019" style="s2">how privileged I have been in so many</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.370" end="00:33:02.029" style="s2">ways and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.019" end="00:33:03.950" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what this is doing to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.029" end="00:33:07.700" style="s2">so many people in different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.950" end="00:33:11.250" style="s2">that we if we learn also that all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.700" end="00:33:13.410" style="s2">menial workers that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.250" end="00:33:16.440" style="s2">in the streets asking for bigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.410" end="00:33:19.740" style="s2">salaries and now the ones keeping people</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.440" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">alive and keep systems going it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.740" end="00:33:29.880" style="s2">amazing so I think we I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:31.560" style="s2">this is a surprising moment I think it</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.880" end="00:33:33.540" style="s2">was described to me I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.560" end="00:33:37.800" style="s2">mentioned this to you earlier but this</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.540" end="00:33:39.750" style="s2">was described to me as a flux in time</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.800" end="00:33:42.270" style="s2">and space or something you know like</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.750" end="00:33:45.030" style="s2">there are new dimensions opening up and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.270" end="00:33:49.680" style="s2">you can go through a portal to the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.030" end="00:33:52.740" style="s2">side or you can fall through a hole you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.680" end="00:33:56.730" style="s2">know so like if we fail to keep our</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.740" end="00:33:59.880" style="s2">spirits up fail to survive this you fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.730" end="00:34:02.010" style="s2">through a hole if you and the millions</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.880" end="00:34:05.430" style="s2">millions of people are falling through</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.010" end="00:34:10.830" style="s2">the hole now that&#39;s the reality and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.430" end="00:34:13.320" style="s2">have to be aware that this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.830" end="00:34:18.180" style="s2">and also I think on the other side you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.320" end="00:34:22.260" style="s2">have these sort of reactionary I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.180" end="00:34:25.770" style="s2">it&#39;s almost fascist type responses so</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.260" end="00:34:27.570" style="s2">you see this emerging that that there</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.770" end="00:34:30.390" style="s2">are people who just want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.570" end="00:34:32.700" style="s2">control but it wasn&#39;t I mean I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.390" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">wonder what your opinion is on this</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.700" end="00:34:37.110" style="s2">because of course this discussion has</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:40.130" style="s2">been around now that that we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.110" end="00:34:43.260" style="s2">at this point either it&#39;s full taking</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.130" end="00:34:46.740" style="s2">responsibility direct participatory</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.260" end="00:34:48.930" style="s2">democracy on the ground people enabled</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.740" end="00:34:51.420" style="s2">by subsidiarity where they can make</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.930" end="00:34:54.630" style="s2">choices about their place their region</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.420" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">their community in global collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.630" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">or you get the ai-controlled super state</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:04.260" style="s2">like in China where people that ratings</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:06.690" style="s2">on how often they smile in class yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.260" end="00:35:09.930" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re gonna have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.690" end="00:35:13.050" style="s2">on a distributed horizontal way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.930" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">don&#39;t think you can have like even China</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.050" end="00:35:19.480" style="s2">experienced this early on in communism</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:22.330" style="s2">they tried to determine the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.480" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">what agricultural systems would be used</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.330" end="00:35:27.369" style="s2">or and that&#39;s ridiculous the local</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:30.460" style="s2">people know much more about here their</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.369" end="00:35:32.740" style="s2">biodiversity and what&#39;s growing in their</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.460" end="00:35:38.170" style="s2">region so it&#39;s it was it was a miserable</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.740" end="00:35:40.770" style="s2">failure so and I think the trend over</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.170" end="00:35:44.230" style="s2">historical time has been toward</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.770" end="00:35:47.590" style="s2">individual rights now that may have gone</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.230" end="00:35:50.500" style="s2">too far with these people who are sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.590" end="00:35:53.890" style="s2">of nihilistic there&#39;s a nihilism aspect</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.500" end="00:35:55.690" style="s2">to materialism where they don&#39;t nobody</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.890" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">cares about nobody believes in anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.690" end="00:36:00.970" style="s2">nobody cares about other people and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:03.609" style="s2">just want more stuff well that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.970" end="00:36:07.960" style="s2">gotta stop you know that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.609" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">the extreme expression of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.960" end="00:36:18.340" style="s2">possible stuff but where we are where we</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:21.490" style="s2">are now is that human civilization is at</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.340" end="00:36:24.250" style="s2">risk we talked about this at the at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.490" end="00:36:28.540" style="s2">Commonwealth Fame and we thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.250" end="00:36:31.210" style="s2">from climate change but so climate</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.540" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">change is an existential risk nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.210" end="00:36:36.940" style="s2">weapons are an existential risk they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:38.890" style="s2">all symptoms of you the no value system</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.940" end="00:36:43.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s human civilization that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.890" end="00:36:47.070" style="s2">risk not the earth or life and so what</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.210" end="00:36:50.020" style="s2">we need to do is we need to have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.070" end="00:36:54.010" style="s2">processing of what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.020" end="00:36:58.570" style="s2">beings and and that this is our time and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.010" end="00:37:01.060" style="s2">we are called to do certain things so</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.570" end="00:37:02.530" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to define and</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.060" end="00:37:05.910" style="s2">understand what are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.530" end="00:37:09.700" style="s2">we&#39;re called to do so we&#39;re called to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.910" end="00:37:12.430" style="s2">address the climate issues address the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.700" end="00:37:15.480" style="s2">ethological disruptions that have taken</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.430" end="00:37:20.080" style="s2">place over historical time we&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.480" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">to treat everyone equally find out find</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.080" end="00:37:24.970" style="s2">a way that human civilization can</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.210" end="00:37:29.290" style="s2">include everyone and engage everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.970" end="00:37:32.610" style="s2">empower everyone rather than enriching a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.290" end="00:37:35.490" style="s2">few and and disenfranchising billion</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.610" end="00:37:38.700" style="s2">if we don&#39;t take that step we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.490" end="00:37:43.230" style="s2">serious trouble now so we&#39;re at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.700" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">here of them but we also have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.230" end="00:37:48.710" style="s2">the toxicity and not only stop the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:53.100" style="s2">toxicity but we have to to clean it all</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.710" end="00:37:56.370" style="s2">we have to we have to take these blood</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.100" end="00:37:58.380" style="s2">feuds that are connected to thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.370" end="00:38:02.510" style="s2">years ago one brother killed another</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.380" end="00:38:04.890" style="s2">brother and lied about it and then now</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.510" end="00:38:06.810" style="s2">hundreds of generations later nobody</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.890" end="00:38:09.480" style="s2">remembers the original crime but</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.810" end="00:38:12.000" style="s2">everybody but this is so fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.480" end="00:38:13.980" style="s2">that it is like because what often</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.000" end="00:38:15.960" style="s2">happens because we&#39;re both very</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.980" end="00:38:19.430" style="s2">passionate about the ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.960" end="00:38:21.900" style="s2">restoration part but to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.430" end="00:38:25.560" style="s2">regeneration is also where you were just</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.900" end="00:38:27.900" style="s2">going is is also deeply social and it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.560" end="00:38:31.740" style="s2">actually trauma work and grief work and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.900" end="00:38:33.600" style="s2">and and going deep about understanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.740" end="00:38:35.460" style="s2">connection and the deeper questions who</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.600" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">are we where are we going why are we</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.460" end="00:38:40.290" style="s2">here who have we obliged to what is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:45.480" style="s2">to be human and is life a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.290" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">process or are we just am i fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.480" end="00:38:50.970" style="s2">individual survival it&#39;s I mean it the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:53.070" style="s2">whole worldview of even feeling trapped</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.970" end="00:38:54.900" style="s2">in the skin not understanding that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.070" end="00:38:57.240" style="s2">are walking ecosystem I&#39;m a walking</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.900" end="00:38:59.430" style="s2">ecosystem I&#39;m a talking ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.240" end="00:39:03.120" style="s2">restoration it starts with drinking some</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.430" end="00:39:06.210" style="s2">caffeine and and good clean water and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.120" end="00:39:11.390" style="s2">get the right microbiome in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.210" end="00:39:15.890" style="s2">gut huh I think I think it&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.390" end="00:39:20.550" style="s2">we we need to be considering an</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.890" end="00:39:24.710" style="s2">understanding of the evolution of human</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.550" end="00:39:31.830" style="s2">consciousness or the evolution of human</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.710" end="00:39:35.790" style="s2">knowledge so somehow yeah I was a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.830" end="00:39:37.890" style="s2">journalist so I just ran around taking</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.790" end="00:39:41.420" style="s2">pictures and showing people what was</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.890" end="00:39:43.840" style="s2">going on but then I started to research</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.420" end="00:39:49.420" style="s2">ecology and when I did this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.840" end="00:39:53.730" style="s2">I realized that we all have a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.420" end="00:39:57.610" style="s2">limited understanding about things and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.730" end="00:40:01.570" style="s2">the further that you go in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.610" end="00:40:08.680" style="s2">the life systems on the earth the sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.570" end="00:40:15.910" style="s2">of more grounded or more more more aware</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.680" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">you are of how fragile life is so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.910" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">all living for a few decades and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:29.130" style="s2">it and it happens you know life I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:37.420" style="s2">say death is easy</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.130" end="00:40:40.120" style="s2">life is hard so it&#39;s hard to live where</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.420" end="00:40:45.010" style="s2">you&#39;re conscious of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.120" end="00:40:48.250" style="s2">where your your life&#39;s energy is focused</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.010" end="00:40:51.430" style="s2">and concentrated and making something</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.250" end="00:40:54.310" style="s2">manifest and I think these are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.430" end="00:40:55.600" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve been learning about how</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.310" end="00:40:59.590" style="s2">do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.600" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">and you don&#39;t do it by yourself we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.590" end="00:41:08.700" style="s2">meta organisms so when we when we only</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:11.080" style="s2">think of ourselves we&#39;re very limited</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.700" end="00:41:13.690" style="s2">but when we stop thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.080" end="00:41:19.510" style="s2">ourselves but we think about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.690" end="00:41:22.090" style="s2">more collaborative and more larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.510" end="00:41:24.430" style="s2">I mean Einstein said if if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.090" end="00:41:27.360" style="s2">solve the problem make it bigger you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.430" end="00:41:30.970" style="s2">know I think that&#39;s a very good idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.360" end="00:41:32.890" style="s2">make it bigger and when you make it</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.970" end="00:41:35.980" style="s2">bigger you go well I can&#39;t deal with</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.890" end="00:41:38.710" style="s2">that personally but then you realize</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.980" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">well there is an agency that can take</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.710" end="00:41:45.670" style="s2">care of that it&#39;s humanity if the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:48.100" style="s2">worldview is that we&#39;re all part of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.670" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re moving forward that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.100" end="00:41:53.530" style="s2">our interests and the interests of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:57.050" style="s2">children and future generations to work</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.530" end="00:41:58.430" style="s2">for the ecological systems and let me</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.050" end="00:42:00.070" style="s2">ask a question there because that for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.430" end="00:42:02.990" style="s2">this is a really interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.070" end="00:42:06.890" style="s2">because I can sometimes also fall a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.990" end="00:42:09.290" style="s2">little bit into the kind of belief where</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.890" end="00:42:11.840" style="s2">I said like if we only all kind of had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.290" end="00:42:12.950" style="s2">full understanding of astronaut Han</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.840" end="00:42:15.260" style="s2">interbeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.950" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">type like the story of interbeing being</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.260" end="00:42:21.110" style="s2">connected if we all were just keen to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:23.090" style="s2">live the questions together and create</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.110" end="00:42:26.410" style="s2">regenerative cultures as the language I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.090" end="00:42:29.180" style="s2">would be using here and but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.410" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">increasingly thinking is that as human</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.180" end="00:42:37.340" style="s2">development whether you use like</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:40.310" style="s2">if you just using that as an example of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.340" end="00:42:41.960" style="s2">the kind of dynamics of how people go</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.310" end="00:42:44.120" style="s2">through different stages and go from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.960" end="00:42:47.570" style="s2">sort of egocentric to a family centric</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.120" end="00:43:01.850" style="s2">tribe centric specie centric life</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.570" end="00:43:04.810" style="s2">centric goes one moment just how long do</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.850" end="00:43:09.700" style="s2">you think we&#39;re going to need because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.810" end="00:43:09.700" style="s2">let&#39;s wrap it up in ten minutes okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.370" end="00:43:30.890" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s so nice to hear from people</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.430" end="00:43:35.660" style="s2">because I&#39;m still sort of I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.890" end="00:43:41.390" style="s2">houseguest but I&#39;m I&#39;m trapped lovely</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.660" end="00:43:43.940" style="s2">family here but yeah just like there was</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.390" end="00:43:46.310" style="s2">this key point of basically how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.940" end="00:43:48.020" style="s2">need to like rather than assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.310" end="00:43:50.260" style="s2">we somehow manage to get everybody on</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.020" end="00:43:52.190" style="s2">board and really actors how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.260" end="00:43:53.840" style="s2">actually work with the system where</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.190" end="00:43:56.690" style="s2">they&#39;ll always be some people who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.840" end="00:43:58.340" style="s2">still on the journey and who everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.690" end="00:44:00.500" style="s2">is on the journey yeah yeah soon</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.340" end="00:44:03.110" style="s2">everybody somewhere on the journey and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.500" end="00:44:07.970" style="s2">that journey leads to another dimension</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.110" end="00:44:10.010" style="s2">when we leave this dimension and so in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.970" end="00:44:11.930" style="s2">while we&#39;re in this to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.010" end="00:44:16.510" style="s2">and while we&#39;re together in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.930" end="00:44:21.800" style="s2">dimension we need to see that actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.510" end="00:44:28.609" style="s2">what we what we think what we do what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.800" end="00:44:30.890" style="s2">say how we act all has an impact and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.609" end="00:44:33.109" style="s2">I think in terms of what we are what</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.890" end="00:44:35.420" style="s2">we&#39;re mainly talking about right now we</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.109" end="00:44:40.820" style="s2">have a society which is in great</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.420" end="00:44:43.790" style="s2">confusion so the it&#39;s polarized in</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.820" end="00:44:47.990" style="s2">different ways it&#39;s it&#39;s all over the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.790" end="00:44:50.210" style="s2">place it&#39;s a mess we&#39;re in the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.990" end="00:44:53.300" style="s2">parlance we&#39;re living in interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.210" end="00:44:55.790" style="s2">times which is not a good thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.300" end="00:44:58.670" style="s2">we would rather we would rather look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.790" end="00:45:01.609" style="s2">the moon and drink warm wine and write</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.670" end="00:45:04.850" style="s2">poetry but instead who are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.609" end="00:45:10.040" style="s2">these these enormous forces which are</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.850" end="00:45:14.980" style="s2">changing society and we know we know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.040" end="00:45:17.720" style="s2">mistakes in the economy we know the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.980" end="00:45:23.030" style="s2">the mistakes the corruptions in</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.720" end="00:45:27.710" style="s2">governance we know the lack of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.030" end="00:45:32.150" style="s2">and which takes away the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.710" end="00:45:34.910" style="s2">from the from the people which is a big</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.150" end="00:45:37.460" style="s2">mistake because the people have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.910" end="00:45:40.609" style="s2">power and the ability and the majority</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.460" end="00:45:43.609" style="s2">of people are good this is I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.609" end="00:45:45.980" style="s2">what I&#39;ve mainly learned and what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.609" end="00:45:48.590" style="s2">would say about this that you what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.980" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">just said about that that having</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.590" end="00:45:55.340" style="s2">everybody we&#39;re not going to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:57.619" style="s2">everybody we don&#39;t need everybody yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.340" end="00:46:00.170" style="s2">everybody will do what their ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.619" end="00:46:04.130" style="s2">they&#39;re going to do we need a critical</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.170" end="00:46:08.600" style="s2">mass and this critical mass has to see</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.130" end="00:46:12.890" style="s2">that okay whether it happens quickly or</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.600" end="00:46:15.020" style="s2">it happens gradually or it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.890" end="00:46:18.290" style="s2">fits and starts or however it happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.020" end="00:46:21.730" style="s2">we&#39;re going in another direction we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.290" end="00:46:23.450" style="s2">going toward an ecologically bio diverse</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.730" end="00:46:27.460" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.450" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">earth systems and we&#39;re going toward a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.460" end="00:46:33.800" style="s2">human civilization so I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:36.830" style="s2">actually make sure that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.800" end="00:46:40.040" style="s2">discussion about primacy and about</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.830" end="00:46:42.500" style="s2">secondary systems so governance and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.040" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">economics these are secondary systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.500" end="00:46:48.100" style="s2">the private and primary system is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:50.300" style="s2">are the oxygenated atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.100" end="00:46:53.000" style="s2">hydrological cycle the soil fertility</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.300" end="00:46:55.490" style="s2">and the biodiversity so we have to know</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.000" end="00:46:58.430" style="s2">this and we have to understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.490" end="00:47:03.110" style="s2">gradual trend in human civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.430" end="00:47:06.590" style="s2">toward human rights for dignity toward</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.110" end="00:47:10.900" style="s2">freedom toward justice now those things</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.590" end="00:47:12.110" style="s2">are threatened by fascism by</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.900" end="00:47:17.240" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.110" end="00:47:21.800" style="s2">by and by corruption taken by by lies</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.240" end="00:47:24.440" style="s2">and by those who wish to control by</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.800" end="00:47:27.020" style="s2">violence you know the majority people</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.440" end="00:47:30.140" style="s2">they&#39;re not interested in violence but</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.020" end="00:47:32.390" style="s2">somebody is so somebody is arming vast</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.140" end="00:47:34.100" style="s2">numbers of people with huge huge things</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.390" end="00:47:37.850" style="s2">but the great thing about being a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.100" end="00:47:41.630" style="s2">journalist was I saw the armies refused</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.850" end="00:47:43.970" style="s2">to fire and the collapse of the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.630" end="00:47:46.370" style="s2">Union and this changes in East Europe</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.970" end="00:47:49.430" style="s2">because the armies are the children of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.370" end="00:47:52.820" style="s2">the people so when push comes to shove</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.430" end="00:47:55.250" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna do what some horrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.820" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">tyrant wants them to do they&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.560" end="00:48:10.940" style="s2">happened with the collapse of the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.390" end="00:48:14.420" style="s2">Union that the leaders issued live</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.940" end="00:48:16.370" style="s2">ammunition and the the troops and all</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.420" end="00:48:19.490" style="s2">kinds of country said no I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.370" end="00:48:22.100" style="s2">I will and that&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.490" end="00:48:24.950" style="s2">you know if the guy says shoot them you</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.579" end="00:48:43.539" style="s2">but even even what happened in the last</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.829" end="00:48:47.039" style="s2">four weeks that and ultimately the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.539" end="00:48:50.679" style="s2">over people were willing to take this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.039" end="00:48:52.209" style="s2">the destructive murderous economic</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.679" end="00:48:54.670" style="s2">system that has actually killed more</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.209" end="00:48:56.920" style="s2">people than the virus and drive it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.670" end="00:49:00.429" style="s2">against the wall pretty much in order to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.920" end="00:49:03.279" style="s2">save the old and the weak and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.429" end="00:49:06.819" style="s2">think that&#39;s it that&#39;s a sign that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.279" end="00:49:09.130" style="s2">not as horrible a species as sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.819" end="00:49:12.279" style="s2">we&#39;re taught in school and we should</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.130" end="00:49:14.739" style="s2">we&#39;re not a horrible species we&#39;re where</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.279" end="00:49:15.910" style="s2">human beings were just a flawed you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.739" end="00:49:18.729" style="s2">we&#39;re not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.910" end="00:49:21.369" style="s2">hmm you have choice we have freewill and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.729" end="00:49:24.699" style="s2">we often make the wrong the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.369" end="00:49:27.479" style="s2">decisions you know so so we need to also</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.699" end="00:49:30.009" style="s2">be gentle and forgiving and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.479" end="00:49:33.759" style="s2">compassionate and empathetic and realize</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.009" end="00:49:38.019" style="s2">that well nobody&#39;s perfect but but the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.759" end="00:49:41.199" style="s2">the closer we come to our ideals the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.019" end="00:49:44.410" style="s2">better we define our values and we act</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.199" end="00:49:47.890" style="s2">on our values the better things come out</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.410" end="00:49:51.039" style="s2">now I I think that where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.890" end="00:49:54.989" style="s2">now is that the ecosystem restoration</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.039" end="00:49:58.150" style="s2">camps is an idea whose time has come</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.989" end="00:50:00.459" style="s2">there the need for this is enormous it</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.150" end="00:50:04.979" style="s2">is the lowest cost and the highest</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.459" end="00:50:08.199" style="s2">outcome in terms of engaging people</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.979" end="00:50:11.289" style="s2">protecting people at this high risk</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.199" end="00:50:15.189" style="s2">moment and engaging them in what we need</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.289" end="00:50:17.859" style="s2">to do to ensure sustainability and</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.189" end="00:50:18.489" style="s2">survival of human civilization in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.859" end="00:50:21.849" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.489" end="00:50:24.509" style="s2">so so then when I would what I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.849" end="00:50:29.739" style="s2">recommend is all who understand this</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.509" end="00:50:32.739" style="s2">they need to come together and if that</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.739" end="00:50:36.479" style="s2">reaches critical mass whatever that may</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.739" end="00:50:39.609" style="s2">be whatever size you know but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.479" end="00:50:41.930" style="s2">everyone who understand it understands</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.609" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">it is an ally now</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.930" end="00:50:48.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s not about institution building</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:53.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not about personal gain</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.020" end="00:50:56.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not about one country or another</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.420" end="00:50:59.690" style="s2">it&#39;s about human civilization wherever</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.780" end="00:51:03.859" style="s2">they understand this acting to feed the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.690" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">people acting to give them temporary</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.859" end="00:51:11.210" style="s2">shelter so that no one unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:14.510" style="s2">suffers at this time and then within</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.210" end="00:51:16.190" style="s2">this in this infrastructure that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.510" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">talking about which is the cheapest way</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.190" end="00:51:24.020" style="s2">to do this collective eyes the central</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:26.660" style="s2">kitchens and feed everybody remove the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.020" end="00:51:28.430" style="s2">food from the transactional economics so</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.660" end="00:51:30.050" style="s2">that there&#39;s no food wasted I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.430" end="00:51:33.530" style="s2">idea that half of the food that&#39;s grown</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.050" end="00:51:34.550" style="s2">is thrown away or something like that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.530" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.550" end="00:51:43.550" style="s2">feed everybody now and then engage these</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:46.309" style="s2">people in ecosystem restoration in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.550" end="00:51:48.950" style="s2">gentle way I would recommend five hours</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.309" end="00:51:53.240" style="s2">a day five days a week and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.950" end="00:51:58.309" style="s2">the time study have slow food beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.240" end="00:52:01.970" style="s2">meals together do recreation slowly come</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.309" end="00:52:05.960" style="s2">back together after this crisis is over</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.970" end="00:52:08.329" style="s2">and built the future hmm so tell me</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.960" end="00:52:11.420" style="s2">before we wrap up maybe if I get this</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.329" end="00:52:14.420" style="s2">out before next Saturday and maybe tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.420" end="00:52:17.930" style="s2">me a little bit of a plan for what well</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.420" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">next Saturday is about Saturday Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.930" end="00:52:25.160" style="s2">is about maybe having this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.640" end="00:52:28.869" style="s2">that we&#39;re having but having it be in</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.160" end="00:52:34.520" style="s2">public and having it be very calm</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.869" end="00:52:36.799" style="s2">so trying we we think it&#39;s necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.520" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">instance the indigenous people in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.799" end="00:52:44.390" style="s2">region will open the conversation mhm</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">and there&#39;ll be many people talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.390" end="00:52:55.340" style="s2">about human human restoration societal</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.950" end="00:54:38.360" style="s2">Indian camp is in Bihar it&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.510" end="00:54:42.320" style="s2">crisis now there&#39;s a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.360" end="00:54:46.310" style="s2">people walking from Delhi to Bihar all</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.320" end="00:54:49.480" style="s2">the people who were sellers or you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.310" end="00:54:52.820" style="s2">street sellers or anything they&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.310" end="00:55:01.070" style="s2">they&#39;re worried about feeding them so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.340" end="00:55:04.670" style="s2">think I think they&#39;re gonna say hey this</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.070" end="00:55:08.600" style="s2">is maybe the sharp edge of the spear</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.670" end="00:55:09.410" style="s2">here and you know this is where we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.600" end="00:55:11.720" style="s2">also talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.410" end="00:55:14.270" style="s2">about how ecosystem restoration camps</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.720" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">movement can help in these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.270" end="00:55:17.270" style="s2">things and we have to look at this but</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.610" style="s2">people are suffering all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.270" end="00:55:21.560" style="s2">but I mean you&#39;re in another level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.610" end="00:55:24.020" style="s2">suffering if you&#39;re walking to Bihar and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.560" end="00:55:26.690" style="s2">you have no food when you get there you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.020" end="00:55:30.320" style="s2">know that I mean what I find is so</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.690" end="00:55:32.060" style="s2">important at this point is as you kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.320" end="00:55:33.770" style="s2">of was addressing earlier is to really</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.060" end="00:55:36.470" style="s2">link up all these networks because for</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.770" end="00:55:39.590" style="s2">example Ruth Andrade who works with lush</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.470" end="00:55:42.980" style="s2">mmm has been really active behind the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.590" end="00:55:45.140" style="s2">scenes with this The Blueprint Network</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.980" end="00:55:47.300" style="s2">which grew out of the the Eco village</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.140" end="00:55:50.900" style="s2">network but it&#39;s basically people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.300" end="00:55:53.510" style="s2">are permaculture agroforestry those kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.900" end="00:55:56.660" style="s2">of teachers who have experience of going</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.510" end="00:56:00.050" style="s2">into crisis areas and rebuilding after</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.660" end="00:56:03.050" style="s2">after disaster and and we I think we</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.050" end="00:56:05.420" style="s2">like that&#39;s where I feel why I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.050" end="00:56:08.060" style="s2">passionate as an educator about ERC&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.420" end="00:56:11.030" style="s2">that it&#39;s the the mechanism of scaling</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.060" end="00:56:13.160" style="s2">up the scaling up or scaling out the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.030" end="00:56:15.890" style="s2">scaling up getting more people engaged</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.160" end="00:56:19.130" style="s2">and really that means like I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.890" end="00:56:20.690" style="s2">excited to see education in ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.130" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2">restoration camps now doing this online</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.690" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">course where they highlight some really</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:27.500" style="s2">amazing story that my friend Galen with</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:32.390" style="s2">by matrix water who you met at fin horn</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.500" end="00:56:35.960" style="s2">and I think we really need to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.390" end="00:56:38.890" style="s2">movement together and EEOC&#39;s is it&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.960" end="00:56:41.960" style="s2">I would call it like a living laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.890" end="00:56:44.150" style="s2">that should be available to all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.960" end="00:56:46.910" style="s2">organizations and all the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.150" end="00:56:49.130" style="s2">who need to use it so all those people</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.910" end="00:56:52.670" style="s2">who studied permaculture for decades and</p>

<p begin="00:58:03.410" end="00:58:11.780" style="s2">and using it gets to set the value so</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.750" end="00:58:14.180" style="s2">when when people do more work they can</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.780" end="00:58:17.360" style="s2">get more value in their thing</p>
