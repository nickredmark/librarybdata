<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">wrestle with that problem in conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">with the problem that greg calls the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">descriptive metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">by which it talks about mind and or</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.120" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">cognitive scientific and neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">accounts of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">so i hope you&#39;ll join us through thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">you john great to be here</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">so greg i wanted to follow up on some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">the points we had gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">last time we&#39;ve been talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.520" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">you know aspectualization and things</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">and disrespectful knowing and what i</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">thought we&#39;d do is do a case study that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:21.920" style="s2">will help to make these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">uh more concrete and understandable but</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.920" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">it will also give me more information by</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">which i can advance the argument and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.200" style="s2">make proposals</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">about the nature of consciousness amen</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">that sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">yep okay so i&#39;m gonna do something i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.799" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">don&#39;t normally like to do especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">when we&#39;re in dialogue like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">uh but i am gonna sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">share my screen and because i got some</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:44.320" style="s2">slides um</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">because i&#39;m riffing off of the talk i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.320" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">given in two separate occasions</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">keep modifying it of course and i want</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:50.799" style="s2">to sort of run this with you and run</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.799" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">uh with you so well since i often share</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">slides john then it would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">uh this is you know this is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">this balances us out</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s fine for you okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">i want to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">oh i want to start with an</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">acknowledgement uh right from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">um why it&#39;s called seeing into being on</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">mars and beyond it&#39;s about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">nasa scientists on earth use the rovers</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">on mars in order to do field work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">right um and it&#39;s going to turn out that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">this is a very powerful case study</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">that will help us to tell uh get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">of more understanding about perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">and then another kind of knowing that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">think we&#39;ve alluded to a couple times</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">and then bring that into uh more</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">directly into the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">i do want to begin with an</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">acknowledgement that a lot of this work</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">is has been done and continues to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">done with another good friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">dan shappy who&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">university of california long beach and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">so we are doing this ongoing work</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">so i know i don&#39;t i i owe a lot to dan</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">in this argument i&#39;m not going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">referencing him so i want to give a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">global thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">right right up front right from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">beginning great</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">all right so the rovers on mars are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">really exemplary study</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">of a lot of the four e themes that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:22.159" style="s2">embodiment embedded enacted extended</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">um and the main problem i want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">at least initially in what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">through here</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">has to do with how the scientists using</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">only very limited</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">visual information nevertheless get</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">crucial to the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">they get a sense of presence they get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">on mars not just looking at pictures</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">that refer to mars</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">but the sense of being on mars and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s important because we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">been talking about that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">demonstrative indexicality of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">consciousness the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">you know that sense of here and now</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">togetherness this right</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">is here now togetherness that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">and this gives us a really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">case study for investigating that sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">of presence trying to tease it out more</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">and learn more about consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">the process that&#39;s part of what i want</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">to do here</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">and so i&#39;m going to go through something</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">which is a little bit along the way i</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">want to show how the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">the generation of theory you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">propositional knowing depends on</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">procedural abilities with the skills of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">what are called field work</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">yep that in turn depends on situational</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">awareness which is the primary thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">that is generated by perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">annoying and then i want to show</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">how that is ultimately dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">something deeper so um</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">seeing as if you&#39;re on mars depending</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">depends on seeing as if you&#39;re the rover</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a process of identification that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">takes place between the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">and the rover that is actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a presence and that&#39;s going to help</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">me articulate a bit more about what this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">participatory knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">now why is that relevant it&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">right off the bat</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">because consciousness has this weird</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">feature about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">that you know it in you don&#39;t only you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">not only know consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">perspectively</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to be here now you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">togetherness right we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">that the adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">right you know you&#39;re conscious by being</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">conscious you know you&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">by being conscious this is the core of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">participatory knowing it&#39;s knowing by</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about these</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">scientists is that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">take on the role of in in obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">in a literal sense but in a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">symbolic and active sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">they take on the role of being the rover</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">and that actually affords them</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">um the necessary situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">so i want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">go through with this one step at a time</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s be clear about a couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">things right from the beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">rover send back</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">batch pictures um you know and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">in black and white</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">there is no joystick control there is no</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">joystick control</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">uh because of the time delay between</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">earth and mars</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">no joystick control what happens is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">buck you know you get batches of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">pictures</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">and then you send in a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">commands and then it&#39;s a batch of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">commands is sent back out</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">and so and there&#39;s terrific time delay</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">so there&#39;s huge displacements in time</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">and space and type of environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">between the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">and the rover okay right</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the scientists on earth right</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">who are using the visual information</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">from the rover to correct you know to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">direct and correct the rover</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">what i mean by that is don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">the rover obviously has some ai</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">but don&#39;t think that the rover&#39;s ai is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">sufficient enough that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:42.319" style="s2">moving itself around</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">and doing any work in an autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.319" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">the scientists are the ones doing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">science through the rover</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">on mars okay so this is a clear case of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">examining what&#39;s called extended</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">extended cognition is the idea that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">lot of our cognition doesn&#39;t take place</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">in our head</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">it takes place uh through machines</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:03.400" style="s2">through tools</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">through other people through</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.400" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">discrimination it&#39;s a clear case of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">extended cognition</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">however so while it picks up on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">theme of extended cognition it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">deeply challenge</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">um the other e&#39;s i mean the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">are not embodied</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">right the body the rover body is on mars</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not embedded on mars and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">obviously not enacting on mars they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">on earth</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">typing code into a computer</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s all those problems now</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">given that most of the e&#39;s are missing</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">the embodiment and the embeddedness</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">right and the enacted aspects</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">one might suspect that people have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">very distant displaced</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">alienated experience uh of of mars</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">through this medium but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">actually the case</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">and this is the intriguing thing what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">scientists regularly and reliably report</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">that they feel like they&#39;re on mars they</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">sense being</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">on mars the way you right now sense that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in that room you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">and i sense that i&#39;m in the room i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">they have that sense of presence that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">which is really weird if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">they know what it&#39;s like to be a rover</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s very very odd uh so they</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">and they report that they&#39;re seeing as</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">the rover they&#39;re seeing as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">the rover</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">so john and just in terms of so they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">they get these batch photos right um and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">obviously these are scientists that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">with the machinery of the rover right in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">terms of or</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">or not i guess that&#39;s a question that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">would have in relation to varying</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">degrees</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">to varying degrees so they they</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">basically have sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">this dynamically restructuring small</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">world network way in which they organize</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">themselves and they have various degrees</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">of expertise and there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">are more specialized in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">managing and moving the rover and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">there&#39;s people who are more like</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">more like geologists and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">more like meteorologists things like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">um in a collective sense yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">definitely a gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">now what they what what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">the scientists who are in the group</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">because they often have to hire new</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">etc there&#39;s attrition new problems come</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">up etc</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">they report that they look for people</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">who can</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">ex who can have that experience who can</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">have that sense of presence a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">being on mars</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">because the scientists report that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">ability to generate that experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">is actually predictive of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">are able to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">good work with the rover okay do good</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:09:59.200" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">do good field work on mars so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.200" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">just some sort of weird thing that sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">of jangles over there</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a highly prized experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">that is predictive according to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">scientists at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">of good work okay all right</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">okay so given how disrupted the 4e</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.560" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">features are how is it the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">can never</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">the less acquire the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">markers of embeddedness in action</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">and even as we&#39;ll see later embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">how do they do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">and and of course all along why are we</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">sense of presence and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">understand that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">it has a lot to do uh with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">that is at the core of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">okay so far yep totally right</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">okay so we what&#39;s fortunate about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">and dan and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">uh you know we&#39;re lucky because we live</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">in the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">age of virtual reality uh video games</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">and so there&#39;s quite a bit of um</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a bit of research on sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">presence in video games what are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">features of a video game</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">that make people have that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">being in the game</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">and when they&#39;re correspondingly and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">this is important that it&#39;s more real to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">between sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">and sense of realness and uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">this because and the reason why the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">people are doing this research is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">is a highly sought after</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">feature of uh for example of a video</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">game so we have two video games</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">and this one reliably generates sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">and this one doesn&#39;t this one will be</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">preferred and we&#39;ll have much greater</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">chance of markets inside</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">over there so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">normative there&#39;s something inherently</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">valued probably an evolutionary marker</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">sense of presence seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.839" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">organisms</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">seek out um in about in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll try and cover that off</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">now why is that important well if we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">how sense of presence is adaptive and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">is a way of unders is a case where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">you know get into the guts of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">and a perspectival knowing is central to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">consciousness this will give us a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">getting it some of the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">consciousness involves perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">knowing which generates sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">presence and we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">functionality of sense of presence is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">we can start to answer the function</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">question and of course what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">interesting about sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">is it&#39;s not just a functional thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">deeply phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">it has a lot to do with the feel of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">being conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">and so we&#39;re getting what we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">about doing we&#39;re getting a case study</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">right where we can deeply look at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">function question</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">and the nature question together</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">okay okay now i&#39;m not going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.120" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">an exhaustive definition of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">presence but</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole thing but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">couple of key points that need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">um be made clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">as i said the sense of presence is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">sense of being there</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">uh that indexical sense of here now-ness</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">and togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">things with the adverbial qualia so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">the but the sense of presence is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">the adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">are happening just i mean that&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">and easy way of putting it um</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">so as i mentioned it has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">with the sense of realness and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">normative</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">okay now so given the vr</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">research virtual reality research right</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">what are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">things that tend to generate this sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">of presence</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:46.880" style="s2">and why does it have this normative</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">value for us why is it functional for us</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.880" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">why do we value it why do we seek it out</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">why do we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">even aesthetic approval for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">okay so a powerful intuition people have</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">is that what creates sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">is very similitude how realistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:07.440" style="s2">and this is because the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">realness you can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">like how realistic the game is is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">actually is conducive</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">uh to a sense of presence it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">it turns out that you can have you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">video games that are quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">realistic and you don&#39;t get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">presence and you can have video</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">other video games like tetris that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">generate a tremendous sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">even i was a tetris addict</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">right did you did you dream in tetris</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">yeah i mean when i was into it you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">i i pushed the limit on that thing i</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">was i was definitely into that game i i</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">was the boxes john</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">i was boxes well there you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:49.519" style="s2">so the interesting thing about it then</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.519" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">uh you get pretty like on both</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">you know so i could show it&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">neither is it necessary and so what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">not saying that very similitude can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">what i&#39;ve given you though is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">argument that it can&#39;t be essential</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.440" style="s2">actually this is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">because i did i felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.440" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">the shapes of the blocks you know i can</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">say i didn&#39;t i&#39;m really not</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">not really i can easily access that i</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">felt the shapes of the blocks and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">i felt the speed i felt the flow right</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.000" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">huh that&#39;s interesting yeah good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">well thank you that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">that that further corroborating evidence</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">helpful and wonderful okay so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">one of the interesting ideas is then to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">try and so what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">problematized this</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s not very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">well what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">so one of my uh uh former students uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">gary</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">over hennison um in 2019 argued</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">um that what what is predictive</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">of the sense of presence is to get into</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">so if you&#39;re in the flow state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what predicts a sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">and this is of course very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">because when people are in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">state they they</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">state that they&#39;re at one with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">environment the environment is super</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">salient there&#39;s an ongoing sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">discovery</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">right so it&#39;s a very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">hypothesis because it&#39;s very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">that you could have a realistic game</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t get you into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">and therefore you don&#39;t get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">presence but you could be in tetris and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">etc okay so this this is i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">this is a very plausible account</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">uh for video games</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">however the problem is flow&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">to be the answer for the situation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">studying</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">because what you need for flow according</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">to chicks at my high and all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">replicated work</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">you know what i need for flow is three</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">conditions error has to matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">well moving the rovers around error</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">matters that&#39;s so that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">right if i screw up that&#39;s it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">rover&#39;s done to put so that&#39;s there but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">the two other things i need for</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">flow is i need clear signal and i need</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">tightly coupled feedback</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">but you know what the scientists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">have they don&#39;t have tightly coupled</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have joystick control</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">like in a video game</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">right they don&#39;t and they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">clear signal they spend</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">hours arguing over these</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">deeply ambiguous pictures that come back</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">from mars</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">so they don&#39;t have clear signal they</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">tightly coupled feedback so it looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">like this proposal</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">that seems to be very plausible for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">getting sense of presence in video games</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">is not going to work for the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">on mars</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">right but what i can</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">what i can uh argue is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">flow contains within it a more basic</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">that can be nevertheless the case on</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2">mars</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">all right so maybe flow contains within</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">it a more basic phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">so maybe flow is a species of a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">generic</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">process and that generic process might</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">be sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">for explaining the sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">okay so this is the process uh that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">coming up a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">in 40 cognitive science the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">now clearly what&#39;s happening in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">state is a state of enhanced optimal</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">grip</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">so what&#39;s optimal grip this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">yeah right the idea that right</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">i&#39;m constantly trading off between you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">features and gestalt between familiar</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">and unfamiliar between the foreground</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">and the background</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m constantly toggling between all</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">these trade-off relationships</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">to get the overall optimal set</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">of features and properties that will</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">enable</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">me to deal with the tasks that are at</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">hand i&#39;m getting an</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">optimal grip on the situation now flow</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">is a species of optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">but there are many instances for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">i think i</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">have a pretty good optimal grip on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">face right now but i&#39;m not sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">in the flow state right so what i want</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">to propose to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">is the flow state is sort of like where</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">you&#39;ve got insights that are creating</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">new instances of optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually the optimal grip that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">is generating the sense of presence okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">so so let me just summarize so we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">we can create an</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">a spectralizing form right</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">around uh the entity</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">and system that we&#39;re in and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">to basically now</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">pull that a specializing form and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">start to engage</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">a process with it in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">that generates a dynamic engaging</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">feedback in a way that allows for say a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">flow of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">energy or whatever kind of you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">of dynamic in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">investment path i might say yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">that&#39;s well put um yes i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">actually very well put so the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">is the scientists are able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">nevertheless in this very thin</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">information channel</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">use it with some cultivated expertise to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">get the ultimate optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">that starts to make mars opens up</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">affordances of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">for them from mars um so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">very much in concert with what you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:32.840" style="s2">said is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">a hundred percent yeah absolutely okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.840" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">all right so i&#39;ve said you know what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">what optimal grip is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve given some components of it gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">already uh when we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">uh consciousness so uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s just keep going</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">and so here&#39;s the idea i thought this</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">was uh because we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">aspectuality and centrality and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">temporality before</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">um and so this is the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">up you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.440" style="s2">optimal grip is</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">toggling things so things are that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.440" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">aspectularized</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">they are relevant to you they&#39;re sent</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">and they&#39;re they are temporally</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:18.400" style="s2">so you get optimal grip that is giving</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">you a salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.400" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">moving between aspectuality centrality</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">and temporality and when that salience</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">glues you into right the affordances in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">the environment right you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">feel a sense of press right you feel a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">right okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">all right so i want to call this</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">optimal grip sizing up salience</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">that affords situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">because that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">right that&#39;s what situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">is it&#39;s the salience landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">glues you in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">to the affordances in the environment i</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">want to call that whole thing something</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve already been talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">perspectival knowing right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">perspectival knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s knowing what it&#39;s like to be here</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">now through in both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">my current state of mind okay yep so</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">again deeply part of that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">made famous by nagel knowing what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">like to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">okay go ahead go ahead no i was just</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">gonna offer</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">uh just sort of an angle on this so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">been researching the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">animal consciousness okay right um and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">a really interesting 2017 book i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">it was on the evolution animal conscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:41.520" style="s2">or whatever it was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">you know a plane of intersection between</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">interoceptive awareness like what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">body is telling</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">extra receptive awareness and pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">affectivity you know um so just in</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">relationship to what is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">uh optimal grip doing bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">information in a gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">understanding where the body wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">finding the affordances and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">potential costs</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">is a nice intersection i think that then</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">you know corresponds to potentially sets</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">the stage for</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">this field of perspectival knowing i i</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">think that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">um i know the book you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">i haven&#39;t i can&#39;t remember the authors</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">as well right now so</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">um we&#39;re both getting old i guess um so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">okay so my my my the main claim i&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">argued too</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">is that the sense of presence is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">phenomenological feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">of and of and marker for perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">sense of presence is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">phenomenological feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">of respectable knowing okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">so how do scientists generate this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">perspectival knowing how do they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">see as if they&#39;re the rover and the part</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">of the argument i&#39;m going to make is</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">they see as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">they&#39;re over by uh c right</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">by by by being the rover uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">in a very important way um</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">all right so for tessie in her excellent</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">book seeing like a rover</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">um talks about this so it&#39;s an extended</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">ethnography</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">she was an anthropologist she went there</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">she&#39;s kind of there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">ethnographies that corroborate cohere</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a work that right so extended</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">ethnography</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">and she um she talks about this process</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s very interesting uh what she</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">calls drawing</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">ads so the drawing as so</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">it&#39;s based on um well it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">aspectualization because it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">wittgenstein&#39;s notion of seeing ads</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">remember your example of you see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">picture as a duck</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">or you see it as a rabbit right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">a spectralization that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">she&#39;s talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">so what happens is the scientists get</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">these pictures</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">right these photos and what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">they mark them up</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">they put color on them they put lines on</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">them they put arrows on them</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">they do all this stuff to manipulate the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">salience</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">so and she calls this drawing as and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">she&#39;s actually playing on the word</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.679" style="s2">because she means drawing as in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">sense of drawing</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.679" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">but also drawing out right now yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">so that you can see it as and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">is you get this black and white picture</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">and you do all this stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">actually not vera similitude</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">you&#39;re putting colors on it and all this</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">right right you&#39;re drawing on it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">in in you know in a sense of precision</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">you&#39;re distorting the picture but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">distort it in the way so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">you can then start it as specializes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">you can see it as you go</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a depression there</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">right the the the topography go oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">oh i see right and there&#39;s a textured</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">gradient there things have</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">rolled down that hill they look for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">pop out kind of effect right so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">then by putting that angle on it they</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">pull various aspects of the salience</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">together right exactly so what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">doing is they&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">deliberate salience manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">right so they&#39;re they&#39;re deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">salience landscaping right externally</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">on the pictures in order to aspectulize</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">that information and then what that does</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">is that makes it available for problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">solving</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">okay so they&#39;re doing all of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">and when they start to do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">right they start to get a bit of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">but seeing as if you&#39;re being on mars</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">really depends on</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">and more than just this drawing so one</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">half of the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">the drawing as and it fits right into</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">this analysis</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">beautifully that we&#39;ve been making</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">together about consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:00.840" style="s2">respectable knowing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">and salience landscaping and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.840" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">and all of that stuff right great but</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">there&#39;s more to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">okay so i talked about the the drawing</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">as i not we don&#39;t need to go through</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">every um single slide in detail here</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s up there people want to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">first testy so we&#39;ve got the drawing as</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">process and then vertex talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">other set of practices people the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">scientists do</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">so first of all they anthropomorphize</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">the rover they don&#39;t say the rover needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:36.399" style="s2">to go there they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">i need to go there or we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.399" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">there we need i need to move my arm</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">which means that one of the rovers tools</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">right and they&#39;ll talk about the rover</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">falling asleep and waking up and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to die</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">right so they anthropomorphized they do</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">you know symbolic identification process</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">they do more than just anthropomorphize</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">they also and this is a term i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">coined by vertexi</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">they technomorphize themselves they</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">technomorphize themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">so here&#39;s um um the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">uh the uh sense of presence talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">i call it the second sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">because this is a sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">actually being used by the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">rather than just one making us feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">wonderful about</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">mars okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s just why the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">slide has that title okay so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">scientists</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">and notice what the scientists do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">is technomorphizing so the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">that she&#39;s trying to figure out right</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">how to adjust the rover and so she puts</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">her phone down in front and says</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">you know this the phone is a rock and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">then you know these are my cameras and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">she&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">like a wheelchair and she starts to turn</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">her body and then swivel</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">and move and this is what she&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">this is what i need to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">and she&#39;s using the i language this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">what i need to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">in order to like get this</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">needed information from</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">the rover</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.279" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">so there&#39;s this loop that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">there&#39;s this right anthropomorphizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">from human to rover</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">but also technomorphizing from rover to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">so there&#39;s this reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">shaping of identity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">humanizing the rover but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">mechanizing you but if</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s even a verb right uh this the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">human beings the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">and so what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">this reciprocal shaping</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">of identities</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">so i just want i want to read this out i</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">won&#39;t i know i&#39;m not usually going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">read from</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">uh but just because the wording here is</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">careful and there&#39;s a couple more things</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">i&#39;m going to have to read i have to read</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:56.720" style="s2">them for the exp</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">explicit reason that i&#39;m quoting i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.720" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">literally quoting the scientists okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">so i know reading is a little bit rude i</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">apologize i i will keep it to a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">here we&#39;ll keep it to a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s an inactive integration of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">knowing oneself</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">through the rover and and knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">rover through oneself</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">so that one is simultaneously knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">oneself</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">knowing the rover and knowing through</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">the rover all of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">at the same time which of course is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">to how you know your body all right you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">know yourself by knowing your body you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">by right as having a body but you also</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">know yourself through the body you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">the world through the body</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">so they&#39;re doing something that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">structurally analogous to embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">really powerful way now</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">this mutual shaping is very analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">in niche construction mutually shapes an</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">organism in its environment</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">or how culture mutually shapes you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">uh its participants in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">and why does why</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">why what does this mutual shaping do</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">well it generates affordances</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">um so here&#39;s a classic example this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">cop</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">okay so because of evolution here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">affordance it&#39;s graspable we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">about something like that before</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">right so biologically right because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">niche construction</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">i can grasp it right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">uh my hand has evolved to fit</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">certain shapes in the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s niche construction right</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">culturally it&#39;s a tool it&#39;s a cut and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve been shaped to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">drinker and then of course i have my</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">ongoing situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">that i can actually use it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">biological affordances</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">there are cultural affordances and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">there&#39;s my direct awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">of how i can use those affordances</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">to get a drink right here right now okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">so i want to call that process</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">by which agent and environment</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">are co-shaped agents in arena</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">so that affordances are generated</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">i want to call that participatory</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s a knowing by being</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a knowing by being a particular</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">kind of agent and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">being in a particular kind of arena it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">a knowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">by being it&#39;s a knowing by being</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">right so what we&#39;re saying is the agent</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">the the the agent has a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">agent it is in the arena that it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">right uh i mean that sounded maybe uh i</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">was being redundant there to just</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">emphasize the dynamic relation no i</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">think that was helpful i think that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">i think that what you just did wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">it might have been syntactically</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">reductive</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">redundant but i didn&#39;t think i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">think it was semantically redundant i</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s one of these quotes i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">going to read and again i</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">because i want to show you the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">phenomenology i want to make it clear to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">people that i&#39;m not attributing things</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">to the scientists okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">this is a quote from that woman who you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">who you saw the drawing of right</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.840" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">who would put the rock down in front she</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">says my body by the way is always the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">rover</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">this is a hard-nosed scientist or nasa</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">my body by the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">is always the rover so right here touch</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">his chest is the front of the rover</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">my magnets are right here touches the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">base of her neck and my shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">are the front of the solar panel and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">that means she moves forward and splays</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">her arms up</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">to other sides the rest of it so i have</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">all kinds of things and 10 is sticking</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">up over here adjusting to her back</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">laughs</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">but when i&#39;m taking a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">something in the atmosphere then it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">helps me to kind of look up</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">looks sits up and looks straighter being</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">the rover</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:54.399" style="s2">and this is the front of me touches the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">chest and then i put my head up</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.399" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">puts head up and looks back and forth uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">whatever to whichever vector i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">so you see what like she&#39;s she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">completely identifying with the rover</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">in an embodied enacted way</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">so another scientist had this to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">because i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">what this sense of identification does</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">some other phenomenological markers</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">so another scientist said i was working</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">in the garden one day and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">sudden</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with my</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">right wrist i cannot move it</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">out of nowhere i get here to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">planning meeting</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">and spirit that&#39;s one of the rovers has</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">its right front wheel stuck</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">things like that you know i am totally</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">to spirit no pun intended there but</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">right like you see what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">borders on being magical such that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">identification is such</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">that right these weird synchronicities</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">become super salient to the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">another scientist said something similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">to say interestingly i screwed up my</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">shoulder and needed surgery</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">right about the time that opera</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">opportunities idd</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">arm started having problems with a stiff</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">shoulder joint</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">and i broke my toe right before spirit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">wheel broke so i&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s kind of sympathetic i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any magic</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">involved or anything but maybe it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">kind of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">subconscious thing i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">try to show you how deep this</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:35.240" style="s2">participatory knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s deep it&#39;s very profound it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.240" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">very very present to the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">so notice we&#39;ve got two things going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">here we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">a coordinated manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">perspectival knowing through the drawing</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">and a manipulation of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">through this this anthropomorphic</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">technomorphic looping and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">you get the sense of presence you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">the sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">of being on mars you get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">the rover on mars and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">sense is functional because it allows</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">to do the best field work through the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">rovers</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">on mars</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">of course all of this is being done</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">implicitly and tacitly they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">none of the scientists they discovered</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">this for themselves no but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">go to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">wow how to improve field work on mars</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">you know do this or do</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">they they have they have like</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">sort of right implicitly and tacitly</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">figured this all out in a collective</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.560" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">yes yes they&#39;ve drawn on their intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">tendency for participatory knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">embody this</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">let&#39;s zero in on that connection now</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">the situational awareness that is given</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">to me by a sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">so what is what am i proposing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">proposing that participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">generates affordances and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">perspective on knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">turns those affordances into salient</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">affordances and salient affordances</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">within salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">is what we mean by situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">situational awareness is the state you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">need to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">in order to acquire and apply skills</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">situational awareness is the state you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">need to have in order to acquire and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">apply</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">skills so the procedural ability knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">how to do something</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">is dependent on the perspective of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">knowing what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">which is of course also dependent and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">interrelated with</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">you know knowing how to knowing no not</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">knowing by being the rover that&#39;s normal</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">right here</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">okay so now i want to i want to zero in</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">an important feature of skills so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">will seem like a digression for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">argument built up here over here about</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">uh perspectival knowing participatory</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">knowing situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">uh generating affordances making them</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">salient</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:30.839" style="s2">uh et cetera that&#39;s all here so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">trying to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">right now i want to the bridge of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">acquiring and applying skills but i want</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">to note something very important about</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">skills now this goes to the work of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">the neuroscientist reed montague he</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">sounds like a shakespearean figure right</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">who do we need now we need montague</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">and so he wrote a really uh he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:56.680" style="s2">really interesting book a while ago not</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">that long ago i think it was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.680" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">2010 i&#39;m not i&#39;m not sure i have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">check</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">i had a really provocative title it said</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">your brain is almost perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">which is a really interesting um title</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">for a book</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">you&#39;re going to of course you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">to pick that book up right</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">so anyways uh he makes the he</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">he first of all poses a problem um</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s direct it&#39;s at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">okay so if i&#39;m going to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">skillful behavior</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">uh i want of course i want to be as</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">efficient as i possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">right because if i if you and i are in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">competition and i can use some skill</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:39.599" style="s2">more efficiently than you</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">i&#39;m going to out-compete you right here</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.599" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.599" style="s2">so let&#39;s say that&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">non-controversial</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.599" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">okay so how do i make my skills more</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">efficient well one of the things you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">and you of course think about how much</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">you have to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">in order to right you just</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">have to coordinate different things</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">together or let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">let&#39;s even use an analogy you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">to get a bunch of people to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">work together well they have you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">coordinate their behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">well how do you coordinate their</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">behavior well they have to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">right and then right and there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">communication between the parts of my</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">etc via the brain etc so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">okay i increase the efficiency of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">by increasing the internal communication</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">because that reduces</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">me working at cross purposes okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">working in internal conflict</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">etc so i can increase coordination</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">right and that&#39;s my increased</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">communication okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">but montague says but wait there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">the problem with that is right what</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">efficiency does</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">efficiencies not only improve the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">product efficiency is also reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">right right and he says the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">as you increase communication right is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">the cost</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">of your processing goes up and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">up in a non-linear fashion</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s why that&#39;s where you can get</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">the effect of all the people in the room</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">there&#39;s so much cacophony and noise</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">right and trying to get that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">right so the metabolic cost goes up</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">very rapidly so the brain seems like he</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">says it looks like the brain&#39;s caught in</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">a dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">it needs to increase if it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">increase efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">by increasing communication and it needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">to increase efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">by reducing communication by reducing</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">communications</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s all these important</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">trade-off relationships</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">okay so montague says proposes that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">actually has a really powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">solving</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">this problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">now in order to explain it he i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">to use his analogy um okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">and the analogy is of a a a a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">a like an old married couple that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">they&#39;re happily married</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">uh some people stay married so that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">can torture each other i</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">understand that so we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">about that we&#39;re talking about people</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">have been together a long time and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">want to be together</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">and they have that almost telepathy they</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">seem to be able to communicate a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">with very little</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">um i had a beloved aunt and uncle that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">had exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">that kind of relationship i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">everybody knows sure i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">well they don&#39;t actually have telepathy</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">um so montgomery says well what hack</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">what what do they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">is let&#39;s say i&#39;ll just uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">uh i&#39;ll just use his model it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">be uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a model based on a straight</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">marriage but that&#39;s not relevant but</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">i&#39;m going to use it because it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">for me to do the reference sure right</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:39.839" style="s2">i can just talk about the man and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:41.760" style="s2">woman it just makes it faster and easier</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.839" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">nothing else is implied by my by using</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">those terms about marriage or anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">like that okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">so the woman has internalized a model</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">of the man and the man has internalized</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">a model of the woman</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">there&#39;s what&#39;s called mutual modeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">they they mutually model</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">each other so that the woman can</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">actually have her behavior coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">with the man</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">without them having to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">other because she just consults her</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">and he just consults his model so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">the right you have you see you what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">seem to be getting with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">is the benefits of increased</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">communication without actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">communicating</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">and thereby keeping the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.839" style="s2">communication down</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">and so montague sort of leaves it at</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.839" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">right and i want to i want to do a</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">couple things to try and enforce</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">he just makes the claim that there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">kinds of evidence that the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">and at a neuroscientific level you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">i&#39;m sure he&#39;s right i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">challenge it but i want to i want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">bring up</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">sort of evidence that has a more</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:45.280" style="s2">phenomenological feel to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">okay of this okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.280" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">so one is uh synesthesia</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">so synesthesia is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">um you you get human beings in which the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">you the information from one sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">modality seems to pass to the other like</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">people say i can taste</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">shapes right things that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">classic example</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">and what that means is that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">you&#39;ve got sort of the tactile layer of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">or at least one plausible explanation</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">right and the taste area of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">right actually deeply mutually modeling</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:25.839" style="s2">you get you can get actually acquired</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">synthesis your two famous examples and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.839" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">think of how this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">right okay so you have bat boy and think</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">about thomas nagel is what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">be a bat</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">okay so the batboy well there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">now i think 128 cases of this so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">not some weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">loopy single case right he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">blind</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">and he tried himself like a bat he</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">taught himself echo location</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">he taught himself to make noises and use</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">the sound</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">and he reports having something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">visual experience but also not like</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">visual experience and it&#39;s he says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">sort of out here</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">about this big so</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">he is using sound to do something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">seeing we also know</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">and this is reported by walsh and others</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">and something i can</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">said to as well long-term meditators</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.079" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">tend to get acquired synesthesia</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">they tend to start to get synesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">drift between the various sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">why because they&#39;re spending a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:28.480" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">right basically trying to get they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.480" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">doing this mutual modeling i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of inside your</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">that inner space so you say well so what</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.880" style="s2">well i want to point out to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:44.079" style="s2">very quickly how synesthetic everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">is so what i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.079" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">is i&#39;m going to i&#39;m going to show a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">okay and what i want everybody to do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">as rapidly as possible i&#39;m going to show</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">a picture</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">i want you to point to the picture that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">is uber and the picture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">kiki okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">go so</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">overwhelmingly like 90 beyond 95 percent</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">concordance</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">people po to the right picture as bubba</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">even though i said booba first</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">and the left picture is kiki and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">and and you go and you go well so what</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">synesthesia what the heck is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">connection between</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">bubba and that picture and people will</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">say things</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">well bubba is kind of round and so is</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">the picture and you go</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">what do you mean bubba&#39;s round although</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:36.240" style="s2">saying kiki is sharp</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s sharp and you go what what</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">okay so all of this is evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">various parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">are mutually modeling each other the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">visual cortex</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.319" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">and the auditory cortex right are</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">mutually modeling each other all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">time and that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">right in terms of the coordination you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">would need</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">for skill performance is that okay so</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:04.480" style="s2">yes notice notice how</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">much this mutual model like think about</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:07.720" style="s2">the bat point seeing how the mutual</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:09.760" style="s2">modeling is actually affording</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.720" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">spectralization and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.760" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">so uh some of the work i&#39;m doing with</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">anderson todd and richard wu and fa</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">unguen</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.599" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">on this model of consciousness right</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">we we try to we revise montague&#39;s idea a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">because you know if my aunt and my uncle</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">never spoke again their models would</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">eventually drift apart</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">right right sure models would eventually</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">drift apart so periodically they do have</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">to come together</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:47.680" style="s2">talk to each other and do any</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">corrections to distortions that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.680" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">to the model right right i guess you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">that at times in couples therapy</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">where people have to come in and really</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">get back in tune with each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:03.520" style="s2">now you can actually see human beings</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">um shifting between these two modes you</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.520" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">right so let&#39;s take it that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">i have my my like</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">my modules right and when i&#39;m task</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">focused</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">they&#39;re just working they&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">the world and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">my right and they&#39;re and one area of my</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">brain is relying on its model</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">of another area and vice versa so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">they can be highly coordinated together</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">okay but then there must be a period</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">where they have to stop doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">go back</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">and talk to each other and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">that they are properly</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">modeling each other so that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">integration isn&#39;t infected with</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">distortion</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">well what would that look like well that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">would look like what happens to human</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">they cycle between being task focused</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">and mind wandering</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">right in fact right you&#39;re so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">focused and then your mind goes off</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">and in that it&#39;s and we know you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">you get the default mode network is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">highly engaged</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">and what&#39;s it doing there it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.119" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">self-referential it deals with</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">information that&#39;s self</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">relevant and what do we know from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">work of celie and humphreys that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">self-relevant information is the glue</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">it&#39;s how you glue things together</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">what does that mean practically it means</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">that i make sure that my models</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">are properly tracking each other so that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">they can properly coordinate behavior</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">so you actually cycle in this way all</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">the time that&#39;s indicative</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">of something like this mutual modeling</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">centrally going on in your cognition at</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">many levels</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">now of course you can&#39;t just have mutual</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">model of everything because that would</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">be commentary explosive</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">come back to that issue later so</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">what i want to propose to you is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:48.720" style="s2">require recursive mutual modeling so</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">like uh you know why recursive well</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.720" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">my finger have to be mutually modeled</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">my my little finger and then there has</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">to be mutual modeling between my fingers</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">and then between my fingers and my palm</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">between my fingers and my palm and my</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">thumb</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">and between my hand and my wrist right</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">and my hand and my wrist and my elbow</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">etc that&#39;s what i mean by recursive</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">modeling</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">is that okay all right would that be</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">also sort of the nested hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">modeling like</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:19.359" style="s2">totally totally very much and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">yeah i i know what you you you can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.359" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">with that so i could</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you&#39;re gonna do interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">stuff with it but so ultimately there</p>

<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">that allows us to ask specialized things</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">if you accept that functionality it</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:52.400" style="s2">gives you so</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">much of the phenomenology it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.400" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">adverbial qualia it gives you the sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">of fittedness</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">it gives you the sense of what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">to be here now it gives you the</p>

<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:13.200" style="s2">so let me see if i can piece this</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">together a little bit in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.200" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">uh just the frame of the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">into the participatory and the dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">direct thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">uh so let me let me share with you sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">a less developed model but one that i</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">found very</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:37.200" style="s2">useful in the clinic room right uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">to see if this tracks some with some of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.200" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">sort of what i would call intuitive</p>

<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">but therefore i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">uh dynamic relations that people would</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">in their sequences of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">okay um and so when i i developed the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">thing called the p</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">m e relation okay where p stands for</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">right and that&#39;s going to head into</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">all right m stands for motivation</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">okay which has two different states of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">and avoidance okay and then e stands for</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">emotion which is to energize motive in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">enter you know so so we see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">uh for example is individuals perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">a particular event</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">referencing it in relationship to their</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">goals okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">getting emotion and then responding</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">accordingly as they try to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">regulate the costs and benefits or</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.319" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">stressors and affordances</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:42.079" style="s2">in a dynamic iterative pattern right</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.079" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">right so when i hear your participatory</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">knowing and think about the grip</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">of the agent arena relation and i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:52.960" style="s2">about the components of that as to how</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">is perceiving where it is thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">where it&#39;s trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">enacting particular affordances to</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">extract uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:03.599" style="s2">those patterns of investments i see i</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:06.799" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.599" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">a lot of similarity in that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.799" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">relation so let me let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">ask questions to make sure i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">the same connection as you are so i i</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">expect that when you are working with</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">in a therapeutic context when you say</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:24.000" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">you don&#39;t mean like just literal</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">perception you mean some you mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">something like how they&#39;ve aspectualized</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">what aspect of the thing how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">determining how it&#39;s salient and</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">relevant to them</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">right and then of course that is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a perspectival knowing so i agree</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">with you there are we are we in sync</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">we&#39;re in safe there and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">but that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">that is grounded in ultimately the sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">of identity that they&#39;re assuming</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">in connection with them how they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">the agent arena participate</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">the participation and the affordances</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">that are available</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">but also the influences that become</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:58:00.160" style="s2">unavailable in particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">so there could be ways i&#39;m thinking also</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.160" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">of your sort of filters</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">there could be ways in which people</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">greg i&#39;m not as well versus you so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">going to probably use this in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">way so</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">be charitable with me but there&#39;s ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">in which people could repress</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">they could repress at a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">level because they could</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">refuse to bend on an identity and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">therefore not have access to affordances</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:24.480" style="s2">they could also repress at a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:26.799" style="s2">perspectival level</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.480" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">because they could be fixated on one</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.799" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">aspect</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">and not be able to pick up alternative</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">aspects is that is that 100</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">yeah absolutely absolutely so we can put</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">this let&#39;s put this in on and sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:44.319" style="s2">um so here let&#39;s see if this flies okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">in terms of the kind of both the models</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.319" end="00:58:47.520" style="s2">that people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">so they&#39;re perspectival then will dot</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">dump into their</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">both identity and memory structures okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">so let&#39;s pull on</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">that kind of narrative um there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">if we get into the person level</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:01.040" style="s2">self-conscious justification</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">okay um but this may maybe just because</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.040" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">this resonates with me as a high school</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:05.760" style="s2">kid</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:06.480" style="s2">um i always liked this example my uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.760" end="00:59:09.200" style="s2">when i was</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.480" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">so he was like he helped me see this</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.200" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">dynamic relation</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">as follows so let&#39;s say you&#39;re in a uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">you know a place and you see an</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">attractive person</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">over right right right and so now all of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">a sudden you see the person</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.839" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">all right and then that you&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">perceptual gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">okay then if it&#39;s an attractive person</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">all right and your</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:30.319" style="s2">and your motivational approach state</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.599" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">is to enact that then you want to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:36.799" style="s2">the discrepancy between where you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">and say in this case as a heterosexual</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.799" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">guy where she is</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.000" end="00:59:44.880" style="s2">right right okay um so</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">i might then activate my</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.880" end="00:59:50.319" style="s2">past scripts okay say procedural</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">participatory scripts</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.319" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">of the ways in which that dance might go</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:55.760" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">one of the things then that uh i guess</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.760" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">what i&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">is that i&#39;d like to think a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">more about how motivation</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">and emotion play in this participatory</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">chance</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.000" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">yes very much thank you very much so</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll finish this little narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">because it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">cute for me in that um so our according</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">to him and i think there is good</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:15.280" style="s2">research for this although</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">it is complicated our approach</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.280" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">motivations operate on a slightly</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">different time</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">frame than our avoidance motivation okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:25.119" style="s2">so what he said he what he said he did</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">and i had had a reflection on this as</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.119" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">is that far away from the room when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:30.960" style="s2">see the attractive</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">woman your approach motivation sees the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.960" end="01:00:35.359" style="s2">possibility of success</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">and the stressors of getting rejected</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:38.799" style="s2">are lesser</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">but as you move closer and closer the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.799" end="01:00:43.119" style="s2">time paths cross</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">so the threat of getting rejected then</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.119" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">meets you halfway across the room</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2">which is why you get halfway over there</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">stop and turn back and head back to your</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:53.920" style="s2">bar stool without asking her</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">or out and i had an ability to empathize</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.920" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">with that particular sequence</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">right um and so what what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:05.599" style="s2">is that um uh the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">to me that as we lay down this</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.599" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">participatory dance</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">the dynamic relations inter-psychically</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">between our perceptions our motivations</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">and our emotions</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">with the affordances and costs are</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">engaged in that that&#39;s how i talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:22.079" style="s2">sort of a behavioral investment flow</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:22.880" style="s2">so great so let&#39;s pick up on two sides</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.079" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.880" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">i&#39;m going to quote read montague again</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference between us and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">right uh well we don&#39;t care about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">information we&#39;re processing</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">we care about it and that&#39;s right that</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the fundamental right affective</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">commitment of limited times and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">resources that&#39;s at the core of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:47.040" style="s2">and why do we care about information</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.040" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">because we are auto poetic we are we</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:52.079" style="s2">have to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:53.599" style="s2">care of ourselves because we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.079" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">making ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.599" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">so i think so if we remember that this</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">i&#39;m proposing that this machinery is</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:02.160" style="s2">ultimately all running on the relevance</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:04.319" style="s2">realization machine right</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.160" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">secondly notice how you had different</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.319" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">components</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:10.319" style="s2">and how right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">you can even see that cycle i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.319" end="01:02:13.599" style="s2">talking about right</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:15.839" style="s2">there they&#39;re sort of operating</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.599" end="01:02:18.319" style="s2">independently right the approach</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.839" end="01:02:19.920" style="s2">module and the avoid module and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.319" end="01:02:21.520" style="s2">probably they have they&#39;ve got sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.920" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">mutual modeling going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.520" end="01:02:25.119" style="s2">and then it flips but in between there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">probably a moment where they&#39;re checking</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">in with each other</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">right right that moment of indecision</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">right right well right</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:32.720" style="s2">right and so you can see the mutual</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.400" style="s2">modeling function and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">you can see the mutual modeling function</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.400" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">and you can see the salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">interacting in directly in the example</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">you just gave directly in the example</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">you just gave and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be inherently motivational</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be and therefore it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">going to be inherently aspectual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.920" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">going to be centralized</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be temporal it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">have temporality to it but there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:56.720" style="s2">to be all that what&#39;s it like to be here</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">you now</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.720" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s also it&#39;s going to be relying</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:04.400" style="s2">a mutual modeling between all that</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.400" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">and your sense of who and what you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">and what the arena is</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">the agent arena what are the affordances</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:14.559" style="s2">here um</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">because you will of course it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.559" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">your perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">the actual affordances that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">available to you so</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re at a bar it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">much more likely to hit on a woman</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">than if you&#39;re at a funeral right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">just because the opportunities aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">there for you right using the same way</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:36.720" style="s2">so i i think again we can use this</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">this theoretical machinery you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.720" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">developing to talk about all of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:42.480" style="s2">examples and to cover off</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:44.079" style="s2">a lot of the features that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.480" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">phenomenologically present</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.079" end="01:03:48.079" style="s2">amen yeah yeah that&#39;s so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">certainly what seems so exciting about</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">yeah so i think that you know what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to add</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:58.640" style="s2">to what what do i want to call the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">literature on consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.640" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">with your help you know is these notions</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:09.119" style="s2">of adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:11.119" style="s2">salience landscaping optimal gripping</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.119" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">respectable knowing situational</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.119" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:15.920" style="s2">and participatory knowing and the mutual</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">modeling between perspectival and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s a lot of new machinery that</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:23.680" style="s2">we can use</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.680" end="01:04:27.440" style="s2">machinery is i&#39;m proposing it</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:29.599" style="s2">simultaneously allows us to talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.440" end="01:04:31.280" style="s2">about the function of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.599" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">right and the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">and start to bridge between the function</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">problem and the generation problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:42.319" style="s2">right well and for me where i come at</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.200" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">this you know because i</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.319" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">sort of as we talked about before i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">very frustrated with psychology behavior</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:51.039" style="s2">mental process</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">right right and then it&#39;s like actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.039" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">mental process has a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">neurocognitive functional view</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">of mental behavior and then there is</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:01.760" style="s2">this perspectival</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:03.599" style="s2">uh mind to consciousness deal and there</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:06.000" style="s2">is this narrating</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.599" end="01:05:07.680" style="s2">piece right but now what we can do at</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">least certainly what i feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.680" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">is i can now take mine too with all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">these new conceptual tools</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">right right and create such a much more</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">nuanced relationship to mind one</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">the interface between the various</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">domains right</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">and set up a nice cool little system and</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">then we&#39;ll talk more about how mine</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:25.839" style="s2">three once all this stuff is ready for</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:29.039" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.839" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">loops back and and creates an identity a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.039" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">self-conscious identity or explicit</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:36.240" style="s2">recursive function on top of all this</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">um but it really generates uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.240" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">like jonathan height you know talks</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">um elephant and the writer right right</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">but this is like</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">well what is the machinery of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:47.119" style="s2">elephant right right</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">what&#39;s really driving that elephant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.119" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s paths of affordance</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">and how does it dictate what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">relevant realization processes and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">at what level of uh you know what are</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">the dynamics of that and that to me what</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:05:59.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">is is like oh there&#39;s so much richer</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.760" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">vocabulary</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">for all of that well that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:05.760" style="s2">exciting uh for me</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:07.599" style="s2">in the confluence between my work and</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.760" end="01:06:10.079" style="s2">your work because</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.599" end="01:06:11.680" style="s2">you keep making the case to me in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.079" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">convincing manner by the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.680" end="01:06:17.599" style="s2">um that at least</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:18.240" style="s2">this this this sorry this sorry turn it</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.599" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">the other way right</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.240" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">this work can at least contribute uh to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">enhancing and enriching</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2">the descriptive metaphysics that you see</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:28.000" style="s2">that is missing and generating what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:30.640" style="s2">call the problem in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.000" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">and i agree with you that these problems</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">the hard problem of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:36.640" style="s2">that what maybe we could also call the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:39.359" style="s2">heart problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.640" end="01:06:40.720" style="s2">right they they have to be addressed in</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.359" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">an integrated fashion</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.720" end="01:06:44.799" style="s2">and if you feel right and you keep</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:48.799" style="s2">making these connections to</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.799" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">uh to um to argue for it and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.799" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">if you are concluding more than just</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">feeling uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">that this argument also in a coordinated</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:59.200" style="s2">fashion can help to advance</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">the overcoming of the heart problem of</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.200" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">then that&#39;s fantastic that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s totally fantastic here</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">i&#39;ll give actually i just got this book</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a good book it&#39;s by uh bruce</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:12.640" style="s2">goldstein it&#39;s called the mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.440" end="01:07:14.319" style="s2">okay i read it you know it&#39;s but what it</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.640" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">is if you lead it through our lens i</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.319" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">would argue is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just basically mind one it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">neurocognitive functional view of mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:24.960" style="s2">it gives a chapter on the curiosities of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.880" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">consciousness and then it ends with well</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.960" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a hard problem and science doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">really look at it</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:30.799" style="s2">and then the rest of the book is on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">hidden mind which is basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.799" end="01:07:34.960" style="s2">the underlying information processing</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">and computation neurocognition</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.960" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like okay it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">backstage machinery</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">but it basically and and it emphasizes</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">prediction and how it pulls out</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">particular relevance so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">but so it&#39;s a brilliant neuro or i think</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">a well-done</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:52.640" style="s2">up-to-date neurocognitive analysis okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">but if you were to read that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.640" end="01:07:55.359" style="s2">well but then you have this whole part</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.240" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">of you that actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.359" end="01:08:00.000" style="s2">sees the world yeah right and not to</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:02.160" style="s2">mention a whole another part of you</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.000" end="01:08:03.440" style="s2">actually talks about the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.160" end="01:08:05.039" style="s2">people about the world that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.440" end="01:08:06.559" style="s2">completely dependent upon because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.039" end="01:08:09.520" style="s2">intersubjective</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.559" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">so you get this picture of the mind um</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.520" end="01:08:12.559" style="s2">and this is i think the same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:14.240" style="s2">behaviorist did it&#39;s sort of like well</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.559" end="01:08:15.359" style="s2">to get to the physica you know so</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.240" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">because they&#39;re embedded in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.359" end="01:08:19.839" style="s2">physicality reductionist view</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:21.199" style="s2">and because of the epistemology of</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.839" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">science it</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.199" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">it claps with one hand when we get into</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:26.960" style="s2">interior pistol</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">interior epistemological consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.960" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">um but that&#39;s essentially you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">like well we can&#39;t speculate on</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:35.679" style="s2">unscientific things it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">no we actually have introspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.679" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">awareness there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:40.960" style="s2">ways to angle this</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">and and the scientific you know exterior</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.960" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">epistemology is important in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">but that shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">you know there are ways to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">what we can know from a first person</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:51.199" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.400" end="01:08:52.799" style="s2">um so to me yeah this is so much of an</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:54.799" style="s2">opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:56.159" style="s2">enrich in the picture and of course if</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.799" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">we think about the larger scheme of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.159" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">meaning crisis and how to help people</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">live their lives and what i do in</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">psychotherapy i mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">obviously we&#39;re going to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:05.520" style="s2">subjectivity in the real world oh yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.400" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">was going to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">that that book on the mind leaves you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">with a picture of the mind that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:13.040" style="s2">completely existentially irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">it leaves out the first person</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.040" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">perspective and it leaves out</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">what you call mind three which is you</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">know your personhood</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">right and uh that k</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">i mean this sounds like whitehead but</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:28.080" style="s2">you know that can&#39;t be an enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">that can&#39;t be an adequate account in</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.080" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">fact it seems to leave out</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">most of what we consider existentially</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">morally politically legally important</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">uh well i was going to say having a mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">but a better way of being a mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">being exactly and if we just knew okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">yes here&#39;s mind one</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:49.040" style="s2">and you know and then like i i i talk a</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:51.679" style="s2">little bit in my book</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.040" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">we talk about mind one a and mine one b</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.239" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">transition into behavior like and we</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">give good examples that like stephen</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:09:58.800" style="s2">hawking so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:00.239" style="s2">motor neuron disorder and boom you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.800" end="01:10:01.760" style="s2">that system but</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.239" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">if we have the right vocabulary then we</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.760" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">can read that help people position it</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:08.080" style="s2">and get all the good knowledge but not</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">think that&#39;s the whole picture that to</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.080" end="01:10:10.560" style="s2">me is what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:12.640" style="s2">frustrating about our fragmented</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.560" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">psychology and yeah if we can help</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.640" end="01:10:15.840" style="s2">uh bring psychology and cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">science together and say actually yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.840" end="01:10:19.840" style="s2">we have the edges of this problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">relatively well defined in a conciliate</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.840" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">coherent way</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">i think the utility of that is enormous</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.320" end="01:10:26.800" style="s2">yeah i think so too and i think what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.920" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">said about</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.800" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">um you know this this is a view of</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:32.320" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:34.159" style="s2">that has the potential uh to help</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.320" end="01:10:37.679" style="s2">ameliorate the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.159" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">um i i yeah to me that&#39;s that for me</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.679" end="01:10:40.640" style="s2">would be at the ultimate value</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:42.719" style="s2">of what we&#39;re trying to do here</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.640" end="01:10:44.320" style="s2">obviously to uh if that&#39;s the beauty of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.719" end="01:10:45.900" style="s2">your phraseology is like well</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.320" end="01:10:48.239" style="s2">we need to realize what&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.900" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.239" end="01:10:52.480" style="s2">yeah right well that was the argument i</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">wanted to make today</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.480" end="01:10:55.840" style="s2">and uh i i&#39;m sorry it was a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">more monologic</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.840" end="01:11:01.840" style="s2">but you were there it was helpful and um</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:03.760" style="s2">like i said i don&#39;t intend to do this</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.840" end="01:11:05.760" style="s2">again but there was things i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">sort of show</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.760" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">this part needed to be sort of it was a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">lot that needed to be laid out in a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:11.920" style="s2">linear fashion</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:14.000" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve made the jump from</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:15.600" style="s2">perspectival into participatory i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.000" end="01:11:18.080" style="s2">the optimal grip is clear</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.600" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">i think you know this was a key element</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.080" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">and the whole rover thing is such a cool</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">story anyway</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:24.159" style="s2">so yeah i enjoyed it hearing that uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:26.480" style="s2">deeply and it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:27.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s impactful in terms of oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.480" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">yeah i do that with tetris</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.880" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">so um i propose that we&#39;ll start turning</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:38.880" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:40.800" style="s2">some of the existing theories about uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.880" end="01:11:44.000" style="s2">consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.800" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">um and putting what we&#39;ve built together</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.000" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">into a deep dialogue uh hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:50.480" style="s2">mutually transformative</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:51.040" style="s2">uh with those existing theories so if i</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.480" end="01:11:54.239" style="s2">wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.040" end="01:11:54.880" style="s2">uh as always thank you my friend this is</p>
