<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">akarima cynthia clayton karima always</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">good to hear from you and thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">the comments you put on the videos</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">um should we read the next two chapters</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">i recommend not</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">i recommend re-reading and studying</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">um the chapters that are uh setting up</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">the basic practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">like the self-examination uh what what</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">philosophy in this context what i what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">tend to call philia sophia</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">and especially um all of this the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">materials surrounding epicureanism so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">really sink into it</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">um so try to go quite intense</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">lean deep into it reviewing it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">studying it</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">doing the practices we&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">a little bit faster than mcclellan</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">recommends he recommends you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">as a nine month course we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">a little bit faster than that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">but i do recommend we we stick with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">know at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:14.240" style="s2">um we stick to epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">for at least a couple of weeks and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.240" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll move into stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably be there a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.120" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">longer and the neoplatonism will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">even longer because of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">in that manner next is dimitar</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned trying tdcs and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">meditation have you also tried being in</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">a sense you get prevention tank and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">is there any research on the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">set to deprivation tanks</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">meditation uh no i have not done that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">um my mineers actually prevents me from</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">using something like a sensory</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">deprivation</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">tank my good friend and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">anderson todd is very interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">and he might be someone to contact</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">whether or not there is information and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">on the integration of sensory</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">deprivation tanks and meditation you</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t of course you couldn&#39;t it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">expensive i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t want to make it a regular</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.520" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">the practice it&#39;s going to get dependent</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">on that etc</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">but it might be something that gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">incorporated into a powerful ritual</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.559" style="s2">as a way of bringing about a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">significant</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.559" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">state of consciousness that could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">into the aspiration to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i recommend there i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">know very much</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">um so i recommend</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">if you can his name is anderson todd</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">he&#39;s done talks with me and voices</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">for making is his own channel uh opening</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">up soon i believe it&#39;s called opus</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">and neoplatonism is university and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">we are going to add on significantly uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">to epicureanism within stoicism for how</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">within tai chi chuan so i think that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">how the body remembers trauma um</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">and so that is not something you should</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">so last question is unnamed hi john how</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">would you combine meditating on symbols</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">virtue with the memory palace technique</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">and lectio divina</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">for important writings on them um</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">hold off on answering that question</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">because that is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">into central prominence when we get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">the grove when we&#39;re doing neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">and when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">theergia when we&#39;re talking about theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">just so we&#39;re definitely going to come</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:56.000" style="s2">to that and the kinds of practices</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.000" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">important connections to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">um aspects of jung</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">and corban and um people like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">um so you might want to take a look at</p>
