<p begin="00:01:03.199" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">and there is no priority given to early</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">nominations so you have plenty of time</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">give us two but if you want to nominate</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">two people</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">maybe even a a ticket that you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">would be good you can go to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">website and you can tell us who they</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">you will be able to tell us whether you</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">think that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">are on the left or the right though</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">those are just simply indications of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">perspective those are not binding</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">uh we will soon that is to say in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">early part of this upcoming week we will</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">a platform on which we will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">uh have debate over the merits of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">various</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">nominees that have been advanced</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">we will go through the list to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">that candidates match</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">all of the characteristics that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">and ultimately we are working towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">a narrowing of the field to all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">viable candidates and we will hold</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">a vote likely with ranked choice voting</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.800" style="s2">since we are strong supporters</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">of that mechanism and have candidates</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">by the beginning of september</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">uh let&#39;s see anything else that we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">to say yes so the nominations will</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">remain</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">all right all right so there are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">number of things we wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">today besides that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">um one of the things is that you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">to explain why you predicted that biden</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">would not make the nomination</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">of democrats we also have some stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">talk about with regard to kovid</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">sunlight compelled speech a number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">other issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">emerging but do you want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">uh discussing your prediction</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">that the democrats would drop biden as</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">their candidate yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">and i can tell you right now if you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">thinking about making such an</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">unlikely prediction be prepared for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">lot of pushback of people who feel very</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">clever for telling you that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">that is so</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">unlikely to happen is very unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">happen which i already knew</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">um but in any case i what i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">get at is the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">are facing an unprecedented situation</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">where i believe both major party</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">candidates are showing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">significant signs of mental decline</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">looks like uh the standard kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">confusion that old people sometimes face</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">but i don&#39;t believe we have a precedent</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">a major party candidate suffering</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">decline that appears to compromise them</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">with respect to the very role for which</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">they have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">nominated at least not in such an</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">extreme form</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">and so we are seeing lots of uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">hints of you know we saw a trial balloon</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">floated in the new york times about</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">getting rid of the debates um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">we have seen that joe biden will not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">accepting the nomination in person</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">and i would say maybe there are examples</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">i&#39;m unaware of but i cannot</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">recall the last um</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">the last incident in which joe biden has</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">shown up</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">on a live interview or in person to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">deliver a speech where there was not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">a major gaffe that appeared to be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">result of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">cognitive decline now the gop has</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">released a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">uh a campaign ad that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">uh of course it will be the least</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">generous interpretation possible but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">they released a campaign ad that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.280" end="00:05:23.759" style="s2">compares</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">joe biden of 2008 with joe biden 2020</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">and it does appear quite a stark</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">comparison so</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">what i&#39;m getting at is this i believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">there is awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">inside the democratic party that joe</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">biden</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">cannot be president and probably cannot</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">through something like a debate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">would reveal the extent</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">of his mental decline and whatever plan</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">for keeping him out of the public eye</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">after the other and so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">question about what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">makes sense for them to do and of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">joe biden bowing out of the race which</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">would probably be very much i should say</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">i take no pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">in pointing out the man&#39;s mental decline</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">as much as i&#39;m not a fan of him</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">it&#39;s very sad to see somebody in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">is just incapable of even looking out</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">he deserves a better final act yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">mean i</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to say deserves but i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">just say there&#39;s no i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">really you know he&#39;s no one is no one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">suggesting that the man is evil</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">i think every honorable human being</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">deserves an honorable final act and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">this isn&#39;t that this isn&#39;t that but in</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">we have a different problem our problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">is not joe biden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">well-being or his uh emotional state our</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">problem is how to get the country</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">governed so that we can be safe and move</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">in the right direction and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">um that&#39;s not occurring here so i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">just point out one thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">is that those of us who are focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">what appears to be an incompetent person</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">running on a major party</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">ticket take a lot of flack for not</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.720" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">getting in line because</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">people who tell us this are laser</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">focused on getting trump out of office</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the only thing that they can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">and i would just point out that as with</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">2016</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">the only interpretation here is that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">fact that we have a candidate who does</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">not appear</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">capable of winning by virtue of his</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">obvious</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">competence to do the job and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">desirability to be in the office</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the fault of the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">now you can blame it on</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">democratic voters who nominated somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">who is incompetent or you can blame it</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">on the dnc and the skullduggery that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">obviously unfolds around the primaries</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">but one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">in an era where we are told that donald</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">trump is an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">and that he absolutely must be</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">eliminated from office at all costs you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">would expect the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">to have rallied around somebody who was</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">absolutely unimpeachable and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">clearly competent</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">so that there would be no reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">whatsoever that any rational person</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">could vote against them instead they</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">have delivered us</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">a situation in which we have massive</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">cognitive dissonance where people</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">have to put aside the obvious evidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">of his decline</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">in order to vote for him this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">the opposite of what a patriotic party</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">would have done and so as this becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">unavoidable and we&#39;ve had people</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">discussing this for</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">months we&#39;ve had crystal ball</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:33.839" style="s2">and uh sauger and jetty talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">david packard has talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">caitlyn johnstone has talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">many people have been aware</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">of this pattern and have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">the obvious implications that it has so</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">this is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">a new problem this is something the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">democratic party has been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">and the reason for my prediction is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">i believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">the rate of decline is severe enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">that it is almost impossible to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">um winning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">finishing out a four-year term much less</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">being re-elected</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">and back in december he floated the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">that maybe he wasn&#39;t going to run he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">not pledged not to run as far as i</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">but he floated the idea to insiders that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">he would be a one-term</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">president so already there&#39;s awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">that a two-term biden presidency is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">implausible</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">and then i as i said i don&#39;t think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">very likely to make it four years</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">how likely is he to make it two years is</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">the plan for him to be elected and step</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">immediately might the plan be for him to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">be nominated and then step down giving</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">the dnc the ability effectively to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">choose</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">his replacement so all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">are in play so my prediction</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">while i agree it&#39;s pretty unlikely in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">light of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">in light of the way things have played</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">out in the primary</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">is predicated on the fact that i believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">there is a behind behind-the-scenes</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">discussion going on on how to manage</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">this obvious crisis that has emerged</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t have the situation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">biden</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">and trump in a debate where biden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">obvious decline becomes unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">and people vote for trump simply because</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">he seems to be the more competent of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">so how are they going to manage that if</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">they can&#39;t shut down the idea of debates</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">i believe something is going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">in advance of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">that will change the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">narrative dramatically hence my</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">prediction so</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">is it really likely to happen i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">say it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">pretty fascinating if it does but if it</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen i would say there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">a period of time</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">after the nomination and before the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">election in which it could happen which</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">might be the most logical time</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">for a swap to take place and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">there&#39;s the possibility of an election</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">i it&#39;s hard for me to imagine him being</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">elected if he has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">spend time in public</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">campaigning because gaffe after gaffe</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">will emerge but let&#39;s say he was elected</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">the classroom and maybe it shifted a</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">itself hasn&#39;t changed and we would hope</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">look like a bell curve such that more</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">contains some truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.519" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">it is therefore important to track the</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">scientific insight to grow</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">a hypothesis is yours when it predicts</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">something new</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">yes this does fit beautifully and so i</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">would just say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">you know the landscape of hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">prediction um is a complex one</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">i mentioned on the campfire with eric</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">that we had just watched um the big</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">short with our son</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">zach and there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">uncomfortable period in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">that movie where</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">you have a number of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">figured out that the housing market</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">is irrational and destined for collapse</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">and they have bet against it</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">knowing that that&#39;s the the thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">in order to profit from</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">the insight and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">condition remains both</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">incoherent and stable far longer than it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">should have so there&#39;s this very nervous</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">the market remains incoherent yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">there&#39;s some force playing</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">against them in which the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">assets is not dropping</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">even though the constituents of these uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">these synthetic bonds made of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">mortgages so the more mortgages have</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">begun to fail</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">and people have begun defaulting on</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">their on their loans</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">why is the value of these the commodity</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.799" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">not dropping and so anyway this is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">very common thing where</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">it&#39;s just because you&#39;re right about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">something doesn&#39;t mean that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">apparent that you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">so in this case of this maybe nor does</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">it necessarily become even if it will</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">become apparent as in this case you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a movie about it in part</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">because the entire world ultimately saw</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">that they were right</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">but there&#39;s almost always an</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">intermediate period when</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">um even though there should be dawning</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">realization either in the data or in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">hearts and minds of people observing the</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">prediction was accurate there is a lag</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">yeah and during that lag people will</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">point at you and say aha</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">see you&#39;re wrong and uh there&#39;s a famous</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">quote here</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">i am a little nervous that i&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">wrong person and if so it will be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">ironic but it may be greenspan</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">who said something like um the market</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">can stay</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">irrational longer than you can stay</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">solvent so even though you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">you may end up getting wiped out by your</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">correct belief because you can&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">long enough to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">payoff so all i would say is i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">from a model</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on inside the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">democratic party that model isn&#39;t wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">just because this prediction turns out</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">to be wrong which it likely will</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">that model is right if somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">between uh now and the two-year mark of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">a biden presidency</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">he steps down or is forced to step aside</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">and something else moves into play now</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">there are ways that that could happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">so just to be clear you&#39;re making a few</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">particular predictions</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">and obviously what the one prediction</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">that they will pull him before he</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">becomes the nominee</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">is not borne out if he pull if he wins</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">the election</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">and pulls out within two years the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">broader model</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">which has several sometimes mutually</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">incompatible predictions associated with</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">is that he is not a legitimate contender</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">presidency um yeah so what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">is you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">levels of unlikeliness and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">prediction that i delivered here is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">most unlikely and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">the sort of most aggressive version of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">the model will turn out to be wrong if</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">that prediction isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">but the general model that there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">awareness inside the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">that uh biden&#39;s purpose is to uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">to put something in office other than</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">trump but that his purpose is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">and that there is awareness that he uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">does not have the mental capacity left</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">to function as president um that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">overarching model</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">of which i think uh that is not a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">risky</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">um prediction i find it very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">imagine he would go two years and if he</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">it would be the result of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">they figured out some mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">for piping stuff into his ear so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">there was no risk of him going off</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">script but</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">you know the fact is he can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">through even a</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">there&#39;s any mechanism that will do it</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:23.250" style="s2">all right uh shall we switch yes</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">they do contract it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s obviously a question</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">of why that might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a step back and find some</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">some other things that we now understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">to be true</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">poor air quality is understood</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">to correlate with</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">increased contraction and worse outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">of kovid</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">so here is a july 28</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">the water in this desolate former</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">vacation destination is rapidly drying</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">salinating the lake and releasing</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">decades-old contaminants into the air</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole lot that we could say</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">about what the sultan sea is you know it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">was originally a desert flat that got</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">formed by accident when</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">the colorado river got dumped a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">bunch of water got dumped there</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">and it became briefly this vacation</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">destination</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">but then something about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">another water move</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">a lot of water being moved to san diego</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">i think basically began desalinating</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">or rather salinating the lake by</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">decreasing the water levels in the lake</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">so that you have these towns</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">with names like oasis and mecca where</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">really no vacationers any longer visit</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">or or live there</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">and of course what you have are um a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">of latinos who are often farm workers</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">migrant farm workers often not um who</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">live there because</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">housing is cheap because it sucks to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">live there right and so what we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">is a finding that latinos living near</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">the salton sea</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:31.280" style="s2">have higher rates of covid um and have</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">worse outcomes when they get covered</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">um but we what we really have here is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">as a class issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">right that uh you know i predict that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">anyone who is living in the salton sea</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">is going to have these higher rates of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">asthma and prolonged respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">problems and that when a respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">virus shows up</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">of course they&#39;re going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">susceptible to it as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">similarly we have high population</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">density</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">being a predictor of bad outcomes in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">covid so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">zach you want to put this up just</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">briefly a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">badly dud article in willamette week out</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">of portland</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">most overcrowded in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">headline is better than the article</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">because the article actually really</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">consistently conflates</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">race and class and and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t grant that actually both of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">those things are correlated with</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">um overcrowding so except in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">high density urban centers where living</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">in a high rise is actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">sometimes an indicator of wealth we know</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">that being in overcrowded housing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">is correlated with class and because of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">historical</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">racism maybe modern racism but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">due to historical racism which</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">apparently irritates the cat no end</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">um as it should it should um we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">uh people who have been um</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">oppressed in the historically oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">populations who are lit who are more</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">likely to be living in high</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">population density um housing and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">we have you know how how is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">can tease apart race and class</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">we have a result uh that people of color</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">are more likely to be getting coveted</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">and suffering worse when they do but is</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">it true</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">that that is true even when you control</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">for class i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t know and then finally we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">factory work</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">factory work uh which of course brings</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">with both high population density when</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in factories and low air quality</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">obviously is a correlate for class</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">here&#39;s a story from the guardian on july</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">11th</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">oops la basque factories shut down as</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">hundreds of workers get sick now this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">obviously brings in the additional</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">of now masks aren&#39;t being made because</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s mask factories that are being shut</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">but the the point is that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">number of these things pointing in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">same direction</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">right that class um seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">a uh a predictor</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">of uh sorry for those</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">listening and not watching there&#39;s a cat</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">um class is certainly a predictor</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">of bad outcomes for kovid uh but is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">is race separately from class i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s true and i</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure so one more thing brett</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">and uh and well well that did they that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">they had worse outcomes than than white</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">and this one this report i believe does</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">not attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">tease out whether or not that was true</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">if you would control for class as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">um i would just point out that there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">ways actually that what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ve said elsewhere i won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">it here but</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">the term race is a problem because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.039" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">it is a fiction but it is not entirely a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">fiction it is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">social fiction built around something</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">that we might call population or lineage</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">and um that those things are real</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">biological phenomena whereas race is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">polluted by politics</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">but in any case there are ways i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">that warrants</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">saying again i mean this is just</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">incredibly important population is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">concept that yes all populations pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.840" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">much will have fuzzy boundaries both</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:51.600" style="s2">temporally and spatially but that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make them</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.600" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">not real whereas race is like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">politicization the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">politization is the situation it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">of yeah and maybe it was from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">beginning and maybe it wasn&#39;t i&#39;m not i</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">um but it is it appears to be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">context-free ideology-free description</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">of populations but it of course is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">it is not and you can tell that because</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">um you know a one-drop</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">rule is obviously a political phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">not a biological phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">yeah but i would there&#39;s one fly on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">ointment here which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">what drives people to weaponize it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:28.880" style="s2">a kind of racism to which humans are</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">prone</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">yeah and so it is your genes trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">get you to advance their</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:36.320" style="s2">interests you know against the values</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">most of us would hold that causes things</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">like a one-drop rule to emerge and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">can talk about the biological basis for</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">another time but it&#39;s a complex story</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">race is simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">a fiction it is a bastardization of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">something biological</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">it is itself not a biological</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">description but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">the warping the distortion is driven</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">by a biological motivation that is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">to which we should be responding and um</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">figuring out how to prevent it from</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:09.279" style="s2">having hegemony but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">i would just point out there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">that race can play into this that has</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">everything to do with actual population</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">of origin</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">yes and nothing to do with racism</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">and i would just say that that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:23.679" style="s2">with the fact that vitamin d has</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">consistently shown up</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.679" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">so we&#39;ll get as we&#39;re going there okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">well no i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">all i would say is the simple</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">so the reason that some people have dark</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">skin</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">is because their ancestors come from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">place where the sun comes in through the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">more directly the closer you are to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">equator the more directly the sun comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">through the atmosphere the less of it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">absorbed on the way down</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">the sun&#39;s rays hit the earth more</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">perpendicularly and so go through less</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">atmosphere to get to the earth and so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">is it you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">you you you get more of it and for you</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">standing in any one place get</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">more of it standing there per hour or</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">per year or whatever and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">uv light as we&#39;re about to discuss is</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">extremely destructive stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">and so melanin is built-in sunscreen</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">rather than sunscreen that you either</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">wear or slather on</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">it is sunscreen that&#39;s built into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">skin and of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:16.880" style="s2">people who tan i&#39;ve never been very good</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">at it but people who tan</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.880" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">are you know ratcheting up in time their</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:24.320" style="s2">production of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">this molecule to shield their their</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">basically feel their dna from the damage</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">that comes from uv light</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">but in any case that shield whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a jacket or whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">melanin in your skin</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">interrupts the production of vitamin d</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">which is photosynthetically created in</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">our skin</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">in response to sunlight and so vitamin d</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">for whatever reason has shown up as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">primary factor you will you are less</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">likely to get sick</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">and you are if you do get sick you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">likely to get much less sick</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">if you have proper levels of vitamin d</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:57.519" style="s2">rather than are deficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">and so that can interact in just a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.519" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">physiological way with different</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">populations the prediction of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">of that being that populations will</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">suffer in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">uh in proportion</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">to the degree of darkness of their skin</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">even individuals might be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">you could see this pattern within</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">individuals darker people um</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">might be more affected so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">a non that has nothing to do with racism</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">right but it has to do with has to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">with race but not with racism</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">and then this these findings that seem</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">to have to very much to do with class</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">um class correlates with race 100</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">due to historical racism but is it due</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.240" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">to modern racism</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">that is actually a hypothesis that needs</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">to be demonstrated right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">and and um and no one appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">testing it we are all expected to simply</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">accept it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">well and i would just point out that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">this is you know i don&#39;t know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">going to get to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">what two plus two might equal but um the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">this is the tragic irony of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">um desire to unhook all of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">structures that we have built and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">discovered to evaluate what might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">the claim that these things are all</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">weaponized and therefore none of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">are trustworthy as preposterous what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">want in this circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">is something called an anova you want an</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">analysis that tells you what</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">fraction of the difference in</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">susceptibility to covid or the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">symptoms that you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">is due to class what if you control for</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">class what fraction of it is due to race</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">if you control for those things what</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">fraction of it is due to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">the darkness of your skin what fraction</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">of it is due to zip code</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">so the point is all of these things have</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">a contribution</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">that can be discovered you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">perfectly but we have the tools the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">bigger the sample</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">the better the tools work and we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">figure out how much of these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">are due to x y z factor</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">and ultimately there will be a factor</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">that has to do with modern racism is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.039" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:58.559" style="s2">factor small factor we can predict but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">should we be trying to reduce modern</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.559" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">racism to zero of course of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">right all right all right um</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:09.279" style="s2">so um i can move into the the sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">and uv thing now unless you had other</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.279" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">things you want to talk about with</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">regard to cove at first</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">um no we can we can come back to them</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">all right so um a super chat question</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">that we got</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">in episode 36 that we did not get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">this article zach if you want to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">this up</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">so i think i think the person who asked</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">who pointed us to this this is a 2020</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">article from</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">june far uvc light 222 nanometers</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">efficiently and safely inactivates</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">airborne human coronaviruses</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">so give me my screen back if you will</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">zach thank you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">um i quote from the abstract uh that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">uh far ubc light and the 207 to 222</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">nanometer</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">range efficiently kills pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">potentially without harm</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">potentially without harm to exposed</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">human tissues</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">so the authors here have tested against</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">two coronaviruses although not sars cove</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">yet and found high efficacy against</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">those coronaviruses as well as in</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">previous work against influenza</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">so they basically had already they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">already primed and ready to look and see</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">if this far</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">uv light would be um deactivating</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">viruses because they had previously done</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">this work to test whether it would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">against influenza and so in</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">in both of the papers that um that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">found</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">that they that they are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">here um they find that it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">so wait a question yeah um the structure</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">of this claim</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">that this particular wavelength of uv</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">um destroys the pathogen without damage</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">to tissue</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">they&#39;re not talking about using this</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">in or on the tissue but the question is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">about using the light</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">um as a disinfectant in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">and that a person in that environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">would be unharmed so</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">whereas some wavelengths of light you</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">could potentially cause skin cancers for</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">example if you had</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.599" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">enough of it um in this case what</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ve actually talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">right i argued in one</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">prior live stream that um that we could</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">envision</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">light bulbs that would disinfect a room</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">when nobody was present</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that&#39;s the super chat</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">question was in response to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">and this is exactly what these guys are</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">are saying we should be doing but</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">apparently saying you don&#39;t have to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">light bulbs that know when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">room and disinfect when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">that you could disinfect a room without</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">hurting the people in it</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">using this particular wave so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">actually the where</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">uh what i&#39;m looking at right now they</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">say the most commonly employed type of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">uv light for germicidal applications is</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">a low pressure mercury vapor arc lamp</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">emitting around 254 nanometers more</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">recently xenon lamp technology has been</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">used which emits broad uv spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">however while these lamps can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">disinfect unoccupied spaces</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">direct exposure to conventional</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">germicidal uv lamps in occupied public</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">spaces is not possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">because direct exposure to these</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">germicidal lamp wavelengths can be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">health hazard both to the skin and eye</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">by contrast</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">um we see we there is no evidence yet</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">um that in the range they are finding</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">efficacy against coronaviruses in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">207 to 222 nanometer range</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">that they are uh damaging to human</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">tissue so</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">they they may well have found the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">spot here and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing so um i have a bunch more</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">to say here but you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">comment um i want to add one thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">that lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">where we have a legacy device like our</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">lights</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">could be upgraded for this purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">there&#39;s another place where i see this</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">we have hvac systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">that recirculate air and they do it for</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">a good reason which is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">you know if you took outside air for</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">example then in the winter</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">you would have to heat it up from a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">low temperature rather than taking air</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">which is cooled in a room reheating it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">you&#39;re eating it a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">very small amount so efficiency wise</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">this is important</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">there are however times when you might</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">um adjust your hvac system so that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">was circulating air the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">your car system circulates air</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">so that yeah well i mean in a car we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">all familiar with you can choose whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">or not you&#39;re breaking in outside air or</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">recirculating</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">exactly but my point is there are times</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not a huge fan of air conditioning i</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">happen to think it creates a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">huge amount of ill health but</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">if you&#39;re not cooling air or heating it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">you might still want to use the system</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">to circulate outside</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">air in and if you had a net flow through</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">it would decrease the chances of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">at least contracting covet would it work</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">generally with flu and other pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">maybe but in this case wouldn&#39;t it be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">great if you could get your hvac system</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">to work for you rather than against you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">right yeah or early i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">when but one of the first live streams</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">that we did</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">um i was talking about the results uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">that in fact you know opening windows is</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">more effective</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">than running running your hvac but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">may be that there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">uh to to fix the hvac system such that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">they could be effective in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">um that opening windows is effective</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">as basically an anti-viral agent and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">lessening the uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">the bad symptoms of the disease and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">indeed i think if if memory serves</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">during tuberculosis tuberculosis</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">outbreaks around world war one maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">uh that basically taking patients who</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">were infected outside</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">uh increased their survival rates</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">significantly just getting them outside</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">there was air flow and where there was</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">sunlight yeah it&#39;d be interesting enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">vitamin d was a contributor there too</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">yeah um i would just as a final piece</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">it is certainly already possible and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">could greatly enhance the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">hvac systems even when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">recirculating air within a building</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">to physically filter out things like</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">particles which is costly energetically</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">but also to use uv light exactly to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.720" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">disinfect this stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">all of these systems could be could</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">become wise about</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.440" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">absolute infection yeah and and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">should be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">absolutely so um i guess one place i</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">wanted to go with regard to this</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">research um is it&#39;s an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">us once again</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">to talk about the risk of hyper novelty</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">right uh and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">and also to talk about the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">precautionary principle when we modify</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">our ancestral conditions</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">so i was asked at a conference last</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">summer i don&#39;t think i told you about</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">this interaction</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">by this rich young woman who was rather</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">self-satisfied in the way that rich</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">people sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">are what value spending time in nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">could possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">she had heard me talking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">she was affronted by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">the very thought that spending time in</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">um would have value and she said to me i</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this is a direct quote but</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">something like why aren&#39;t the things we</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">learn on screens a complete replacement</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">i made the mistake of generating a list</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">for her on the spot and i said things</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">like well you know we know that stress</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">hormones are lowered when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">and that physical movement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">required at least to get to nature and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">often when you&#39;re in nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:54.480" style="s2">is well understood to be healthy across</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">a number of anatomical and physiological</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.480" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">and the value of facing an environment</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">that is not human-made</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">and so can throw you curveballs um</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:05.359" style="s2">that you have no way of either fully</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">predicting or of negotiating with is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.359" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">huge</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">that is to say and this is a point that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">we make in the book that we&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">and have made many</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">times before but there&#39;s no arguing your</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">way out of a storm front</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">or a river that has risen three feet</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">since the last time you crossed it</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">or the setting sun you can&#39;t watch light</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">levels descend</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">and make a social negotiation with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">descending light levels</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">unless you&#39;re inside right unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">inside but you&#39;re the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">is this non-arbitrary arbitrator</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">of do you actually have a model of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">universe that makes some sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">and um and so you know i said all that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">to her and she was you know mostly not</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">convinced</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">because she was not prepared to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">convinced uh but i actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">realized right in the aftermath and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">again thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">research that the better answer is this</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">the better answer is we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">all of the benefits of spending time</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">outdoors we have some of them and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">this list right</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">and there are many more that we do know</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.359" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">but we do know that we have done so for</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">almost all of our existence and that as</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve been spending less time outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">our health has begun to fail us and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:12.400" style="s2">suggests that there is value there even</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">if we cannot yet point to what all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.400" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">the value is or what the benefits are</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">i&#39;m grateful that there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">are discerning what some of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">benefits are and that we have discerned</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">some of them and are talking about them</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:24.480" style="s2">but i&#39;m also certain that there are more</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s not incumbent on me</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.480" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">defending the ancestral condition to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">come up with the benefits of it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">defend</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">it it&#39;s incumbent upon the new thing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">defend</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">why it can&#39;t possibly be getting in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">so this is this is chesterton&#39;s fence</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">also right when you come upon a fence</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s in your way if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">destroy it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">chesterton uh would would say you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">to tell me what the fence is there for</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">and if you cannot tell me what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">there for i don&#39;t want you getting rid</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">of it because you clearly don&#39;t know its</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">value if you could tell me what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">there for could then make an argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">for its removal</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">maybe we can talk about removing it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">until and unless</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">you can accurately and completely</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">describe what the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">do not get rid of it and you know we in</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">our last</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">super chat q a we fielded a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">about the appendix and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">don&#39;t get rid of the appendix until you</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">have a really good sense of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">there for we actually now</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">after a hundred years of people getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">rid of their appendices i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how you pluralize the organ or</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">i certainly do whether it&#39;s accurate</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">are now coming to an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:33.839" style="s2">what what it&#39;s there for</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">so the default assumption should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.839" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">that it is it is not actually helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">that since we&#39;ve started doing it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">been associated with decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">health right um</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">i guess one more one more thing on this</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">if you want to jump unless you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">jump in right here well i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">you know the problem is we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">are too in love with our analytical</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">abilities which</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">indeed do make us special as creatures</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">sure do</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">um but there is a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">um you can you have an intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">being outside is healthy virtually</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">everyone has this intuition</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s right um and it is likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">something significant i mean just i</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">would point to one example</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">that if you are kitty cat if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">are backpacking and you are suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">exposed to a normal</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">light regime you are liable to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">yourself not</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">so eager to stay up into the wee hours</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">and not so eager to stay in bed</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">after the sun has come up but um</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">it just simply reinforces a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">normal relationship to day and night and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">this sets in so</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">quickly that a discovery that yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">know we have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">you know i&#39;m particularly i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">tracing down all of the little things</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">you know hence the discovery that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">massively allergic to wheat which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">really hard to detect because it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">but um you know the idea that blue</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">lights cause it to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">very difficult to go back to sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">you know yellow lights</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">don&#39;t these sorts of things are patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">you can detect in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">and we all have sleep issues because we</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">are constantly flooded by all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">arbitrary nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">and the fact that all you have to do</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">you know there are very few um novel</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">influences and you&#39;re restored to just a</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">environmental elimination diet</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">no it&#39;s an illumination diet where you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">change the wavelengths that you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">encountering</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s an environmental elimination</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">diet that actually takes out all of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">novel things of modern life</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">with the exception of what you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">brought with you and you can see if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">get healthy i mean the pun is cute but</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">it actually really um</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">really diminishes the point sorry about</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">that as puns do often disrespect</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">um no but i mean i think this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">important i was you know really i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">reframing what i heard you say that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">is this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">environmental elimination diet that has</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">a great value</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s an that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of hybrid answer between</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">the listing that i gave this woman of</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">what the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">are of of being in nature and what i</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">later the more apt answer was you just</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">and because the change has been</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">correlated with a decrease in health you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">should assume that it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">but but but that this allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">actually find out which of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">um might be unhealthy or just oh i went</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">and spent a week</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">out away from all of the usual</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">toxins and influences and screens and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">these five things i didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">were correlated went away</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">okay i still don&#39;t know what all that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">i&#39;m doing in my normal life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">associated with</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">but i could be pretty sure that it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">something that wasn&#39;t out there when i</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">was backpacking</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">right so um</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">we have another this is another benefit</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">of being outdoors right sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">is literally disinfectant it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">disinfectant and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">i think our grandmothers knew this at</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">some level although i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s particularly said it but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">just a side note on that we&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">all heard this you know sunlight is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">best disinfectant but</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">we know when we hear that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">usually invoked metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">and so here we have this perfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">convergence of literal and metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">truths</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">which is not always the case that this</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">sunlight is the best disinfectant</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not sunlight is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">literally the best disinfectant in all</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">cases but</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">uh in in the case of many germs it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">and sunlight is the best disinfectant is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">a metaphorical truth as well and so i</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">just i went down</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">this little tiny little historical road</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">that i found interesting so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">i&#39;d share with</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">with you and and all of you today</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">um this was used first well this was</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">used as a metaphor by lewis brandeis who</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">is a supreme court justice from 1916 to</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">so the complete quotation i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">still a brief quotation but from</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">brandeis is</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">publicity is justly commended as a</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">never hear it and yet i think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something truly deep there</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">around combining</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">the sort of post-industrial landscape</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">and the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">and the virtues of it that we are also</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">finally one more note on this uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">brandeis himself um</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually come up with this uh so</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a quote from an 1888 book by</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">zack if you want to put this up here and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll just um read</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">read this uh public opinion is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">fresh keen and full of sunlight like</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">and the sunlight kills many of those</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">maybe that for now we&#39;ll stop there cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">now um i would just point out that in</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">case of kovid we find both the</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">i mean sunlight being the best</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">disinfectant because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">the literal use here that there is</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">you know uv light disinfects especially</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">with respect to covet</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">for now it&#39;s not to say it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">evolve a protection and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">this goes to the second part which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">the complete lack of transparency</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">surrounding what took place in china and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">allowed this</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">did as a result of bad information and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">whether it possibly escaped</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">from a lab where it had been enhanced</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">research the lack of transparency there</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.599" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">is making this a much more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">there are lots of features as we keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">saying here and it&#39;s getting no traction</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">the possibility that this virus was</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">trained to do what it does in serial</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">passage experiments where it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">selected artificially by putting it into</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">either tissues or creatures or both and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">training it to infect for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">studying it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">the question really is what if that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">what happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">what were the exact conditions of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">because from that list of exact</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">conditions we can expect</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">places where it was drawn into one kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">of structure</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">and it will evolve back in the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">direction over time</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">we may even be seeing this initially</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">this virus had a very hard time</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">infecting children</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">we are now seeing significant damage to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:19.359" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">that could be the result of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.359" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">that we are now detecting a pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">was there all along and we didn&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">or it could be the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">evolving and it is losing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">characteristics that were favored in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">laboratory environment</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">and taking on these other</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:34.880" style="s2">characteristics so</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">this is not an academic question this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.880" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">a practical medical question</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">and we have no transparency right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">we still have this is what journalism</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:45.680" style="s2">and the courts are for</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">and uh we we seem to be lacking</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.680" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">we seem to be getting a highly</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">politicized push across basically every</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">every aspect of the kobe 19 story right</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">and the fact is are</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">our governments should come together</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">over this the point is no matter who is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">at fault and in what way for this having</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">happened we are all in the same boat</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">with respect to figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">what this virus is and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">control it because it could be with us</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">and uh it turns out that it</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">is even if it is less lethal than we</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">once thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been talking about this for</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">weeks it is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">as deadly as we feared it is however</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">apparently much more destructive people</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">who recover</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">are not fully recovered and so zach</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:34.079" style="s2">could you put up</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">um the first of those articles that i</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.079" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">sent you</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">so here we have an article</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">about damage to the brain a large</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">percentage of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">patients 55 have neurological problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">three months later</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">so this article points to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">original research that is illustrating</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">that there are actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:03.040" style="s2">this is very frightening for it to be in</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.040" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">and you know there were hints of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">from the beginning the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">uh the system&#39;s taste and smell for</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">example but that we are seeing patterns</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">where most people who are getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">coronavirus are having</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">neurological symptoms even months later</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:20.319" style="s2">even after they&#39;ve completely</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">as far as we know cleared the virus</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.319" end="00:52:23.119" style="s2">which may mean that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">completely clear it or it may mean that</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.119" end="00:52:26.559" style="s2">the damage done by the virus in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">short period of time that they were sick</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.559" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">is having these long lasting</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:29.920" style="s2">implications and we don&#39;t know how long</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">they last</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.920" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">yeah just um there&#39;s an analogy there</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">as we&#39;ve talked about before the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">organizational versus activation effects</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">of hormones that the virus might have</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">caused damage in an organizational sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">of way</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">back then and such that even if your</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">body has cleared it</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">you never go back to normal just like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">being masculinized with testosterone</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">as uh as a boy an early teenager you</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">will never go back to not having been</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">masculinized by testosterone</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">whereas an activational effect of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">hormone requires that the trigger be on</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">for the for the switch to flip and um we</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">in this case it would be is there still</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2">virus present</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">which is causing the lingering brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">malfunction in which case we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">the the problem is a little bit simpler</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">in that case right and it&#39;s less dire</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">in terms of the future for people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">been infected because well we just need</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:25.599" style="s2">to clear your body of this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">know we don&#39;t know how to do it yet but</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.599" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">once once done it&#39;s it&#39;s good and over</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:31.920" style="s2">as opposed to if it&#39;s more like an</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">organizational effect wow well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.920" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">got damage and you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:35.200" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">and now we need to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.200" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">mitigate that damage but the damage is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">yeah but the problem is if it&#39;s hiding</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">out in neurological tissue</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">there may be no way of getting rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">oh so i mean so in another level so like</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">another analogy with</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">uh like falcipro malaria or no 5x</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">malaria that&#39;ll hide out in your liver</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">so that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no doing anything with it you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t feel particularly sick if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">infected with vivex malaria</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">but it you also there&#39;s no way for</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">medicine um like chloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">to go after it there&#39;s no way for normal</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">medicines there are medicines that will</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:06.400" style="s2">chase it out of your liver in that case</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">but there</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.400" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">are viruses herpes viruses for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">hide in neurological tissue</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:14.079" style="s2">and they effectively retreat to places</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">that the immune system can&#39;t get to them</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.079" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">so um anyway this is part of why</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">for example chickenpox turns into</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:23.359" style="s2">shingles later in life</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">right um so anyway if it&#39;s if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.359" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">hiding out in neurological tissue that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">um uh insulated from the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">that&#39;s very bad news</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s much more incentive for us to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">figure out how not to get this thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">the what was passed for sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">early in this thing which was</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:43.920" style="s2">um if you get it and you have a mild</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">case you&#39;re lucky because you might have</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.920" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">immunity</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re done right and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">well we don&#39;t know if you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">yeah you know we don&#39;t know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">immunity</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">and we do know that there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">chance that you will have had</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">damage to a major system can you put up</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">the other articles zach</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to show you another article</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">here again this is not the primary</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">literature this one talks about a number</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">of different</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">systems and types of damage can you</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">scroll down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">but anyway this one talks a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">the brain fog that people experience but</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">the heart damage and so we are seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">large percentage of people</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">who have had mild cases where we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">actually see the damage to their hearts</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">so this is just</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:34.799" style="s2">a you know yes it&#39;s less deadly than you</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.799" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">yes it&#39;s more destructive than you</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">thought you have to adjust your model</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:40.880" style="s2">accordingly and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s still all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.880" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">that&#39;s up in the air about you know if</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">you get better</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have these symptoms are</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">you really done will it come back</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">later will you contract it again in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">year we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">right so uh one last topic before we</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">some level</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">we have been talking for weeks now</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">months i guess</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">about the the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">that is taking over and making it</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">difficult for people to say things other</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">than what is becoming the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">the dominant accepted truth on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">street um i&#39;ve i&#39;ve been talking about</p>

<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">essay on power of the powerlessness</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember exactly what it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">called do with power his green grocer</p>

<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">is just a reminder of the risk of</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">its utility uh for us</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.359" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">in seeing what yeah at the point that we</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.400" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">some primacy over korea and that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">going to work and so they knew they were</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">battling for it um but you know really</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">to the degree that there was a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">basically people to the east</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">were more likely gravitating japan and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.079" end="00:58:42.319" style="s2">people to the west to china and there</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">could have been</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.319" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">a divide that way but the but the split</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">being put where it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">effectively just cut a um not</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">homogeneous but</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">more homogeneous than many population in</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">and people in south ended up with uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:58:59.680" style="s2">something like a democracy and the</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:14.559" style="s2">so kim il-sung who ruled north korea</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">from its founding in 1948 until his</p>

<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">um uh then</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">after when when he died his son kim</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">jong-il became head of state when he</p>

<p begin="01:00:05.599" end="01:00:09.359" style="s2">as a 21 year old university student</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">junson was naturally skeptical of all</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">including the north korean government he</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:14.319" style="s2">prided himself on his questioning</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t think of himself as</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">seditious or in any way an enemy of the</p>

<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">he believed in communism or at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">believed that whatever its faults it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">a more equitable and humane system than</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">he had imagined he would eventually join</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.480" style="s2">the workers party and dedicate his life</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">to the betterment of the fatherland</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.480" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">that was what was expected of all those</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:35.359" style="s2">who graduated from the top universities</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">now surrounded by sobbing students</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">junsong wondered</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">if everybody else felt such genuine love</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">for kim il-sung and he did not</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:45.119" style="s2">how would he possibly fit in he had been</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">contemplating his own reaction or lack</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.119" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">thereof with an intellectual detachment</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">but suddenly he was gripped with fear</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.079" style="s2">he was alone completely alone in his</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">indifference</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.079" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">he always thought he had close friends</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:56.720" style="s2">at the university but now he realized he</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t know them at all</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.720" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">and certainly they didn&#39;t know him if</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">they did he would be in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">this revelation was quickly followed by</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">another equally momentous</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">his entire future depended on his</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">ability to cry</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">not just his career and his membership</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">in the workers party his very survival</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">was at stake</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">it was a matter of life and death jon</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">song was</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">terrified at first he kept his head down</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">so nobody could see his eyes</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">then he figured out that to be kev&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">eyes open long enough they would burn</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">and tear up</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">it was like a staring contest stare cry</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">stare cry eventually it became</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">mechanical</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">the body took over where the mind left</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:38.160" style="s2">off and suddenly he was really crying</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">he felt himself falling to his knees</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">rocking back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">sobbing just like everyone else nobody</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">would be the wiser</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.760" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">and one more unless you want to comment</p>

<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:31.280" style="s2">and some people who act out of fear will</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">at some point begin to believe</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.280" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">the things that they say out of fear</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">just out of self-preservation</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:39.680" style="s2">are familiar at this point i would say</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:42.240" style="s2">that they&#39;re familiar to us</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.680" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">increasingly these tactics yeah not the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.240" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">outcome</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">we are seeing instinct to it</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:50.000" style="s2">right the degree to which we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">compelled varies based on where you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.000" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">what industry you&#39;re in and all of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">but we are seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:58.000" style="s2">instinct to compel people to feel even a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">particular way about things okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.000" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">we are seeing a rejection of the idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">that you are free to formulate your own</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">opinion about this that or the other and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">here&#39;s i mean i do think there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:10.720" style="s2">philosophical question here which i feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">i know the answer to but</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.720" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">i cannot defend it the question is</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:19.280" style="s2">are we justified um certainly almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">everybody who</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.280" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">will be listening to this podcast will</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">that there is something marvelous about</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:30.319" style="s2">free now i think we have to think</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">carefully about what being free</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.319" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">is because it&#39;s very easy to take</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">freedom and treat it frivolously</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">basically to squander freedom and should</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">we be entitled to</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">my guess is we should be that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:45.119" style="s2">part of freedom but</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.200" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">um at some level the ability</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.119" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">to figure out how in what to invest your</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:50.079" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">right and the values that will cause you</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.079" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">to invest it in some invested in</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:55.359" style="s2">something good</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">rather than to waste it those things to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.359" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">me seem</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:03.520" style="s2">simply superior to a system</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">that sustains life it may even do some</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.520" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.400" style="s2">better than a system in which you are</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">free because freedom involves freedom to</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.400" end="01:05:11.359" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">whereas a system that drives freedom out</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:15.280" style="s2">may be able to guarantee that at least</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:18.559" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t happen to you but</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.280" end="01:05:21.039" style="s2">but in any case we are facing a question</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.559" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">about whether or not you know by what</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.039" end="01:05:25.280" style="s2">standard is</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">the success of a system to be measured</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">are we to be simply horrified by a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">system that compels you to cry in order</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:36.240" style="s2">advertise your um complete mental</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.000" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">alignment with your population</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.240" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">even if that provides some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">stability i think so</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">but but i mean also i guess i would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:48.400" style="s2">the question that you ask is are we to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">be simply horrified as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.400" end="01:05:52.319" style="s2">perhaps the implied alternative was</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">finding something good there</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">but one alternative implied alternative</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">that i heard was</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">or can we learn from it can we learn</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">from it even though</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">uh the outcome is not an outcome that um</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">any reasonable person would want can we</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:11.359" style="s2">learn from</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:12.319" style="s2">the tactics that we saw on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.359" end="01:06:15.440" style="s2">there and say</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.319" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">perhaps perhaps these are indicators of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">a authoritarian movement that&#39;s afoot</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:21.440" style="s2">well i agree that they are i mean and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">nobody who listens to us is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.440" end="01:06:24.839" style="s2">shocked that we both</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">find the authoritarian of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.839" end="01:06:29.119" style="s2">authoritarian-ness of this movement</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.440" end="01:06:30.799" style="s2">the most telling and frightening</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.119" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">hallmark of it</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.799" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">but i think i&#39;m asking something deeper</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">which is that effectively</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:39.599" style="s2">you have a movement that is availing</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:41.599" style="s2">itself of you&#39;re talking about in the us</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.599" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">in the u.s a movement that is availing</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.599" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">itself of the ability</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">to pressure every institution into</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:50.319" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:54.799" style="s2">false things absurd things demanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.319" end="01:06:56.960" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.799" end="01:06:59.440" style="s2">we could draw a line where it violates</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.960" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">the law which it does sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.440" end="01:07:03.359" style="s2">but there&#39;s an awful lot that it does</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">through scaring people</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">below a level where it&#39;s illegal to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.200" end="01:07:09.920" style="s2">so and so on what basis</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:11.599" style="s2">do we claim actually we have the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.920" end="01:07:13.280" style="s2">to halt this process</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:15.440" style="s2">if the process itself does not</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.280" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">inherently violate</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.440" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">the um at least the constraints that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.359" style="s2">lay out</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:26.640" style="s2">at the level of um of</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.359" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">legal limits and i believe fully that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.640" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">have the right to shut this movement</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">down because it is a threat</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">you know we could make the argument and</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">we have made the argument it is a threat</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">to the stability of our system</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">so to the extent that the purpose of our</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:41.119" style="s2">system is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.720" style="s2">provide for people if this in the end</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.119" end="01:07:44.160" style="s2">results in its inability to do that</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.720" end="01:07:44.960" style="s2">that&#39;s one basis on which you might</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.160" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">object to it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.960" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">but there&#39;s also something objectionable</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">about the very fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:52.640" style="s2">that it does not value freedom right and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not one of these people as</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.640" end="01:07:55.280" style="s2">you well know</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:57.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not one of these people who thinks</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">that absolute</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.520" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">freedom that the ability to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">is great i think that the constraints</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">that actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">liberate you meaningfully are extremely</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:08.640" style="s2">useful and actually i think that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:12.000" style="s2">ridiculous discussion we&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.640" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">about basic arithmetic is exactly this</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.000" end="01:08:16.239" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:18.239" style="s2">and the point is you become freer</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.239" end="01:08:19.679" style="s2">when math does not allow you to choose</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.239" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">what the plus symbol means</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.679" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">if we agree on what the plus symbol</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">means that is a reduction in some narrow</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:25.839" style="s2">kind of freedom that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">buys you the ability to make an airplane</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.839" end="01:08:29.600" style="s2">to go somewhere it buys you the ability</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:31.279" style="s2">to have a negotiation with other people</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.600" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">and know what it means to enforce an</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.279" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">these things are liberating and so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:39.120" style="s2">constraint liberates it&#39;s like the fd</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">a rules allow you to eat and not fear</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.120" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be poisoned the faa</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">and fly to wherever so constrains the</p>

<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">well the whole thing is coming apart so</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">at some level i don&#39;t know which acronym</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:55.040" style="s2">is going to be the last acronym standing</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:08:57.520" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:58.480" style="s2">i guess they&#39;re not acronyms they&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.520" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">whatever they are</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.480" end="01:09:03.199" style="s2">but but the question is can</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:04.960" style="s2">must we be horrified on the basis that</p>
