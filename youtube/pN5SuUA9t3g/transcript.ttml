<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:11.690" style="s2">abused and then even though kinds of leo</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:13.970" style="s2">project has been on the back burner just</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.690" end="00:05:15.890" style="s2">for now while Cove in nineteen because</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.970" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">what I was doing I was wanting to create</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.890" end="00:05:20.990" style="s2">an organization called the third place</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:25.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically I wanted to craft pub</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.990" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">because like there&#39;s nowhere to go if</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.070" end="00:05:29.270" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be drinking especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:31.640" style="s2">in Scotland&#39;s usual drinking culture but</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.270" end="00:05:33.560" style="s2">myself there&#39;s no way like all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.640" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">community centers your shelter five so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.560" end="00:05:39.790" style="s2">the idea without this club and it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:43.400" style="s2">like a mash-up between an art department</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.790" end="00:05:46.190" style="s2">and a wonky tea shop with the opening</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.400" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">hours and atmosphere of a pope so people</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.190" end="00:05:50.600" style="s2">could just drop in and have a cup of tea</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:53.060" style="s2">learn how to do stuff and but that&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.600" end="00:05:55.910" style="s2">way in the future and I started off with</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.060" end="00:05:57.590" style="s2">a free room because then we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.910" end="00:05:59.479" style="s2">to people people liked the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.590" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">obviously you don&#39;t have enough money to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.479" end="00:06:06.470" style="s2">buy a box if you want and so basically a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">church give us a three routes or like</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.470" end="00:06:10.430" style="s2">start hosting meet in from now so starts</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:12.290" style="s2">as an arts and crafts drop is where</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.430" end="00:06:13.820" style="s2">anyone can comment doesn&#39;t matter if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.290" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to do arts and crafts</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.820" end="00:06:19.220" style="s2">you can just go for a cup of tea so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:22.540" style="s2">first week we did we add 118 people came</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.220" end="00:06:25.160" style="s2">the second week nine people came and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.540" end="00:06:27.860" style="s2">after that Cove in nineteen and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.160" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">got councils and also I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.860" end="00:06:33.260" style="s2">about doing a website and when with</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.710" end="00:06:35.450" style="s2">green geeks and during the chat</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.260" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">yesterday about helping with a CRM</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.450" end="00:06:40.620" style="s2">system and I decided to bite the bullet</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">and go back and fix things</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.250" end="00:07:04.060" style="s2">that way through your ent eight myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.050" end="00:07:06.090" style="s2">with it because I&#39;ve looked at it for</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.060" end="00:07:08.830" style="s2">years but I know it you know so and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.090" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">yeah so and doesn&#39;t says of coming up</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.830" end="00:07:14.440" style="s2">loads of ideas I realized now do gain be</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:17.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge chasm between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.440" end="00:07:19.870" style="s2">thinkers and the doers and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.560" end="00:07:21.970" style="s2">like I probably come from the land of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.870" end="00:07:23.889" style="s2">doing but nobody guess what I&#39;m on about</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.970" end="00:07:25.690" style="s2">and as I said there&#39;s a huge layer</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.889" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">bridge that leads chasm and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.690" end="00:07:30.370" style="s2">today that I&#39;ve got no fixed ideology</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve got no fixed belief system but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.370" end="00:07:36.550" style="s2">love looking at things and I love</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:38.139" style="s2">looking ideas so in the game be projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.550" end="00:07:40.090" style="s2">I&#39;d like to do a one to one with all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.139" end="00:07:42.460" style="s2">members in there gave me projects to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.090" end="00:07:45.340" style="s2">find out more about what your projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.460" end="00:07:48.840" style="s2">are and maybe do a research project on</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.340" end="00:07:51.639" style="s2">what collaboration tools people use it</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.840" end="00:07:54.789" style="s2">and see if there&#39;s maybe possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.639" end="00:07:56.940" style="s2">that in the future and building</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.789" end="00:07:59.409" style="s2">something or getting something there</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.940" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">because what I find about collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.409" end="00:08:04.060" style="s2">tools is if you you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:07.180" style="s2">start off on an idea and you&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.060" end="00:08:09.099" style="s2">money and the tools are out there</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.180" end="00:08:10.990" style="s2">they&#39;ll make you pay for certain things</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.099" end="00:08:12.669" style="s2">and as soon as you get somebody to come</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:14.740" style="s2">and play out with you you charge you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.669" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">more and more and more well these people</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.740" end="00:08:17.259" style="s2">would come and play out with you they</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:20.440" style="s2">might not stay so you&#39;ll end up paying</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.259" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">for them as well so it just just look to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.440" end="00:08:25.539" style="s2">barriers to it anyway so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">way we can find that maybe get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.539" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">the barriers and that we can all have</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">collaboration tools that we&#39;re then we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:33.250" style="s2">can actually use that&#39;s not gonna cost</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:35.229" style="s2">us the earth and maybe I have a suite up</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.250" end="00:08:37.630" style="s2">them rather than just paying each month</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.229" end="00:08:38.860" style="s2">for different ones I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.630" end="00:08:40.529" style="s2">cool but neither one two long</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:42.849" style="s2">conversations find out your project</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.529" end="00:08:45.310" style="s2">provides what you do in to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.849" end="00:08:47.170" style="s2">collaboration tools and I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.310" end="00:08:49.060" style="s2">synchronicities in between lots of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.170" end="00:08:50.740" style="s2">different people and I like looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.060" end="00:08:53.589" style="s2">things I mean you know can go research</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">project what&#39;s out there what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.589" end="00:08:57.320" style="s2">to him</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:08:59.240" style="s2">- Tim throw with the game B philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.320" end="00:09:01.640" style="s2">and not and I think that would be great</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.580" end="00:11:55.000" style="s2">been writing a lot I&#39;ve spoken with both</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.770" end="00:12:02.390" style="s2">guys were up to as well as what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">trying to accomplish which is still a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.390" end="00:12:08.210" style="s2">little vague although I have these big</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:10.430" style="s2">insights that pop up on occasion</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.210" end="00:12:12.710" style="s2">so last night I got really inspired</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.430" end="00:12:16.100" style="s2">after listening to another Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.710" end="00:12:19.250" style="s2">smocked in burger talk and so last</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.100" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">night&#39;s idea was kind of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.250" end="00:12:25.010" style="s2">science fiction novel that describes</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">like how we evolve into the next level</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.010" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">of thinking that allows us to get past</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:34.010" style="s2">the the struggles that we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:36.260" style="s2">with I&#39;m not sure that like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.010" end="00:12:38.960" style="s2">science fiction or even fiction is</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.260" end="00:12:41.180" style="s2">necessarily a great model to help the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.960" end="00:12:43.640" style="s2">world understand how to get to the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.180" end="00:12:47.450" style="s2">level I&#39;m also trying to just understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.640" end="00:12:50.660" style="s2">that myself so I&#39;ve found some things</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.450" end="00:12:54.080" style="s2">that I think are really key elements to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.660" end="00:12:56.600" style="s2">how we should be viewing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.080" end="00:12:59.770" style="s2">as a collection of systems where there</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.600" end="00:13:04.010" style="s2">are you know better and worse I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.770" end="00:13:06.890" style="s2">using Ken wolbers kind of terminologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.010" end="00:13:10.040" style="s2">around these different developmental</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.890" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">stages you know the world and is made up</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.040" end="00:13:15.890" style="s2">of a bunch of people we all have</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:17.390" style="s2">different worldviews the political</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.890" end="00:13:19.610" style="s2">divide and the polarization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.390" end="00:13:20.420" style="s2">occurring is because we have these</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.610" end="00:13:22.459" style="s2">different worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.420" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">and ideals that we hold dear to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.459" end="00:13:29.660" style="s2">ourselves the predominant one on a kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">of leftist liberal person but you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.660" end="00:13:34.100" style="s2">currently there&#39;s some problems with</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:37.940" style="s2">that worldview which kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.100" end="00:13:41.060" style="s2">equates everyone as being absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.940" end="00:13:47.029" style="s2">equal no you know no ifs ands or buts</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.060" end="00:13:49.310" style="s2">yet there&#39;s a and I irony or a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.029" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">in there which is that well clearly</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.310" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">people that are racist aren&#39;t equal we</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:13:57.019" style="s2">you know and I agree with that like no</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:13:59.300" style="s2">they have a lower worldview but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.019" end="00:14:03.529" style="s2">that next stage of development where we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.300" end="00:14:05.269" style="s2">become aware of systems worldviews being</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.529" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">able to honor what&#39;s right about them</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.269" end="00:14:09.139" style="s2">and then also be able to say well and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:11.510" style="s2">this is where the upper limit is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.139" end="00:14:14.779" style="s2">fill that upper limit for a you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.510" end="00:14:16.730" style="s2">leftist worldview is where it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.779" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">we&#39;re all equal that doesn&#39;t mean they</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.730" end="00:14:22.910" style="s2">were you know we&#39;re all born equal and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:25.899" style="s2">we should all be treated equally in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.910" end="00:14:30.279" style="s2">terms of respect and dignity although</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.899" end="00:14:33.529" style="s2">different ideas you know we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.279" end="00:14:36.140" style="s2">rethought in terms of you know how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.529" end="00:14:37.790" style="s2">can work together coherently because not</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.140" end="00:14:41.510" style="s2">everyone&#39;s the same level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.790" end="00:14:43.100" style="s2">intelligence for example so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.510" end="00:14:45.260" style="s2">controversial there&#39;s a lot of pushback</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.100" end="00:14:48.050" style="s2">in the political world right now about</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.260" end="00:14:49.550" style="s2">about these subjects so it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.050" end="00:14:52.279" style="s2">certain amount of courage and bravery to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:54.019" style="s2">go into them with enough detail so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.279" end="00:14:55.699" style="s2">you&#39;re not called erases because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.019" end="00:14:57.500" style="s2">saying you know well you&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.699" end="00:15:00.199" style="s2">limits that are dear to your worldview</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.500" end="00:15:04.670" style="s2">but so anyway I&#39;m you know I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.199" end="00:15:07.610" style="s2">find out ways to you know write about</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.670" end="00:15:10.279" style="s2">this that&#39;s really coherent and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.610" end="00:15:12.709" style="s2">lifts the dialogue out of our current</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.279" end="00:15:13.610" style="s2">our current paradigm but I also find it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.709" end="00:15:15.890" style="s2">just really interesting what other</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.610" end="00:15:18.079" style="s2">people are doing and getting inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.890" end="00:15:20.600" style="s2">from that and then if I can help people</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.079" end="00:15:22.430" style="s2">do that work that&#39;s great too I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.600" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">a CEO of a company before and raised</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.430" end="00:15:28.640" style="s2">lots of money and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:30.680" style="s2">experience in my world that could help</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.640" end="00:15:32.630" style="s2">on a collaborative level with something</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.680" end="00:15:34.009" style="s2">that that I felt really attracted to but</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:36.259" style="s2">I also don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.009" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">take so much time out of my life that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.259" end="00:15:43.009" style="s2">can&#39;t continue my efforts to become a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:46.459" style="s2">writer so that&#39;s it so I have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.009" end="00:15:49.579" style="s2">of things to say on that first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.459" end="00:15:53.749" style="s2">think science fiction is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.579" end="00:15:55.309" style="s2">most effective way early storytelling in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.749" end="00:15:59.689" style="s2">general is really fast effective way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.309" end="00:16:04.579" style="s2">change minds you know if you just look</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.689" end="00:16:08.179" style="s2">at the impact of Star Trek and and all a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.579" end="00:16:10.819" style="s2">lot of the other kind of worlds it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.179" end="00:16:12.920" style="s2">really tackled a lot of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.819" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">still working on today we&#39;re back in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.920" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">60s you know they they had an episode on</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:22.579" style="s2">on racism so I think that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:24.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a great way around and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.579" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">actually thought of sharing some of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.050" end="00:16:29.240" style="s2">concepts through storytelling okay doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:34.579" style="s2">a mystery novel where they use my</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.240" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">technology to solve the mystery so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.579" end="00:16:43.730" style="s2">would I think so I encourage you I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:45.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a good path to go and then some</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.730" end="00:16:50.990" style="s2">of the other things you suggested I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.559" end="00:16:52.819" style="s2">think I think some of your wording it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.990" end="00:16:54.769" style="s2">be interesting at some time to explore</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.819" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">some of the phrases and wording the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.769" end="00:17:00.829" style="s2">cheese because I think that some people</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:03.139" style="s2">would that that result in some boards</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.829" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">that are a little vague and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.139" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">in a potential interpretation could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:12.289" style="s2">not what you&#39;re intending so yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">which is always hard I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.289" end="00:17:16.250" style="s2">that the the heart is you&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:18.049" style="s2">probably know you know the hardest day</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.250" end="00:17:19.610" style="s2">was trying to explain your ideas in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.049" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">way that it gets in a person&#39;s brain</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.610" end="00:17:23.779" style="s2">right yeah I&#39;ve been doing fundraising</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:25.069" style="s2">which is a lot of that yeah and then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.779" end="00:17:27.020" style="s2">other thing is that you know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.069" end="00:17:28.429" style="s2">been doing if you&#39;ve been a CEO and been</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.020" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">fundraising I might it might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.429" end="00:17:35.539" style="s2">interesting for me to my project doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:37.399" style="s2">have a good funding model mm-hmm and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.539" end="00:17:40.760" style="s2">okay with potentially either keeping it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.399" end="00:17:42.139" style="s2">as a small project or a non-profit in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.760" end="00:17:46.669" style="s2">the future if I think I can prove out</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.139" end="00:17:47.430" style="s2">the idea but it it might be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.669" end="00:17:49.080" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.430" end="00:17:50.670" style="s2">have you kind of review it and see</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.080" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">whether you think there&#39;s a funding</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.670" end="00:17:55.470" style="s2">model I mean there&#39;s several potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:57.900" style="s2">ones but none of them are likely that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.470" end="00:18:00.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen and just get it be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.900" end="00:18:00.900" style="s2">to get an additional opinion sure yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.270" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">am</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.900" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">I had your when your guys had some</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">meeting with at least I think you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">Bentley maybe not a drill but the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:14.820" style="s2">three folk Kerry Jubilee Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.740" style="s2">yesterday for like two minutes and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.820" end="00:18:18.210" style="s2">just kind of barely heard something and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.740" end="00:18:20.040" style="s2">suddenly found something more</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.210" end="00:18:22.290" style="s2">interesting the cloak of God so I left</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.040" end="00:18:24.540" style="s2">and then this morning I open this window</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.290" end="00:18:26.340" style="s2">but then went and brush my teeth so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.540" end="00:18:29.190" style="s2">kind of missed what you were actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.340" end="00:18:30.780" style="s2">talking about and then when I came back</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.190" end="00:18:31.950" style="s2">from brushing my teeth someone was like</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.780" end="00:18:33.390" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re watching you should</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:35.940" style="s2">just pop in I&#39;m like what the hell I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.390" end="00:18:37.980" style="s2">pop in though I&#39;m totally new it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.940" end="00:18:39.810" style="s2">whatever anybody&#39;s ideas other like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.980" end="00:18:41.340" style="s2">heard Jubilees idea I think and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.810" end="00:18:44.520" style="s2">part of me was like oh maybe I should do</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.340" end="00:18:47.340" style="s2">a solution raising on what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.520" end="00:18:49.830" style="s2">format or formats because you know as</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.340" end="00:18:52.590" style="s2">you said like I think you know mythology</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.830" end="00:18:54.300" style="s2">and storytelling and and science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.590" end="00:18:56.370" style="s2">you know there&#39;s so many examples in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.300" end="00:18:59.070" style="s2">science fiction of things that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.370" end="00:19:00.570" style="s2">like in Star Trek the tricorder or you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.070" end="00:19:02.370" style="s2">know here&#39;s a communication device</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.570" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s wireless that can do all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.370" end="00:19:07.290" style="s2">different things and we have them now</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:09.720" style="s2">you know so these things do come in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.290" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">reality but it&#39;s kind of like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.720" end="00:19:14.190" style="s2">studying all these folks like Daniels</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.960" style="s2">Malcolm burger and Jordan Hall and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.190" end="00:19:17.670" style="s2">know what Ken Wilber describes as these</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.960" end="00:19:20.610" style="s2">tier 2 type thinkers where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.670" end="00:19:23.700" style="s2">integrating all of these complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.610" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">that are interrelated but separate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.700" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">how we can pull them all together into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:32.850" style="s2">coherent sense-making deal you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">trying to understand it enough so that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.850" end="00:19:37.650" style="s2">can write or currently enough that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:39.120" style="s2">comes across so I think that bounced</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.650" end="00:19:41.310" style="s2">around a little bit a lot there but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.120" end="00:19:43.530" style="s2">but I&#39;d yes I&#39;d be willing to hop on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.310" end="00:19:44.910" style="s2">phone with you separately if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.530" end="00:19:46.050" style="s2">a ship you know since I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.910" end="00:19:48.900" style="s2">waste everyone&#39;s time here if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.050" end="00:19:50.280" style="s2">already heard your story or your what</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.900" end="00:19:56.940" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to accomplish but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.280" end="00:19:59.810" style="s2">happy to do that so so I think Kerri if</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:19:59.810" style="s2">you understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.049" end="00:20:07.710" style="s2">you sorry and I&#39;m family and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.960" end="00:20:09.299" style="s2">guys turns up in the the project periods</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.710" end="00:20:11.669" style="s2">and I read what they were doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.299" end="00:20:13.139" style="s2">it was like transmedia storytelling now</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.669" end="00:20:16.230" style="s2">if you dominate about transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.139" end="00:20:17.460" style="s2">storytelling that&#39;s taking one story and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.230" end="00:20:20.129" style="s2">I judge you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.460" end="00:20:22.200" style="s2">different different formats so like so</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.129" end="00:20:24.330" style="s2">let&#39;s say like if you write a book if</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.200" end="00:20:26.429" style="s2">you want to have a film of that booth</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.330" end="00:20:28.889" style="s2">you have to adapt that story to fit the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.429" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">medium so it&#39;s basically the transmits</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.889" end="00:20:33.480" style="s2">transmedia storytelling it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:35.249" style="s2">fitting the story to the different</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.480" end="00:20:39.299" style="s2">mediums that are out there using you</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.249" end="00:20:41.489" style="s2">know like film animation a bit what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.299" end="00:20:43.230" style="s2">yeah so just to mention that because</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.489" end="00:20:45.899" style="s2">when I&#39;m of course transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.230" end="00:20:47.580" style="s2">storytelling Oh God about three years</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.899" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">ago because I wasn&#39;t too sure what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.580" end="00:20:53.879" style="s2">was and then all that stuff translate so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">say like if you you&#39;ve got a product or</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.879" end="00:20:56.999" style="s2">not and you doing this stuff trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:59.639" style="s2">mediate and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.999" end="00:21:01.559" style="s2">merchandise and and all of that it all</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.639" end="00:21:04.529" style="s2">links into kind of the seed from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.559" end="00:21:06.210" style="s2">story so I wanted to say that and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.529" end="00:21:08.279" style="s2">think that if you&#39;re nominated over</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.210" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">maybe go check it out because it I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.279" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">you though yeah it makes good sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:15.659" style="s2">yeah I I think I told you that scary</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:17.609" style="s2">before but like there&#39;s you know so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.659" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">for this kind of systems theory and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.609" end="00:21:23.850" style="s2">stuff is really kind of left brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:26.429" style="s2">logical and it&#39;s really inspiring but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.850" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">also write poetry so you know while I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.429" end="00:21:31.409" style="s2">been writing about some of those game be</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:33.090" style="s2">left brain stuff I&#39;ve also become so</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.409" end="00:21:36.379" style="s2">inspired that I end up writing poetry</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.090" end="00:21:39.929" style="s2">which is arguably very right brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.379" end="00:21:42.779" style="s2">approaches and it&#39;s funny how I can get</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.929" end="00:21:45.210" style="s2">an idea out in poetry in an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.779" end="00:21:47.669" style="s2">short amount of words mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.210" end="00:21:49.320" style="s2">that you know not everyone may relate</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.669" end="00:21:51.929" style="s2">with if they&#39;re not really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.320" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">understand what it is it&#39;s the same with</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.929" end="00:21:59.519" style="s2">with you no longer twenty paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:22:02.129" style="s2">essay on you know on what makes game be</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.519" end="00:22:04.889" style="s2">tick you know what or what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.129" end="00:22:06.779" style="s2">game a you know well I think to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.889" end="00:22:09.059" style="s2">honest like me personally I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.779" end="00:22:11.999" style="s2">I&#39;m in the middle between the logic the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.059" end="00:22:14.759" style="s2">data and the way win the floor good</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.999" end="00:22:17.969" style="s2">place talk in between other</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.759" end="00:22:19.199" style="s2">belonging either and so yeah so like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.969" end="00:22:20.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff that throws right</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.199" end="00:22:22.949" style="s2">over my head</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.039" end="00:22:25.799" style="s2">and but I&#39;m interested some curious I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.949" end="00:22:26.999" style="s2">like what&#39;s that yeah okay well maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.799" end="00:22:28.769" style="s2">need to look at that because I sent</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.999" end="00:22:30.779" style="s2">something in it there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.769" end="00:22:36.389" style="s2">that I can&#39;t articulate what&#39;s there I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.779" end="00:22:38.909" style="s2">the same with the fluff and the woo yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.389" end="00:22:40.979" style="s2">I get it you know really so has a set up</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.909" end="00:22:44.279" style="s2">so six Jubilee before there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.979" end="00:22:46.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge chasm that needs bridging</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.279" end="00:22:49.859" style="s2">mm-hmm I mean for people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.919" end="00:22:51.749" style="s2">but as I said people need to come to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.859" end="00:22:53.519" style="s2">things in their own time you can&#39;t kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.749" end="00:22:55.259" style="s2">of post it on them you can&#39;t preach at</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.519" end="00:22:57.599" style="s2">them they&#39;ve got a conference no time</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.259" end="00:23:00.209" style="s2">but you&#39;ve gotta leave the bread crumbs</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.599" end="00:23:01.979" style="s2">for the people to see yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.209" end="00:23:04.440" style="s2">I mean unless people start getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.979" end="00:23:06.659" style="s2">sorted and more to organize and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.440" end="00:23:08.249" style="s2">then they start looking you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.659" end="00:23:10.139" style="s2">boys having a place that they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.249" end="00:23:12.690" style="s2">actually come and start oh oh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.139" end="00:23:15.509" style="s2">that and then go from there to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.690" end="00:23:18.629" style="s2">you know I&#39;m terrible on a Google search</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.509" end="00:23:20.999" style="s2">for something I&#39;m like oh yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.629" end="00:23:23.159" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s how I came across this</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.999" end="00:23:25.739" style="s2">anyway I was just listening to rebel</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.159" end="00:23:28.319" style="s2">wisdom podcast and it&#39;s kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.739" end="00:23:31.459" style="s2">interested in like the you know sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.319" end="00:23:35.549" style="s2">making stuff and it took a while for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.459" end="00:23:37.649" style="s2">to even hear about game B when I finally</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.549" end="00:23:39.179" style="s2">heard about I was like what oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.649" end="00:23:40.619" style="s2">there&#39;s people that got together and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.179" end="00:23:42.209" style="s2">was trying to rethink this from a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.619" end="00:23:43.819" style="s2">fundamental level I&#39;ve been doing it out</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.209" end="00:23:46.859" style="s2">of my head for years but it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.819" end="00:23:48.329" style="s2">you know I was just this semi lonely</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.859" end="00:23:50.879" style="s2">voice out there and then I was like wow</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.329" end="00:23:56.129" style="s2">this is an entire movement sign me up</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.879" end="00:23:58.289" style="s2">so anyway I&#39;ve played with a few ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.129" end="00:23:59.669" style="s2">and Karie pop in it could we said you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.289" end="00:24:01.079" style="s2">be the hot seat if you wanted to be so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.669" end="00:24:02.609" style="s2">if you actually the hot seat smells like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.079" end="00:24:06.869" style="s2">we&#39;re putting you in the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.609" end="00:24:09.359" style="s2">but the idea of storytelling I like my</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.869" end="00:24:11.940" style="s2">favorite genre is dystopia but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.359" end="00:24:14.069" style="s2">trying to create proto PIA but then like</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.940" end="00:24:16.469" style="s2">besides the story of how you get there</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.069" end="00:24:18.749" style="s2">which I&#39;m sure is interesting once</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.469" end="00:24:20.249" style="s2">you&#39;re there it&#39;s like well what stories</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.749" end="00:24:22.919" style="s2">are there to tell and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.249" end="00:24:25.649" style="s2">almost what breaks it in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.919" end="00:24:28.740" style="s2">is like we feel like a beautiful world</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.649" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">to be so boring what</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.740" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">stories can you tell in that world and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:36.540" style="s2">of course not like every story nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:38.370" style="s2">right like love and adventure and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.540" end="00:24:40.350" style="s2">element still exists but what does that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.370" end="00:24:43.320" style="s2">leave together and look like in a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.350" end="00:24:45.240" style="s2">that that brings the audience along for</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.320" end="00:24:48.150" style="s2">the journey and the characters and not</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.240" end="00:24:50.820" style="s2">and then almost subconsciously gets them</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.150" end="00:24:52.770" style="s2">the the information of integral or game</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.820" end="00:24:56.370" style="s2">B or a beautiful new world that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.770" end="00:24:57.929" style="s2">possible mm-hmm yeah the story I got all</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.370" end="00:25:02.130" style="s2">inspired about last night was basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.929" end="00:25:05.280" style="s2">you know starts off in the proto Pia you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.130" end="00:25:08.340" style="s2">know this like most of most of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.280" end="00:25:10.650" style="s2">world&#39;s challenging jobs were automated</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.340" end="00:25:13.470" style="s2">you know nature was really protected</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.650" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">people didn&#39;t necessarily work for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.470" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">living they did what was really passion</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.960" end="00:25:23.220" style="s2">to them and followed their own curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:26.370" style="s2">and passions into creating things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.220" end="00:25:30.150" style="s2">were beneficial to everyone and in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.370" end="00:25:33.059" style="s2">world around but it kind of goes into</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.150" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">you know the deaths and tragedy that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.059" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">occurred a couple generations before</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:40.260" style="s2">which was when you know the world went</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:42.660" style="s2">through that transformational process</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.260" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">and kind of describes you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.660" end="00:25:46.950" style="s2">painful realities of you know the loss</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">of people that went through basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.950" end="00:25:52.050" style="s2">kind of a revolution not necessarily war</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:54.179" style="s2">but and gone too far into it yet but</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.050" end="00:25:57.330" style="s2">just yet kind of what we&#39;re stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.179" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">right now you know and out and I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.330" end="00:26:03.150" style="s2">think that you know a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:05.010" style="s2">instability happens within nature like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.150" end="00:26:07.410" style="s2">evolution doesn&#39;t really occur unless</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.010" end="00:26:09.960" style="s2">your environments under threat it just</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.410" end="00:26:11.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen you know and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.960" end="00:26:14.040" style="s2">same for humans like typically we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.970" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">really learn a lesson and was it hurts a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.040" end="00:26:20.429" style="s2">little bit unfortunately so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:21.660" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s like I think all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.429" end="00:26:25.350" style="s2">people that feel stressed depressed</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.660" end="00:26:26.730" style="s2">anxious worried about you know the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.350" end="00:26:28.800" style="s2">that just shows that they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.730" end="00:26:31.559" style="s2">healthy I mean because that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.800" end="00:26:34.860" style="s2">should be feeling when we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.559" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">situation written so I&#39;m trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.860" end="00:26:40.200" style="s2">know put a bright spin on the pain that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:42.360" style="s2">were currently experiencing and I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.200" end="00:26:43.110" style="s2">do feel like we are on you know might</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.360" end="00:26:46.500" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.110" end="00:26:48.750" style="s2">- I mean - would be very fast you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.500" end="00:26:52.350" style="s2">might take a decade to 15 years before I</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.750" end="00:26:54.030" style="s2">think we are elevated at that next level</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.350" end="00:26:58.500" style="s2">but that&#39;s kind of what my passion is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.030" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">to help promote those voices as well as</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.500" end="00:27:05.370" style="s2">my own to show what that next world can</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.260" end="00:27:50.400" style="s2">then have an art show or an exhibition</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:53.130" style="s2">where I was able to share that or give</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.400" end="00:27:55.950" style="s2">it to community that could then practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.130" end="00:27:58.049" style="s2">this game be as just kind of a art</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.950" end="00:28:01.919" style="s2">experiment and see where it goes I think</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.929" end="00:32:11.970" style="s2">the characters on the enterprise because</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.169" end="00:32:13.710" style="s2">they kind of pictured that as this they</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.970" end="00:32:17.070" style="s2">they have reached that state where they</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.710" end="00:32:18.809" style="s2">communicate well and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.070" end="00:32:21.869" style="s2">of course he they did also have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.809" end="00:32:24.119" style="s2">counselor on board which I think was</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.869" end="00:32:25.710" style="s2">great but they ended up having you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.119" end="00:32:27.059" style="s2">just deciding that they were gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.710" end="00:32:29.610" style="s2">internal conflicts between the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.059" end="00:32:31.980" style="s2">characters for story purposes as my</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.610" end="00:32:34.139" style="s2">understanding but also the benefit doing</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.139" end="00:32:49.619" style="s2">is that you&#39;re constantly reaching new</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.090" end="00:32:52.590" style="s2">cultures so yeah so it just culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.619" end="00:32:56.759" style="s2">conflict worse or maybe the cultures</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.590" end="00:32:58.860" style="s2">might even have pieces of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.759" end="00:33:01.080" style="s2">different psycho technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.860" end="00:33:03.570" style="s2">calling them in the game be in rebel</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.080" end="00:33:05.340" style="s2">wisdom space I think and then them</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.570" end="00:33:07.889" style="s2">conflicting and learning the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.340" end="00:33:09.749" style="s2">technology of communicating better would</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.889" end="00:33:11.789" style="s2">be might be an interesting solution for</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.749" end="00:33:14.940" style="s2">that and then I don&#39;t know why I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.789" end="00:33:16.919" style="s2">that I think no matter how far we get</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.940" end="00:33:21.029" style="s2">there will always be kind of an internal</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.919" end="00:33:23.070" style="s2">conflict but but I guess the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.029" end="00:33:23.809" style="s2">that they would they would then show</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.070" end="00:33:26.299" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.809" end="00:33:28.489" style="s2">they be reminding each other of okay now</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.299" end="00:33:30.440" style="s2">I understand your frustration you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.489" end="00:33:35.029" style="s2">but here&#39;s the tool that we use in these</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.440" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">type of situations might be I I think I</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.029" end="00:33:41.950" style="s2">would find that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:44.059" style="s2">yeah Reid I mean I think one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.950" end="00:33:46.009" style="s2">interesting out oh no effect quite call</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.059" end="00:33:49.460" style="s2">it a struggle but one of the struggles</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.009" end="00:33:51.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve had in understanding you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.460" end="00:33:57.139" style="s2">basic framework for game a which part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.950" end="00:33:58.759" style="s2">is described as non hierarchical is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.139" end="00:33:59.839" style="s2">you know that sounds great because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.759" end="00:34:01.700" style="s2">know there&#39;s obviously so much pushback</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.839" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">against the patriarchy and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.700" end="00:34:06.979" style="s2">really good critiques of what is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:10.250" style="s2">with that type of mindset in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.979" end="00:34:12.379" style="s2">yet at the same time how do you do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.250" end="00:34:16.460" style="s2">when there clearly are people that know</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.379" end="00:34:19.569" style="s2">better ways to do things and people that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.460" end="00:34:22.069" style="s2">are holding us back from doing that so</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.569" end="00:34:24.319" style="s2">you know you&#39;re kind of describing like</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.069" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">you know if they&#39;re willing to make use</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.319" end="00:34:29.389" style="s2">of these tools then we can find a common</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:32.799" style="s2">language with which to you know attain</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.389" end="00:34:37.849" style="s2">new levels of coherence in our systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.799" end="00:34:41.240" style="s2">but you know I mean it&#39;s hard when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.849" end="00:34:45.409" style="s2">know there&#39;s cultures that are still you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.240" end="00:34:47.859" style="s2">know arguably third world countries I</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.409" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">mean they just don&#39;t have the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.859" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">complexity the intercultural connections</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:57.980" style="s2">the education to be able to picture it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:00.680" style="s2">so you know we have this different</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:01.849" style="s2">strata levels of understanding going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.680" end="00:35:03.740" style="s2">so it&#39;s part of the reason I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.849" end="00:35:06.230" style="s2">storytelling is so good is because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.740" end="00:35:08.150" style="s2">can kind of create metaphors for it but</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.230" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">I did struggle a bit in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.150" end="00:35:16.029" style="s2">well what would this proto you know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:17.180" style="s2">new way of this new world looked like</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.029" end="00:35:19.640" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.180" end="00:35:21.829" style="s2">you know nobody making decisions you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.640" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">know how is the collective making a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.829" end="00:35:32.150" style="s2">decision how do you filter the less the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:33.890" style="s2">less now there&#39;s me a bunch of voices</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.150" end="00:35:36.020" style="s2">that never feel heard because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.890" end="00:35:38.470" style="s2">not providing good solutions to things</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.020" end="00:35:41.750" style="s2">so how do you filter the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.470" end="00:35:44.150" style="s2">Solutions out than the less good</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.750" end="00:35:50.890" style="s2">solutions out without making people feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.150" end="00:35:50.890" style="s2">incredibly unheard you know so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.810" end="00:36:02.330" style="s2">everybody hello learn what appointment</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:05.050" style="s2">if there&#39;s time here is my mic on yep</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.330" end="00:36:05.050" style="s2">yeah it is good</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:15.980" style="s2">well thanks for having me I&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.810" end="00:36:19.220" style="s2">Wallflower for a bit and little</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.980" end="00:36:21.800" style="s2">background on me I became a student of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.220" end="00:36:25.370" style="s2">ontology about I don&#39;t know I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.800" end="00:36:28.610" style="s2">might be like 10 years ago had a coach</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.370" end="00:36:34.390" style="s2">to introduce me to spiral dynamics ken</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.610" end="00:36:37.970" style="s2">wilber ah I guess before that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.390" end="00:36:38.990" style="s2">psychologist I was dating and my wife</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.970" end="00:36:41.720" style="s2">ended up showing me a book about</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.990" end="00:36:46.850" style="s2">introverts so I saw all this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.720" end="00:36:49.100" style="s2">about people like me finally felt like</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.850" end="00:36:51.820" style="s2">others people that think like me and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.100" end="00:36:56.630" style="s2">have these ideas like and not alone</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.820" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">process information like me so yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.630" end="00:37:08.570" style="s2">felt quite good so I own a business in</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:10.010" style="s2">Seattle Washington I lasted ten months</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.570" end="00:37:12.950" style="s2">in the corporate world built my own</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.010" end="00:37:15.110" style="s2">business immediately I can only do what</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.950" end="00:37:20.750" style="s2">I want to do I can only do things on my</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.110" end="00:37:22.550" style="s2">terms and so I built the business over</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.750" end="00:37:24.670" style="s2">20 years and now I want to go do</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.550" end="00:37:27.260" style="s2">something with that money</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.670" end="00:37:30.950" style="s2">and it feels weird to me being a person</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.260" end="00:37:34.790" style="s2">that you know I build websites do retail</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.950" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">we own bars cafes and I desperately want</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.790" end="00:37:40.790" style="s2">to give all the money away yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.200" style="s2">reluctant to do so because my wife</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.790" end="00:37:46.940" style="s2">actually runs the philanthropy program</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.200" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">at our at our office and I told her to</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.940" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">just go donate</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:55.860" style="s2">don&#39;t go write checks to people we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:58.590" style="s2">a huge audience and let&#39;s use our money</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.860" end="00:38:00.870" style="s2">to leverage so instead of giving five</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.590" end="00:38:05.100" style="s2">$10,000 checks to organizations she runs</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.870" end="00:38:06.420" style="s2">events that generate one to three</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.100" end="00:38:08.450" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars at a time for</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.420" end="00:38:14.040" style="s2">the same organizations that we would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.450" end="00:38:16.410" style="s2">giving to and so anyway I have a thesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.040" end="00:38:18.390" style="s2">in mind a project I&#39;ve been sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.410" end="00:38:24.870" style="s2">for a long time of that domain I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.390" end="00:38:26.730" style="s2">sitting on for a long time and funny</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.870" end="00:38:29.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve never really run it by anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.730" end="00:38:33.030" style="s2">would actually not just listen to me and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.490" end="00:38:36.420" style="s2">say cool John you&#39;re like the people</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.030" end="00:38:40.140" style="s2">that could actually get behind an idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.420" end="00:38:41.910" style="s2">like this and anyway my thesis says I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.140" end="00:38:46.260" style="s2">look around at Misty Island we have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.910" end="00:38:51.120" style="s2">lot of homelessness right now among the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.260" end="00:38:53.340" style="s2">problems that most cities have and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.120" end="00:39:00.080" style="s2">firmly believe there&#39;s plenty of money</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.340" end="00:39:02.520" style="s2">floating around to solve the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.080" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">whether I&#39;m talking to wealthy friends</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.520" end="00:39:07.860" style="s2">or not wealthy friends I said if you had</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:11.220" style="s2">a good way to map your wealth to help</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.860" end="00:39:14.370" style="s2">the people that need the wealth would</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.220" end="00:39:17.370" style="s2">you do it and I&#39;ve never heard a single</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.370" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">person say no I philosophically opposed</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.370" end="00:39:24.510" style="s2">to moving my money people that are less</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:28.080" style="s2">deserving needy not my problem everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.510" end="00:39:32.420" style="s2">seems plugged in and as silly as it may</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.080" end="00:39:36.210" style="s2">sound I think the actual problem is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.420" end="00:39:38.430" style="s2">there&#39;s not a convenient conduit to move</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.210" end="00:39:39.990" style="s2">the money and there&#39;s a low trust level</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.430" end="00:39:41.670" style="s2">if I write a check to somebody you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.990" end="00:39:43.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I hope they do something</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.670" end="00:39:45.300" style="s2">good a good even we&#39;re in Buffett rolls</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.110" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">this way I think that thirty billion</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.300" end="00:39:49.590" style="s2">dollars the organizations that I believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:55.140" style="s2">in how can you do that if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:57.230" style="s2">there watching it happen don&#39;t you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.140" end="00:39:59.180" style="s2">to be more plugged in</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.230" end="00:40:01.640" style="s2">so I realized that this worked for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.180" end="00:40:06.680" style="s2">when I joined have you all used Kiva or</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.640" end="00:40:11.390" style="s2">heard of kiva.org heard of it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.680" end="00:40:12.740" style="s2">a micro lending platform yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.390" end="00:40:15.230" style="s2">make loans generally to third world</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.740" end="00:40:17.420" style="s2">countries usually for small retail</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.230" end="00:40:20.690" style="s2">businesses the kinds you&#39;ve seen on</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.420" end="00:40:25.190" style="s2">vacations they get into education</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.690" end="00:40:27.380" style="s2">farming and things like that but but it</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.190" end="00:40:31.160" style="s2">covers the full gamut anyway you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.380" end="00:40:32.690" style="s2">loan as little as $25 and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.160" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">generally you&#39;re $25 you get paid back</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.690" end="00:40:36.470" style="s2">and then you lend it to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">and then you can opt into a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.470" end="00:40:41.780" style="s2">tip that goes the organization so that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.950" style="s2">they can run their affairs and I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.780" end="00:40:45.799" style="s2">sit in bed at night with my daughter and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.950" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll donate money to women and third</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.799" end="00:40:50.020" style="s2">world countries running businesses</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:52.910" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a sector I&#39;ve chosen and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.020" end="00:40:55.280" style="s2">I&#39;m just stunned of their ability to pay</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.910" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">that money back you know me Here I am</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.280" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">helping people far away it&#39;s kind of fun</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:01.220" style="s2">because you have people trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:04.730" style="s2">their business to the next level and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.220" end="00:41:06.920" style="s2">they literally need like $200 so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.730" end="00:41:08.390" style="s2">makes you feel really thing more</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.920" end="00:41:14.510" style="s2">powerful and capable than you normally</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.390" end="00:41:15.740" style="s2">feel you&#39;re carrying some fans and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.510" end="00:41:17.299" style="s2">give the money away and it comes back</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.740" end="00:41:20.359" style="s2">I&#39;m like this isn&#39;t me giving away</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.299" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">anything this is just me giving other</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.359" end="00:41:27.470" style="s2">people access to my unused capital the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:29.240" style="s2">thing I find the funniest about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.470" end="00:41:30.680" style="s2">website is people can join into groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.240" end="00:41:33.410" style="s2">so you can affiliate with whoever</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.680" end="00:41:36.049" style="s2">whatever group so I individually have</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.410" end="00:41:38.270" style="s2">loaned this much money but the group I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.049" end="00:41:41.930" style="s2">officiate with has also moved this much</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.270" end="00:41:44.690" style="s2">money the top two donators are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.930" end="00:41:47.450" style="s2">Christians and the atheists interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.690" end="00:41:49.309" style="s2">very in a battle to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.450" end="00:41:51.710" style="s2">charitable and it&#39;s actually really fun</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.309" end="00:41:53.180" style="s2">to watch because it&#39;s not what you would</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.710" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">expect to see on a website like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.180" end="00:41:57.859" style="s2">okay so anywho I want to build a piece</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:02.650" style="s2">of technology that works kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.859" end="00:42:04.910" style="s2">Kiva I hate to use the word gamified but</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.650" end="00:42:06.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a good metaphor what works about</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.910" end="00:42:09.380" style="s2">gamification there&#39;s a satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.530" end="00:42:10.490" style="s2">knowing tactically got my phone I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:11.120" style="s2">hitting the widgets I know what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.350" end="00:44:21.210" style="s2">wanted the Phoenix lighthouse so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:22.380" style="s2">let these little lighthouses all over</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.210" end="00:44:23.810" style="s2">the place that people could come and</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.810" end="00:44:28.460" style="s2">not a solution reason with them do you</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.910" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">made and now being homeless and for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.080" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">long the time and and you just want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:42.680" style="s2">give up on your life and it&#39;s your life</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:45.170" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got do you want to give up</p>

<p begin="00:44:45.170" end="00:44:50.120" style="s2">just can&#39;t can&#39;t do it anymore so what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.320" end="00:44:52.040" style="s2">was talking to Jubilee I realize this</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.120" end="00:44:54.170" style="s2">Phoenix lighthouse idea it was but</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.040" end="00:44:56.870" style="s2">because like when there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.170" end="00:44:58.610" style="s2">fall through the cracks and society like</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.870" end="00:45:01.130" style="s2">he falls through the cracks you go to an</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.610" end="00:45:03.290" style="s2">organization that are set up to my book</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.130" end="00:45:05.480" style="s2">and all these charity organizations are</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.290" end="00:45:08.030" style="s2">self twelve you go to them you take you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.480" end="00:45:09.560" style="s2">don&#39;t fit our criteria we can&#39;t help you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.030" end="00:45:13.190" style="s2">but you still need help at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.560" end="00:45:14.450" style="s2">the day so back then I wanted to help</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.190" end="00:45:17.990" style="s2">the people who are falling through the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.450" end="00:45:19.310" style="s2">cracks you know I mean so my idea was to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.990" end="00:45:20.900" style="s2">build these little kind of like little</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.310" end="00:45:23.780" style="s2">bed-and-breakfast is so people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.900" end="00:45:25.850" style="s2">falling and slipping rather than wakeful</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.780" end="00:45:28.040" style="s2">that in the gutter then we could come</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.850" end="00:45:29.810" style="s2">and stay and we&#39;ve been that way for</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.040" end="00:45:32.270" style="s2">people around them to help them get get</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.810" end="00:45:34.040" style="s2">them on the feet and and I&#39;ll build them</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.270" end="00:45:35.660" style="s2">up and and that net worth your life and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.040" end="00:45:38.630" style="s2">as I said I was in their children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.660" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">rooms but a few years and I come out to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.630" end="00:45:42.290" style="s2">that and when you come out I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:45.350" style="s2">I know some of the kids in the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.290" end="00:45:47.510" style="s2">thing out no family nobody so once they</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.350" end="00:45:49.640" style="s2">get kicked out of the care system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.510" end="00:45:51.380" style="s2">it they&#39;ve got nothing so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.640" end="00:45:53.750" style="s2">gather it out of place as I said like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.380" end="00:45:57.560" style="s2">bad leg has become stay was a matter</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.750" end="00:45:59.180" style="s2">where you dark come and stay and and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.560" end="00:46:01.730" style="s2">as I said to be and building that way</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.180" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">for now now though people from jail to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.730" end="00:46:05.720" style="s2">get the one that beateth that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:07.130" style="s2">being what to do so if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.720" end="00:46:08.900" style="s2">one-to-one child because like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.130" end="00:46:10.790" style="s2">obviously I found ya everywhere and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.900" end="00:46:12.530" style="s2">got no money but if you and your people</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.790" end="00:46:14.660" style="s2">wanted to go and through that over there</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.530" end="00:46:16.730" style="s2">I&#39;d love to come and help yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.660" end="00:46:18.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a really cool idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.730" end="00:46:19.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually been digging into</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.470" end="00:46:23.510" style="s2">something that&#39;s kind of a similar</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.970" end="00:46:26.750" style="s2">concept have you heard of Oxford home no</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.510" end="00:46:30.290" style="s2">I mean okay my guy I think he start in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.750" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">the 80s next alcoholic he built this</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.290" end="00:46:37.310" style="s2">framework for addicts no I uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s really open source really</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.310" end="00:46:42.230" style="s2">to play there&#39;s a central agency that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:44.420" style="s2">really lightweight mm-hmm but Jenna that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.230" end="00:46:47.510" style="s2">happens is it takes six to nine people</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.420" end="00:46:48.590" style="s2">who gather and say we&#39;re all addicts if</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.510" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">we want to get sober</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.590" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">there you go find a landlord willing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:56.150" style="s2">rent a house to them mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:58.220" style="s2">rent usually ends up being you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.150" end="00:47:00.620" style="s2">rather affordable because of the number</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.220" end="00:47:05.330" style="s2">of people they build a charter and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.620" end="00:47:07.970" style="s2">self manage this house and you might</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.330" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">think if I grab six to nine addicts and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.970" end="00:47:13.870" style="s2">put them in a house together that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:16.760" style="s2">recipe for some really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.870" end="00:47:19.100" style="s2">remarkably successful yeah well it</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.760" end="00:47:20.630" style="s2">depends what stage that are if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.100" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">not in that stage that they&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.630" end="00:47:23.900" style="s2">give up then putting them in with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:26.120" style="s2">others who are ready to give up that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.900" end="00:47:29.050" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna you know you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.120" end="00:47:31.160" style="s2">and I what I suspect makes it work is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.050" end="00:47:33.980" style="s2">nothing makes change harder than some on</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.160" end="00:47:35.690" style="s2">two levels ahead of you yeah because my</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.980" end="00:47:38.300" style="s2">thing is you realize when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.690" end="00:47:40.220" style="s2">hooter them just how hard it is to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.300" end="00:47:42.830" style="s2">out and as I said my things we should</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.220" end="00:47:44.900" style="s2">say like at the time years ago I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.830" end="00:47:46.550" style="s2">trying to build a network and I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.900" end="00:47:49.160" style="s2">trying to open up a little drop in</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.550" end="00:47:50.780" style="s2">offices because then I couldn&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.160" end="00:47:53.180" style="s2">job and I was still selling you sorry</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.780" end="00:47:55.310" style="s2">and I was stuck and catch-22 I spent</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.180" end="00:47:56.840" style="s2">like probably got no experience from</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.310" end="00:47:59.090" style="s2">that right so I was trying to settle the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.840" end="00:48:01.400" style="s2">drop in office and what we would do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.090" end="00:48:03.290" style="s2">like the micro businesses and people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.400" end="00:48:06.380" style="s2">couldn&#39;t afford so like big accountancy</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.290" end="00:48:08.150" style="s2">fees and we would teeth we would do</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.380" end="00:48:10.040" style="s2">their bookkeeping and administration</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.150" end="00:48:11.990" style="s2">stuff well given the people who sleep it</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.040" end="00:48:12.320" style="s2">on people&#39;s couches and have nowhere to</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.990" end="00:48:14.120" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.320" end="00:48:15.440" style="s2">and they would get to know the people</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.120" end="00:48:17.810" style="s2">who were starting the business list</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:19.940" style="s2">because your circumstances dictate who</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.810" end="00:48:21.500" style="s2">you meets now when I when I was homeless</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">think you need to have a some type of</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.540" end="00:55:11.600" style="s2">just see how they respond I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.030" end="00:55:14.360" style="s2">how they would respond want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.600" end="00:55:16.730" style="s2">changing and you&#39;ve got to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.360" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">stage and you like can&#39;t do this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.730" end="00:55:25.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s basically that stage</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:26.750" style="s2">and you&#39;re suddenly open for change and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.130" end="00:55:30.020" style="s2">it works mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.750" end="00:55:32.090" style="s2">so we are in the last five minutes of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.020" end="00:55:34.550" style="s2">the round table I love what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.090" end="00:55:36.530" style="s2">merging I wanted to add I know I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.550" end="00:55:39.410" style="s2">familiar fairly familiar with microloans</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.530" end="00:55:43.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve been interested in the space since</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.410" end="00:55:46.790" style="s2">I career circle to decades ago there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.160" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">something about the Oxford that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.790" end="00:55:50.630" style="s2">who are addicts can get together and say</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:52.040" style="s2">we are ready and we&#39;re gonna support</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.630" end="00:55:54.950" style="s2">each other even if that doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.040" end="00:55:56.930" style="s2">perfect and get a house together that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.950" end="00:56:00.350" style="s2">also reminds me of the beginning stages</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.930" end="00:56:01.730" style="s2">or maybe it was 2.0 microlending where</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.350" end="00:56:03.260" style="s2">people did get together and they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.730" end="00:56:04.820" style="s2">each other&#39;s collateral they were like</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.260" end="00:56:06.050" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of getting and so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.820" end="00:56:07.820" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t get the next level of loan</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.050" end="00:56:09.650" style="s2">until you&#39;ve got the previous loan and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.820" end="00:56:11.480" style="s2">having people come together be like we</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.650" end="00:56:13.910" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be homeless right so we</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.480" end="00:56:16.940" style="s2">are gonna find a house and having a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.910" end="00:56:18.500" style="s2">that people who have money can support</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.940" end="00:56:22.250" style="s2">that and see because I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.500" end="00:56:24.290" style="s2">just more trust there more and more less</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.250" end="00:56:26.180" style="s2">risk right that money isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.290" end="00:56:27.620" style="s2">paid back or that there isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.180" end="00:56:31.190" style="s2">be a positive outcome coming out the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.620" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">other end and empowering that process is</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.190" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">in and of itself employment like it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">music I&#39;ll turn it in that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:46.220" style="s2">totally get what I was trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:47.990" style="s2">if you build this organization to me the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.220" end="00:56:50.090" style="s2">most elegant thing to do is you need</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.990" end="00:56:52.610" style="s2">field workers going out and who</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.090" end="00:56:54.920" style="s2">needs what are people their part is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.610" end="00:56:57.080" style="s2">thing working if you made those very</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.920" end="00:56:59.090" style="s2">field workers the people that needed the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.080" end="00:57:02.420" style="s2">help in the first place you&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.090" end="00:57:03.800" style="s2">employment into the system yep and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.420" end="00:57:06.380" style="s2">you can build on that you&#39;ve built like</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.800" end="00:57:09.260" style="s2">a kernel that can actually grow from its</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.380" end="00:57:12.260" style="s2">own resources and I can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.260" end="00:57:14.450" style="s2">anything more powerful than then play</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.260" end="00:57:15.890" style="s2">from open the wealth coming from without</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.450" end="00:57:18.320" style="s2">kind of like energy comes into any</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.890" end="00:57:20.120" style="s2">system so we&#39;re down to our last few</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.320" end="00:57:21.800" style="s2">minutes I wanted to I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.120" end="00:57:24.800" style="s2">lot of passion here about your project</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.800" end="00:57:27.290" style="s2">John absolutely but I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.800" end="00:57:29.900" style="s2">a perfect project to a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.290" end="00:57:34.490" style="s2">on to get people together and say hey</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.120" end="00:57:41.270" style="s2">months ago where someone would come on</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.270" end="00:57:44.810" style="s2">here&#39;s what I want to get it at the hour</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.620" end="00:57:45.860" style="s2">and we would just crowd-sourced that</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.780" end="00:58:00.620" style="s2">something you were interested in I think</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.520" end="00:59:37.960" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been you know just it&#39;s been my</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.440" end="00:59:40.250" style="s2">life now for a few weeks and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.960" end="00:59:41.630" style="s2">that&#39;s when I learned of it I just got</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.250" end="00:59:43.640" style="s2">so excited that I&#39;ve spent all this time</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.630" end="00:59:45.380" style="s2">and and I&#39;ve learned of all these</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.640" end="00:59:47.390" style="s2">different elements from ken ken wilber</p>

<p begin="01:00:08.580" end="01:00:13.740" style="s2">only really one thing you can do in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.500" end="01:00:15.060" style="s2">world that actually matters most of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.740" end="01:00:16.619" style="s2">we do is if distraction the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.060" end="01:00:20.790" style="s2">you can do that action matters is how</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.619" end="01:00:25.050" style="s2">you treat your fellow human and it&#39;s</p>
