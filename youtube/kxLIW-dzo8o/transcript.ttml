<p begin="00:00:42.560" end="00:00:49.190" style="s2">have to take a much broader our system&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.610" end="00:01:21.380" style="s2">more about how you see I think in all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.560" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">this we have to focus on what the goals</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.380" end="00:01:28.040" style="s2">are for the system in fact what we what</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:31.250" style="s2">we would really like is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.040" end="00:01:33.170" style="s2">healthy high quality of life for humans</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.250" end="00:01:35.689" style="s2">and other species that we share the</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.689" end="00:01:42.880" style="s2">time we want it to be sustainable so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.210" end="00:01:46.130" style="s2">this brings up the issues of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.880" end="00:01:48.520" style="s2">conceptualize and how to require Phi the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.130" end="00:01:52.280" style="s2">health of a system of a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.520" end="00:01:53.930" style="s2">and there I think new ways that we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.280" end="00:01:55.580" style="s2">to start thinking about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.930" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">health is more than the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.580" end="00:02:00.080" style="s2">disease health is well functioning well</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:02.710" style="s2">functioning from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.080" end="00:02:05.750" style="s2">the goals that I just mentioned includes</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.710" end="00:02:08.689" style="s2">supporting human well-being and quality</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.750" end="00:02:11.000" style="s2">of life and supporting the health of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.689" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">ecological life support system which</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.000" end="00:02:15.240" style="s2">contributes significantly to to human</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:18.660" style="s2">health and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.240" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">being so in order to do that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.660" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">to think about all of the services that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.290" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">ecological systems provide to to human</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:29.580" style="s2">societies that support that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">well-being we have to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">health of the ecological system in terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">of its continued ability to to provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">those those services for that support</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:42.990" style="s2">human health we have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">human health in a more preventive way as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.990" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">as well functioning as high quality of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:50.460" style="s2">life rather than then simply the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:53.850" style="s2">absence of the disease and that leads us</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.460" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">to be more preventive in our medicine</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">both for the human population but also</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:12.780" style="s2">for the ecological system that supports</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">that human population so one way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.780" end="00:03:18.390" style="s2">thinking about the system and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:21.780" style="s2">support for human wellbeing is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.390" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">categorize things into four major types</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.780" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">of capital capital used very broadly in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:32.520" style="s2">this context I mean a stock that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:34.920" style="s2">supports a flow of services so we know</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.520" end="00:03:36.300" style="s2">about the conventional forms of economic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.920" end="00:03:40.410" style="s2">capital what you might call the built</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.300" end="00:03:42.960" style="s2">capital environment there&#39;s also human</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.410" end="00:03:45.330" style="s2">capital which is individual people there</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.960" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">but much more than their labor it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.330" end="00:03:49.770" style="s2">it&#39;s also includes their their</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:52.110" style="s2">intelligence their information their</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.770" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">creativity all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.110" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">individual humans provide us as well as</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">their individual health but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">also social capital which is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:07.830" style="s2">interaction between people both formal</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:11.190" style="s2">and informal networks and institutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.830" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2">that allow human society to function as</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.190" end="00:04:17.670" style="s2">a as a whole and finally there&#39;s natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.760" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">capital which is natural ecosystems and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.670" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">all of the services that they that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">provide obviously these four types of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:28.630" style="s2">capital have different characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">and different ways that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.630" end="00:04:34.600" style="s2">enhanced in different ways that they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">be eroded social capital required in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.600" end="00:04:39.490" style="s2">order to construct requires people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">interact in these networks and to build</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.490" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">trust in the networks it&#39;s so they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:49.540" style="s2">they can depend on the society to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:53.350" style="s2">help them achieve their goals natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.540" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">capital is is self replicating and self</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.350" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">repairing and so it&#39;s not that we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:01.090" style="s2">build this natural capital but we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">certainly enhance and facilitate its its</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.090" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">self replication we can conserve it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">preserve it built capital obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:11.830" style="s2">need to design that built capital</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">environment and we need to design it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.830" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">a way that&#39;s that enhances the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:19.510" style="s2">forms of capital the the natural and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:22.450" style="s2">social capital in particular as well as</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.510" end="00:05:24.670" style="s2">the the human capital and we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.450" end="00:05:26.920" style="s2">certainly invest in human capital in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.670" end="00:05:32.020" style="s2">various ways through through education</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.920" end="00:05:33.730" style="s2">and etc so and research so we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.020" end="00:05:37.420" style="s2">all of those things in a more integrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.730" end="00:05:39.310" style="s2">way that acknowledges the joint</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.420" end="00:05:42.100" style="s2">contributions of all four of these types</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.310" end="00:05:54.190" style="s2">of capital to sustainable human</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.100" end="00:05:57.550" style="s2">well-being the gund Institute for</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.190" end="00:06:01.140" style="s2">ecological economics tries to carry out</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.550" end="00:06:05.410" style="s2">this sort of research agenda we do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.140" end="00:06:09.250" style="s2">by being a transdisciplinary research in</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.970" end="00:06:20.290" style="s2">also trying to transcend these</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.870" end="00:06:32.490" style="s2">moving a larger fraction of the teaching</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.110" end="00:06:36.520" style="s2">into problem-based and service learning</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.490" end="00:06:37.870" style="s2">kinds of courses where we address real</p>
