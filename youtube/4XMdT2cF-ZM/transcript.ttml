<p begin="00:21:47.320" end="00:21:52.710" style="s2">take or channel that hatred to good and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.380" end="00:21:55.480" style="s2">I imagine it affects your family as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.710" end="00:21:57.670" style="s2">well part of it is that I have a pretty</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.670" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">people behind me like my wife is firmly</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.490" end="00:22:17.080" style="s2">I have a good set of friends and also</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.840" end="00:22:19.030" style="s2">generally I try not to talk about things</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.030" end="00:22:26.830" style="s2">also helps yeah so and I&#39;m not impressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.560" end="00:22:28.660" style="s2">with the sorts of ideological positions</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.830" end="00:22:30.220" style="s2">that have been put forth especially by</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:42.070" style="s2">and I feel that whatever vitriol happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:44.350" style="s2">to be directed at me is trivial in terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.070" end="00:22:48.160" style="s2">of its danger in comparison to the</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.160" end="00:22:52.840" style="s2">ideologies are producing and so better</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.010" end="00:22:56.620" style="s2">to do something about it now than to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.840" end="00:22:59.830" style="s2">wait also in a social media world that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.620" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">is dominated by extremism and hatred and</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.210" end="00:23:20.139" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve only seen there was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:22.749" style="s2">debate you did with Stephen Fry where an</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.139" end="00:23:24.429" style="s2">American passed ahead ago and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.749" end="00:23:26.710" style="s2">saw some fire there I think you were</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.429" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">genuinely upset but you seem to have a</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:35.019" style="s2">the ball not the man or woman well that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.950" end="00:23:37.059" style="s2">that debate the Munk debate that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.019" end="00:23:41.499" style="s2">talking about mostly I was upset about</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.059" end="00:23:43.929" style="s2">the foolishness you know the the person</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.499" end="00:23:47.259" style="s2">I was debating with call owed me an</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.929" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">angry white man and it just struck me is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.259" end="00:23:55.179" style="s2">so so rhetorically foolish and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:57.399" style="s2">inflammatory and unnecessary all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.179" end="00:23:59.859" style="s2">those things at the same time first of</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.859" end="00:24:02.980" style="s2">United States and those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.179" end="00:24:05.649" style="s2">statements I actually don&#39;t go over very</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.980" end="00:24:07.509" style="s2">well in Canada and my race had</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.649" end="00:24:09.509" style="s2">absolutely nothing to do with what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.509" end="00:24:12.519" style="s2">were talking about and so it was just</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.509" end="00:24:14.710" style="s2">the kind of troublemaking statement that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.519" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">does nothing but make things worse and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.710" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">I&#39;m never happy when I see people</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:24.789" style="s2">behaving in a manner that only makes</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:27.309" style="s2">things worse and so that that and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.789" end="00:24:29.169" style="s2">even it&#39;s a funny thing I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.309" end="00:24:31.629" style="s2">exactly felt bad for him but I thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.169" end="00:24:33.669" style="s2">it was so foolish of him to undermine</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.629" end="00:24:36.539" style="s2">his own credibility in that manner it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.669" end="00:24:39.609" style="s2">was just the sort of performance that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.539" end="00:24:41.649" style="s2">removes all patience you know a bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.609" end="00:24:44.109" style="s2">rhetorical statement and unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.649" end="00:24:45.869" style="s2">racist comment a rhetorical flourish</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.109" end="00:24:47.859" style="s2">that had nothing but counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.869" end="00:24:51.220" style="s2">consequences as you can see by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.859" end="00:24:53.139" style="s2">YouTube commentary added nothing at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.220" end="00:24:56.019" style="s2">that was productive to the debate didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.139" end="00:24:58.899" style="s2">address the issues at hand was a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.019" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">method of scoring points a way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.899" end="00:25:05.649" style="s2">playing victim I mean it was altogether</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:08.859" style="s2">a second-rate performance and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.649" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">because he had academic pretensions was</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.309" end="00:25:21.759" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to well that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.139" end="00:25:24.429" style="s2">profession I thought Stephen Fry was</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.759" end="00:25:25.860" style="s2">brilliant in that debate and he started</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.429" end="00:25:28.140" style="s2">outside you didn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.860" end="00:25:30.330" style="s2">a lot of what you said but he was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.140" end="00:25:33.000" style="s2">stand next to you and fight you aside</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.330" end="00:25:35.309" style="s2">and he also said the world would be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.000" end="00:25:37.290" style="s2">much better place if everyone was less</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.309" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">convinced of how right they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.290" end="00:25:40.920" style="s2">yeah well Stephen Fry is really</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:43.020" style="s2">something it was a pleasure to meet him</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.920" end="00:25:44.970" style="s2">and he&#39;s he&#39;s quite the remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.020" end="00:25:47.160" style="s2">person so that was one of the very good</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.049" end="00:26:50.910" style="s2">because it was it was a real feat of</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.500" end="00:27:14.780" style="s2">sphere on the negative side for me is</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.600" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">that there&#39;s a list of epithets that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.780" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like all the radical leftists have</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.070" end="00:27:45.720" style="s2">up now and then and the idea seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.009" end="00:27:47.250" style="s2">that if you don&#39;t agree with what</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.720" end="00:27:49.169" style="s2">someone says that you just lay out the</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:05.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s getting downright dull I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.389" end="00:28:07.350" style="s2">mean well I decide that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.700" end="00:28:09.509" style="s2">that liberal journalists throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.350" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">Western world have been lighting up to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.509" end="00:28:15.210" style="s2">try and take you down yeah well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:17.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a fair number of journalists</p>

<p begin="00:28:21.149" end="00:28:26.879" style="s2">the radical left side yes this has been</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.059" end="00:28:29.070" style="s2">happening pretty much non-stop for two</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.879" end="00:28:31.169" style="s2">years and they&#39;re basically out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.070" end="00:28:33.720" style="s2">insults as far as I can tell which in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.169" end="00:28:35.460" style="s2">some sense disarms them but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.720" end="00:28:37.889" style="s2">actually getting rather dull to read</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.460" end="00:28:39.750" style="s2">because it&#39;s always the same old thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.889" end="00:28:41.669" style="s2">although the person you interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.750" end="00:28:44.429" style="s2">yesterday did have a new twist which was</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.379" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t been protests as I understand so</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.179" end="00:29:13.169" style="s2">far in Australia there was a few in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:15.509" style="s2">Adelaide but above 25 and and and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.169" end="00:29:18.590" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t exactly clear what they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.509" end="00:29:22.950" style="s2">protesting they seem to be more</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.950" end="00:29:27.809" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know what that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.860" end="00:29:31.409" style="s2">with me but it had to do with whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.809" end="00:29:33.149" style="s2">they were interested in protesting but</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.409" end="00:29:34.980" style="s2">there was nothing in Melbourne at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.149" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">though there was quite a large police</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:40.259" style="s2">lot of people there was about 5,500</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.299" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">people but there wasn&#39;t a single</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.259" end="00:29:46.889" style="s2">protester and I would say that yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:49.860" style="s2">overall the virulence and also the</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.860" end="00:29:56.250" style="s2">is has declined rather precipitous</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.190" end="00:29:59.460" style="s2">in the last three or four months and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.250" end="00:30:01.590" style="s2">think it&#39;s because well because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.880" end="00:36:22.740" style="s2">and just suggested that they needed to</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.830" end="00:36:34.289" style="s2">suggestion well what&#39;s her racial and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.080" end="00:36:36.749" style="s2">ethnic background just out of curiosity</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.029" end="00:36:44.969" style="s2">to bloody well move aside and let</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.969" end="00:36:51.269" style="s2">position all right so I&#39;m tae key you</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.419" end="00:36:53.099" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with Julie Angeles also look</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.269" end="00:36:55.589" style="s2">they&#39;ve tried this in Scandinavia where</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.099" end="00:36:57.509" style="s2">they put you know they&#39;ve put quotas for</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.589" end="00:36:59.489" style="s2">females on boards and part of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.509" end="00:37:02.219" style="s2">was that if you did that that you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.489" end="00:37:04.380" style="s2">increase the rate at which women would</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.589" end="00:37:17.239" style="s2">Jordan that actually woman can somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.400" end="00:37:20.969" style="s2">up the financial performance of guys</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.239" end="00:37:23.309" style="s2">sure that&#39;s you don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.969" end="00:37:26.479" style="s2">stance there&#39;s no evidence for that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.309" end="00:37:28.919" style="s2">what what what elevates the financial</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.479" end="00:37:31.259" style="s2">productivity of companies is quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.919" end="00:37:33.299" style="s2">trait conscientiousness which is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.259" end="00:37:35.549" style="s2">marker for integrity and trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.299" end="00:37:37.769" style="s2">and diligence ness diligence and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.549" end="00:37:40.769" style="s2">dutifulness is a very good predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.769" end="00:37:43.469" style="s2">long-term economic productivity and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.769" end="00:37:46.829" style="s2">is general cognitive ability and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.469" end="00:37:49.199" style="s2">holds across sexes and races and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.829" end="00:37:52.259" style="s2">reason for that and this is the non</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.199" end="00:37:54.449" style="s2">racist and non sexist way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.259" end="00:37:58.140" style="s2">the world by the way is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.449" end="00:38:00.150" style="s2">far more difference between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.140" end="00:38:02.819" style="s2">within groups than there are between</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.150" end="00:38:07.709" style="s2">groups because look the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.819" end="00:38:09.809" style="s2">racist sexist ethnocentric proposition</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.709" end="00:38:11.729" style="s2">is that there are more differences</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.809" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">between groups of people then there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.729" end="00:38:16.799" style="s2">within groups of people yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:18.809" style="s2">essentially the racist doctrine yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.799" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">so we need some black people because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.809" end="00:38:22.739" style="s2">know all those black people are the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:26.130" style="s2">and unless we have a voice or two from a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.739" end="00:38:32.429" style="s2">black person then we don&#39;t have that set</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.130" end="00:38:35.999" style="s2">of identity issues represented well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.429" end="00:38:37.799" style="s2">just simply not the case because most of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.999" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">the diversity comes at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.799" end="00:38:41.339" style="s2">individual personality in temperament</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.409" style="s2">and the literature on that is crystal</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.339" end="00:38:45.479" style="s2">clear you know these these these are</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.409" end="00:38:47.130" style="s2">pseudo intellectual claims made by</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.479" end="00:38:48.359" style="s2">people on the radical left and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.130" end="00:38:50.670" style="s2">very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.359" end="00:38:52.559" style="s2">because they&#39;re easily shifted into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.670" end="00:38:55.140" style="s2">sorts of things that the radical right</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.559" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">likes to enjoy which is oh I see</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.140" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">there are immutable differences between</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:06.049" style="s2">gender sexes and the races and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:09.390" style="s2">of substantial import and that we we we</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.049" end="00:39:13.529" style="s2">we need to take them into account when</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.390" end="00:39:16.349" style="s2">we&#39;re what would you say formulating</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.529" end="00:39:18.150" style="s2">such things is immigration policy so no</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.349" end="00:39:20.190" style="s2">there&#39;s no evidence that those claims</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.150" end="00:39:22.349" style="s2">are correct and and there&#39;s counter</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.190" end="00:39:25.019" style="s2">evidence for much of it for so example</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.349" end="00:39:27.329" style="s2">in in Scandinavian and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.019" end="00:39:30.529" style="s2">as close to psychological fact as any</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.329" end="00:39:33.900" style="s2">facts that exist is that as you increase</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.529" end="00:39:35.789" style="s2">equality of opportunity which means you</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.900" end="00:39:37.950" style="s2">open the doors for more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.789" end="00:39:40.890" style="s2">and especially let&#39;s say with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.950" end="00:39:42.509" style="s2">sex and and that&#39;s had a big effect</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.890" end="00:39:44.430" style="s2">because of course it&#39;s far more women in</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.509" end="00:39:47.190" style="s2">the workforce than there than there once</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.430" end="00:39:50.130" style="s2">was you increase the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.190" end="00:39:52.349" style="s2">outcomes differ on multiple dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.130" end="00:39:54.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly there&#39;s a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.349" end="00:39:56.730" style="s2">reasons for that at least a dozen and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:58.769" style="s2">they&#39;re all important one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.730" end="00:40:01.980" style="s2">that women especially once they hit</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.769" end="00:40:05.069" style="s2">their 30s prefer to work part time and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.980" end="00:40:07.049" style="s2">that&#39;s not bad or wrong and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.069" end="00:40:10.950" style="s2">certainly not an indication of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.049" end="00:40:13.529" style="s2">sexism so the the radical types like to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.950" end="00:40:16.549" style="s2">have one explanation everyone isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.529" end="00:40:18.749" style="s2">exactly the same with regards to outcome</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.549" end="00:40:21.150" style="s2">therefore the system is a corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.749" end="00:40:23.489" style="s2">patriarchy it&#39;s like you can learn that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.150" end="00:40:25.380" style="s2">in one minute in a in a propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.489" end="00:40:27.660" style="s2">course in university and then you have</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.440" end="00:40:38.910" style="s2">come back to that point the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.269" end="00:40:41.309" style="s2">bill proposed bill we have before our</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.910" end="00:40:43.499" style="s2">parliament is the idea of six</p>

<p begin="00:40:56.190" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">legislation well the first thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.559" end="00:41:01.980" style="s2">say it might be useful to really address</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:03.480" style="s2">some important</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.980" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">problems that would be the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.480" end="00:41:07.950" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with an absolutely tiny</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.030" end="00:41:10.470" style="s2">minority of people not that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.950" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">completely without import but the second</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.470" end="00:41:15.390" style="s2">thing is it has to be thought through</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:19.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s not I mean I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.390" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve been followed we just having a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.350" end="00:41:24.180" style="s2">little hiccup there and we&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:25.619" style="s2">dr. Jordan B Peterson who&#39;s joining us</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.180" end="00:41:27.180" style="s2">from Scott from Sydney Jordan we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.619" end="00:41:29.940" style="s2">talking about sir</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.180" end="00:41:31.650" style="s2">sex self-identification changes or</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.940" end="00:41:34.290" style="s2">proposed reforms and New Zealand you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.650" end="00:41:36.660" style="s2">said fiercely it&#39;s a tiny number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.290" end="00:41:38.840" style="s2">people affected and secondly you say we</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.660" end="00:41:41.490" style="s2">need to think it through and what way</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.840" end="00:41:44.460" style="s2">well one of the things that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.490" end="00:41:47.540" style="s2">for example so really what this is is an</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.460" end="00:41:52.440" style="s2">attempt by a certain ideological</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.540" end="00:41:55.770" style="s2">movement to to put forth the insistence</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.440" end="00:41:57.930" style="s2">that sex is only a sociological</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.770" end="00:42:01.290" style="s2">construct that it&#39;s only something</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.930" end="00:42:03.420" style="s2">learned and so that it can be changed at</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.290" end="00:42:05.070" style="s2">whim which is also a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.420" end="00:42:07.619" style="s2">because if it&#39;s learned it can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.070" end="00:42:09.690" style="s2">be changed at whim and also if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.619" end="00:42:10.770" style="s2">learned it could be unlearned which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:12.930" style="s2">something that the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.770" end="00:42:14.250" style="s2">putting this legislation forward aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.930" end="00:42:17.010" style="s2">really thinking through because that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.250" end="00:42:19.890" style="s2">opens up the opportunity for people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.010" end="00:42:22.859" style="s2">would like to reform people who would</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.890" end="00:42:24.930" style="s2">like to change their gender back to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.859" end="00:42:27.270" style="s2">normative behavior because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.930" end="00:42:29.970" style="s2">learned it can be unlearned but more</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.270" end="00:42:32.700" style="s2">importantly sex roles are not only</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.970" end="00:42:35.070" style="s2">learned they&#39;re partly learned and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.700" end="00:42:37.710" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of biological differences</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.070" end="00:42:39.570" style="s2">between men and women and then and many</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.710" end="00:42:41.310" style="s2">of them aren&#39;t trivial like men and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.570" end="00:42:43.530" style="s2">women are more the same than they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.310" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">different but the differences are quite</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.530" end="00:42:48.450" style="s2">market at the extremes and so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:51.540" style="s2">seeing partly as a consequence of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.450" end="00:42:54.090" style="s2">now is the movement of say trans women</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.540" end="00:42:55.770" style="s2">into female sports you saw this in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.090" end="00:43:00.990" style="s2">Minnesota just the other day I think it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.770" end="00:43:04.260" style="s2">was Minnesota where a newly transition</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.990" end="00:43:07.080" style="s2">trans woman has been shattering though</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.260" end="00:43:09.570" style="s2">weightlifting records for women and more</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.570" end="00:43:15.180" style="s2">Games competitor it was a former model</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.440" end="00:43:17.610" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely insane</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.180" end="00:43:19.560" style="s2">you know I mean first the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.610" end="00:43:21.210" style="s2">allowed to begin with is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.560" end="00:43:24.110" style="s2">comprehension it&#39;s a real sign of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.210" end="00:43:25.530" style="s2">cultural insanity and the second is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.110" end="00:43:29.010" style="s2">psychologically it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.530" end="00:43:32.940" style="s2">incomprehensible I can&#39;t imagine how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.010" end="00:43:34.980" style="s2">could be a man who transformed himself</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.940" end="00:43:37.790" style="s2">into a woman in all the ways that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.980" end="00:43:41.730" style="s2">possible and then decided to go compete</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.790" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">in it high level sports arena with women</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.730" end="00:43:46.350" style="s2">who&#39;ve been training their whole lives</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:49.770" style="s2">to hit the peak of their ability and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.350" end="00:43:52.290" style="s2">then to absolutely bloody demolish them</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.770" end="00:43:55.050" style="s2">say after a year of work and then to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.290" end="00:43:57.480" style="s2">tout that as some sort of victory for</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.050" end="00:44:00.090" style="s2">the oppressed it&#39;s completely what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.480" end="00:44:03.450" style="s2">narcissistic beyond comprehension and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.090" end="00:44:06.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s well it&#39;s a sign of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.450" end="00:44:08.760" style="s2">happens when you don&#39;t carefully think</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.090" end="00:44:11.160" style="s2">things through all sorts of unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.760" end="00:44:13.170" style="s2">consequences tend to manifest themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.160" end="00:44:15.750" style="s2">and you see the same thing happening now</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.170" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">with rapid onset gender dysphoria and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.750" end="00:44:20.790" style="s2">the treatment of very young people with</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:23.670" style="s2">very powerful hormonal and surgical</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.790" end="00:44:25.590" style="s2">techniques designed to permanently alter</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.590" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">like we&#39;re gonna pay for this in a big</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.200" end="00:44:34.260" style="s2">way in 15 years when these kids grow up</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:36.450" style="s2">and hit adulthood and start tossing out</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.260" end="00:44:38.490" style="s2">lawsuits as they certainly will and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.450" end="00:44:40.440" style="s2">should where we&#39;re going to look back</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.490" end="00:44:43.590" style="s2">and wonder just exactly what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.440" end="00:44:46.460" style="s2">was wrong with us so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.590" end="00:44:48.990" style="s2">well it&#39;s Jen I&#39;ve been by this ideology</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.460" end="00:44:51.120" style="s2">that that&#39;s been formulated by people</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.990" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">like Judith Butler who absolutely insist</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.120" end="00:44:55.350" style="s2">because they have no biological</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:09.360" style="s2">this country and indeed everywhere we</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.840" end="00:45:10.890" style="s2">look at the millennial generation they</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.360" end="00:45:13.410" style="s2">get a bit of stick here they called</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.890" end="00:45:15.450" style="s2">snowflakes they seem to get outraged not</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.410" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">only on their own behalf but on behalf</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.450" end="00:45:20.910" style="s2">of others at the drop of a hat and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.460" style="s2">use social media as elsewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.910" end="00:45:26.850" style="s2">world to call out the things they find</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.460" end="00:45:28.890" style="s2">offensive or that their feelings do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.850" end="00:45:31.320" style="s2">think there is a collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.890" end="00:45:36.630" style="s2">generational psychosis appearing because</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.320" end="00:45:39.060" style="s2">of social media I don&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.630" end="00:45:41.430" style="s2">millennial generation is any less sane</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.060" end="00:45:43.410" style="s2">than the baby boomers I mean the baby</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.430" end="00:45:45.830" style="s2">boomers have plenty of trouble and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.410" end="00:45:49.170" style="s2">cause plenty of grief and misery in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.830" end="00:45:51.150" style="s2">1960s and experimented you know crazily</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.170" end="00:45:54.120" style="s2">with psychedelic drugs and a wild</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.150" end="00:45:56.490" style="s2">lifestyle and promiscuous sex and all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.120" end="00:45:58.710" style="s2">those things and I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.490" end="00:46:02.670" style="s2">Millennials are any worse or any better</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.710" end="00:46:06.180" style="s2">I do think that there is a small subset</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.670" end="00:46:09.270" style="s2">of them who are rather dependent and</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.050" end="00:46:21.480" style="s2">to make the most of their victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.600" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">feelings and status and I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.480" end="00:46:29.850" style="s2">the social media platforms also allow</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:32.310" style="s2">for disproportionate effect of social</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.850" end="00:46:34.890" style="s2">effect of people who have extreme views</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.890" end="00:46:40.140" style="s2">the increasing death of the of the</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.140" end="00:46:44.730" style="s2">increasingly desperate for attention and</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.730" end="00:50:26.770" style="s2">but your book I guess it&#39;s the adoption</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.240" end="00:50:29.590" style="s2">of personal responsibility more than</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.770" end="00:50:32.380" style="s2">anything else and and the more</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.590" end="00:50:33.970" style="s2">responsibility I take on the more I find</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.380" end="00:50:35.350" style="s2">I&#39;m able to and the more unable to get</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.260" end="00:51:52.270" style="s2">I was in a very very very dark place and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.680" end="00:51:55.060" style="s2">somehow I found you online</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.270" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know folks through Dave Rubin or</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.060" end="00:52:01.540" style="s2">or whether Shapiro or or I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:03.670" style="s2">sure how it happened but I&#39;ve seen your</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.540" end="00:52:07.510" style="s2">lectures of this until it you met of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.670" end="00:52:09.670" style="s2">meaning your lectures on Genesis and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.510" end="00:52:13.420" style="s2">it&#39;s just been a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.670" end="00:52:15.730" style="s2">in my life in my family&#39;s life and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.420" end="00:52:17.829" style="s2">just want to say thank you hey man I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.730" end="00:52:20.200" style="s2">thrilled to hear it so do you do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.829" end="00:52:23.890" style="s2">have any sense of what in particular did</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.200" end="00:52:27.460" style="s2">it like what was it that struck you like</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.890" end="00:52:29.470" style="s2">I think it it was just the pistol way</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.460" end="00:52:32.530" style="s2">that you spoke and it was just such</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.470" end="00:52:35.770" style="s2">plain English it was as you described</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.530" end="00:52:38.109" style="s2">previously there was some rules are sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.770" end="00:52:40.089" style="s2">of sort of cliches but they&#39;ve they</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.109" end="00:52:43.809" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been spoken of in a very long</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.089" end="00:52:46.020" style="s2">time and it was as the previous quality</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.809" end="00:52:50.530" style="s2">of the Professional Responsibility the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.020" end="00:52:54.220" style="s2">the taking care of oneself and it just</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.530" end="00:52:55.420" style="s2">struck such a chord it was I knew some</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.220" end="00:52:58.329" style="s2">of the things that you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.420" end="00:53:00.790" style="s2">I&#39;d heard them before but I hadn&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.329" end="00:53:02.230" style="s2">them in a very long time my father used</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.790" end="00:53:04.390" style="s2">to say yeah strike with your shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.230" end="00:53:06.040" style="s2">back and and finally there it was again</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.390" end="00:53:08.470" style="s2">but it was being said in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.040" end="00:53:11.109" style="s2">in it yeah well the thing is you need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.470" end="00:53:12.579" style="s2">know why that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.109" end="00:53:14.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what I tried to do with my</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.579" end="00:53:16.630" style="s2">lectures and partly because I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.500" end="00:53:19.809" style="s2">behavioral psychologist it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.630" end="00:53:21.790" style="s2">have all these more rules and and people</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.809" end="00:53:24.420" style="s2">are told the rules but they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.790" end="00:53:26.470" style="s2">seldom given a multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.420" end="00:53:29.500" style="s2">explanation of why the rules are</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.470" end="00:53:31.030" style="s2">necessary you know it&#39;s well you should</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.500" end="00:53:32.770" style="s2">do it because that&#39;s what people do or</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.030" end="00:53:34.109" style="s2">that&#39;s because you know that&#39;s what good</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.770" end="00:53:37.420" style="s2">people do or it&#39;s your responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.109" end="00:53:40.450" style="s2">and all those things are true but it be</p>

<p begin="00:53:40.450" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s related to the responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:47.980" style="s2">gives your life meaning and also</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">improves the world your family and the</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:54.130" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.339" end="00:53:56.470" style="s2">provide and it is clear and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.130" end="00:53:59.890" style="s2">in English as clear as I could manage it</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.470" end="00:54:01.809" style="s2">and so you know it I&#39;ve tried to make it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.890" end="00:54:04.599" style="s2">practical and useful for people and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.809" end="00:54:06.940" style="s2">really very very happy to hear that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:14.200" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">doing yeah hello yeah hello how are you</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.480" end="00:54:26.460" style="s2">doing Peter very very well hey have you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">in a moment of self-reflection had a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.460" end="00:54:32.610" style="s2">look back on on this amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:34.410" style="s2">astounding following you created and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.610" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">wondered where it&#39;s going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.410" end="00:54:39.150" style="s2">because at the risk of sounding</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:40.800" style="s2">oxymoronic you&#39;re probably the closest</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.150" end="00:54:46.710" style="s2">thing the secular humanist tears to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.800" end="00:54:49.380" style="s2">messiah well I thought about that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.710" end="00:54:51.300" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say precisely in those terms I</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.380" end="00:54:54.060" style="s2">mean one of the things I did learn from</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.300" end="00:54:55.770" style="s2">studying Carl Jung years ago was that if</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.060" end="00:54:58.350" style="s2">you&#39;re going to talk about archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.770" end="00:55:01.020" style="s2">stories which I do all the time that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.350" end="00:55:03.660" style="s2">have to be very careful not to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.020" end="00:55:06.180" style="s2">yourself with the archetype you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.660" end="00:55:09.300" style="s2">so I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m very cognizant of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.180" end="00:55:11.880" style="s2">danger of the kind of popularity that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.300" end="00:55:13.940" style="s2">I&#39;m experiencing and and I do mean the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.880" end="00:55:16.800" style="s2">danger because the higher you fly the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.940" end="00:55:18.660" style="s2">faster you can fall and and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.800" end="00:55:22.700" style="s2">be very careful to ensure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.660" end="00:55:25.530" style="s2">not increasing the probability of that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.700" end="00:55:27.980" style="s2">try to make sure that I credit other</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.530" end="00:55:30.660" style="s2">people with many of the ideas that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.980" end="00:55:32.760" style="s2">formulated and because I&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.660" end="00:55:35.160" style="s2">lot from reading the great clinicians</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.760" end="00:55:37.230" style="s2">and and philosophers of the last say</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.160" end="00:55:39.750" style="s2">hundred and fifty years and from my</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.230" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">clinical practice and so on and so and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.750" end="00:55:45.090" style="s2">think of this endeavor not as something</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:47.220" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing but as something that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.090" end="00:55:50.220" style="s2">we&#39;re all collectively engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.220" end="00:55:52.770" style="s2">because I know that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.220" end="00:55:55.080" style="s2">there&#39;s an old idea that every person is</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.770" end="00:55:56.850" style="s2">a center of the world and that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.080" end="00:56:00.150" style="s2">weight of the world for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.850" end="00:56:02.700" style="s2">weighs upon the shoulders of each person</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.150" end="00:56:05.270" style="s2">and I really believe that&#39;s true and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.700" end="00:56:08.280" style="s2">if you know that then it keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.270" end="00:56:11.160" style="s2">egotism and the arrogance down partly</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.280" end="00:56:13.380" style="s2">out of sheer terror and it makes it much</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.160" end="00:56:15.600" style="s2">more effective to deal with people like</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.380" end="00:56:18.150" style="s2">when I&#39;m lecturing in front of an</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.600" end="00:56:20.520" style="s2">audience I&#39;m not lecturing to them you</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.150" end="00:56:22.550" style="s2">know I&#39;m lecturing with them talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.520" end="00:56:25.500" style="s2">about problems that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.550" end="00:56:27.840" style="s2">including me and aims that we all all</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.500" end="00:56:30.030" style="s2">need to develop including me and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.840" end="00:56:31.920" style="s2">have to include yourself so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.030" end="00:56:33.960" style="s2">among the sinners and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.920" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">reprehensible types in order to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.960" end="00:56:37.380" style="s2">communicate with people properly and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:40.620" style="s2">do my best to in</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.380" end="00:56:43.170" style="s2">sure that I&#39;m starkly aware of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.620" end="00:56:46.800" style="s2">shortcomings and faults at every moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.170" end="00:56:49.020" style="s2">I can possibly manage and I have family</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.800" end="00:56:51.630" style="s2">and friends who also help keep what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.020" end="00:56:53.400" style="s2">doing in check and and to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.630" end="00:56:55.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not going sideways in some manner</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.400" end="00:56:57.270" style="s2">that&#39;s you know where I&#39;m taking things</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.290" end="00:57:00.030" style="s2">for granted or becoming arrogant or any</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.270" end="00:57:03.800" style="s2">of that and so so far that&#39;s worked out</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.030" end="00:57:07.980" style="s2">well and hopefully it will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.800" end="00:57:10.850" style="s2">JA welcome to the program oh hi Joe</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.980" end="00:57:13.770" style="s2">thanks for talking with me Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.850" end="00:57:16.110" style="s2">all right sure how are you doing good</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.770" end="00:57:19.650" style="s2">thank you so I&#39;m a young academic in New</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.110" end="00:57:21.720" style="s2">Zealand and one of the problems were one</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.650" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">of the obsessions I would say we have in</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.720" end="00:57:30.450" style="s2">universities is a focus on race and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:33.660" style="s2">gender so I&#39;m I would call a centrist</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.450" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">position somewhat liberal minded but</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.660" end="00:57:39.870" style="s2">what advice would you give a young</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:41.700" style="s2">academic pushing against the what I see</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.870" end="00:57:45.570" style="s2">is the far less the gender of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.700" end="00:57:47.430" style="s2">universities well the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.570" end="00:57:50.340" style="s2">would say is they&#39;re a lot more moderate</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.430" end="00:57:52.380" style="s2">types of your sort than you think and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.340" end="00:57:54.690" style="s2">if you&#39;re a careful person and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.380" end="00:57:57.240" style="s2">thinking things through and you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.690" end="00:57:59.940" style="s2">things to object to you can be sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.240" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">virtually sure that a majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.940" end="00:58:09.330" style="s2">agree with you even though they&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:11.730" style="s2">cowed let&#39;s say to to speak up I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.330" end="00:58:13.740" style="s2">say get your thoughts in order you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.730" end="00:58:16.620" style="s2">so you know what you stand for and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.740" end="00:58:18.540" style="s2">I would also say don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.620" end="00:58:21.270" style="s2">anything that you don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.540" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">because all that&#39;ll happen and you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.270" end="00:58:27.110" style="s2">young academic all that will happen if</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:30.420" style="s2">you compromise your intellectual soul</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.110" end="00:58:32.990" style="s2">like increment by increment over the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.420" end="00:58:36.170" style="s2">next ten years is that you will end up</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.990" end="00:58:38.610" style="s2">alcoholic and bitter hating your job</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.170" end="00:58:42.390" style="s2">despised by your undergraduates and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.610" end="00:58:44.730" style="s2">absolutely sick of your existence and</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.390" end="00:58:47.070" style="s2">like you got to keep that really firmly</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.730" end="00:58:49.380" style="s2">in mind because every time you&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.070" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">upon to stand forth for something you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.380" end="00:58:53.989" style="s2">believe in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:56.509" style="s2">it&#39;s a test of character and courage and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.989" end="00:58:58.819" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to put it off because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.509" end="00:59:00.920" style="s2">lot of trouble you know it&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.920" end="00:59:04.940" style="s2">really have to go through with this I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.479" end="00:59:07.220" style="s2">got other things to do and if the answer</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.940" end="00:59:09.859" style="s2">is well I better stand up for what I</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.220" end="00:59:12.229" style="s2">believe in now because if I keep letting</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.859" end="00:59:14.450" style="s2">it go increment by increment for the</p>

<p begin="01:00:05.210" end="01:00:11.089" style="s2">and I totally agree because we live in a</p>

<p begin="01:00:12.619" end="01:00:18.140" style="s2">that but particularly today in our</p>
