<p begin="00:00:12.090" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">host Eric Weinstein and I&#39;m here today</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">with my guest David Wolpe who was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:19.470" style="s2">rabbi of Sinai temple here in Los</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:22.230" style="s2">Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">David is often thought to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.230" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">most influential rabbis currently in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">United States has been named so by</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">Newsweek and finds himself in various</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.680" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">so you and I improbably met in Belgrade</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">Serbia yes exactly and we shared a bus</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">sorry and that bus ride has been on my</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:49.140" style="s2">mind in a way that it probably hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">been in playing through your mind but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.140" end="00:00:56.420" style="s2">wondered if we might begin this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">by deciding that we would avoid certain</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.420" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">well-worn tropes I don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:04.890" style="s2">into does God exist or doesn&#39;t he right</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">and the question that I want to begin</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.890" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">with is for our listeners who have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:15.320" style="s2">searching for some kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">outlet but are also frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.320" end="00:01:22.520" style="s2">being very analytic intellectual in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">oriented what is that God versus no God</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.520" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">conversation crowding out that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">be more present in the public dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">that is its that is a wonderful question</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">and I think that the the pot what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:42.950" style="s2">public dialogue really needs very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">desperately is how do you create</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.950" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">community and interdependence that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:53.369" style="s2">people take seriously and is lifelong in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">the absence of some particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.369" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">transcendent belief and and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">that&#39;s that is the most valuable thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">that religion gives its adherents and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:09.959" style="s2">it&#39;s even more valuable in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">than personal meaning because you and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.959" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">both know that that religion used to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.660" style="s2">think it had a monopoly on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">possibility of personal meaning but a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.660" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">lot of people live their lives without a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">religious sense and would not say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">their lives are meaningless but they do</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">need community and community especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">in such an atomized age and especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:36.989" style="s2">in modern America is very hard to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">and to find and this transcendent share</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.989" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">transcendent idea gives you community</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:44.580" style="s2">but in that absence I don&#39;t know how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">construct it but that doesn&#39;t mean there</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.580" end="00:02:49.769" style="s2">isn&#39;t a way we we need to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">do that or at least to start talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.769" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">about it and one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:02:55.890" style="s2">would hope is that people in religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:02:57.569" style="s2">communities and people outside of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.890" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">religious commune should talk about to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.569" end="00:03:04.910" style="s2">that and how to do it without letting</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:08.299" style="s2">specific beliefs wreck the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.910" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">so this is always tricky for me because</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.299" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">we have these various concepts to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:17.069" style="s2">keep our religion and our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">belief separate right we have questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.069" end="00:03:21.720" style="s2">about should I abstract what was</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:25.950" style="s2">previously concrete so that it remains</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.720" end="00:03:28.109" style="s2">relevant in my current life and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:30.329" style="s2">always feels to be a bit of a cheat in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.109" end="00:03:33.769" style="s2">all of this yet if we don&#39;t make these</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.329" end="00:03:37.019" style="s2">kind of cheats or half measures or</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.769" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">accommodations we find very</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.019" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">uncomfortable outcome which is that most</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:43.769" style="s2">of these religions had their ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">texts written well before we had as much</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.769" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">detail as we currently do about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">scientific world and we&#39;re happiest</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.989" style="s2">where they were abstract and we&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:55.910" style="s2">troubled where they were concrete it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.989" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">true look there&#39;s a lot of passages that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.910" end="00:04:03.329" style="s2">in in my own tradition that I explained</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:05.390" style="s2">exactly the way you do which is this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.329" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">the creation of an ancient culture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.390" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">and there are things about it that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:13.799" style="s2">have grown beyond and and I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">problem saying that although many of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.799" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">co-religionists would hate the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">a rabbi would say that but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:26.770" style="s2">a problem saying that however the result</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.770" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">the result of adherence to things that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:37.509" style="s2">find objectionable I find admirable in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.060" end="00:04:40.120" style="s2">other words there are communities who</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.509" end="00:04:41.650" style="s2">believe things let&#39;s forget Judaism for</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.120" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">a minute forget my own community all</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.650" end="00:04:45.780" style="s2">right there are other communities that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:49.660" style="s2">believe things that I think are</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.780" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">objectively either untrue or just wild</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.660" end="00:04:54.550" style="s2">or even I can&#39;t imagine how someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:56.199" style="s2">could believe that and yet they lead</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.550" end="00:04:58.090" style="s2">admirable lives and have admirable</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.199" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">communities and have values that I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.090" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">most of us would share there may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.220" end="00:05:04.630" style="s2">add-ons that we wouldn&#39;t but they</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:10.650" style="s2">managed to do that and so the question</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.630" end="00:05:14.909" style="s2">is is it possible to create responsible</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.650" end="00:05:18.280" style="s2">interdependent communities without those</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.909" end="00:05:20.289" style="s2">kinds of beliefs I I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.280" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">answered that question yet but I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.289" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming more and more urgent so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:27.970" style="s2">think we should just say something a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">little bit about our own intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.970" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">backgrounds now I think the last time we</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:36.820" style="s2">were together in Serbia I let you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:39.729" style="s2">that I really identify as an atheist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.820" end="00:05:42.509" style="s2">what&#39;s more my family has somehow been</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.729" end="00:05:45.940" style="s2">atheistic for four or five generations</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.509" end="00:05:49.270" style="s2">yet always with Jews marrying other Jews</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.940" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">in keeping Jewish traditions going and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.270" end="00:05:54.669" style="s2">shared with you a mystery in my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.620" style="s2">which is that of all of the five or six</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.669" end="00:05:58.990" style="s2">rabbis that I&#39;ve gotten to know well</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:06:02.259" style="s2">enough to ask the question do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.990" end="00:06:05.469" style="s2">believe in the God of the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.259" end="00:06:08.289" style="s2">as is literally talked about none of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.469" end="00:06:11.110" style="s2">them reform conservative or even</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.289" end="00:06:16.599" style="s2">Orthodox believe that that character</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.110" end="00:06:18.130" style="s2">actually exists so there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.599" end="00:06:20.650" style="s2">at least two things to say but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.130" end="00:06:22.690" style="s2">start with two one is for those of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.650" end="00:06:25.210" style="s2">listeners who are Christian or who grew</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.690" end="00:06:27.669" style="s2">up with no belief but in in a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.210" end="00:06:30.520" style="s2">not not in a Jewish context this may be</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.669" end="00:06:33.219" style="s2">a mystery that I can unravel how someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.520" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">could be a fifth-generation Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.219" end="00:06:39.820" style="s2">atheist because Judaism is not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:40.660" style="s2">religion Christianity is a religion in</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">the podcast I don&#39;t believe any of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.780" end="00:06:57.130" style="s2">anymore I&#39;m still Jewish and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">because Judaism is a category that</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.770" end="00:07:30.430" style="s2">unless you choose another family you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.500" end="00:07:35.500" style="s2">part of that family</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.430" end="00:07:38.350" style="s2">and so Jews have forever I&#39;m at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.500" end="00:07:39.790" style="s2">for a long time without leaving and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.350" end="00:07:41.290" style="s2">going to another religion at which point</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.790" end="00:07:43.300" style="s2">they&#39;re effectively written out of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.290" end="00:07:44.620" style="s2">Jewish forget what Jewish law says</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.300" end="00:07:46.600" style="s2">they&#39;re effectively written out of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.620" end="00:07:47.590" style="s2">Jewish community they&#39;ve said look I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.600" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">don&#39;t believe this that or the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.590" end="00:07:57.100" style="s2">thing and they&#39;re still Jewish so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">why Jewish atheist is not in fact I will</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.100" end="00:08:05.290" style="s2">tell you a story several years ago I had</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.590" end="00:08:06.880" style="s2">to give through someone that I knew it</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.290" end="00:08:08.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter this how I got there I</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.880" end="00:08:12.610" style="s2">was supposed to give a blessing at Carl</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.590" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">Reiner&#39;s 90th birthday party so I get up</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.610" end="00:08:16.630" style="s2">and I start to give a blessing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:18.250" style="s2">somebody calls out from the audience why</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.630" end="00:08:18.900" style="s2">is there a rabbi here Reiner is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.250" end="00:08:23.050" style="s2">atheist</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">so he said Mel Brooks no it could have</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.050" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">been but it wasn&#39;t actually he runs up</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:29.350" style="s2">to state to the stage stands next to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:31.570" style="s2">and says I&#39;m not an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.350" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">I&#39;m a Jewish atheist and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.570" end="00:08:37.870" style="s2">different and he&#39;s right because there</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.810" end="00:08:39.190" style="s2">is a culture to adhere to Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.870" end="00:08:41.979" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that kind of comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.190" end="00:08:44.830" style="s2">culture which makes and here are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.979" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">advantages and disadvantages it makes</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.830" end="00:08:49.870" style="s2">Christianity much more portable because</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:52.300" style="s2">you can keep your culture in every way</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.870" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">so you can go to the Congo you can have</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.300" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">a completely different culture but if</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:58.300" style="s2">you believe in Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">my work here is done but Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.300" end="00:09:04.230" style="s2">especially because of Jewish law it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">many more cultural implications and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.230" end="00:09:09.070" style="s2">therefore the advantage of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:12.220" style="s2">is that it&#39;s portable the advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.070" end="00:09:14.050" style="s2">Judaism is that it&#39;s familial so when</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.220" end="00:09:16.150" style="s2">the Soviet Union was persecuting Jews</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.050" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">back in the 70s and 80s they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.150" end="00:09:20.860" style="s2">persecuting Christians too but there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">no worldwide Christian movement to save</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.860" end="00:09:25.480" style="s2">Christians but there was a worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.690" end="00:09:27.250" style="s2">Jewish movement to save Jews because</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.480" end="00:09:29.020" style="s2">there was that sense of familial I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.250" end="00:09:31.510" style="s2">always wondered why we put up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.020" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">Christian persecution well I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.510" end="00:09:34.960" style="s2">part of the reason is because there</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:37.690" style="s2">isn&#39;t that oh my god that&#39;s my brother</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.960" end="00:09:38.530" style="s2">or sister being persecuted on the part</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.690" end="00:09:43.170" style="s2">of Christians</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.530" end="00:09:47.170" style="s2">it&#39;s whereas for Jews there is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.170" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">adaptive tribal behavior so both of both</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.170" end="00:09:50.350" style="s2">systems have their strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">weaknesses right but they are different</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.350" end="00:09:55.660" style="s2">well and then there&#39;s the very weird</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:59.620" style="s2">aspect that I believe that in large</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.660" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">measure what we are as Jews rides on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.620" end="00:10:06.610" style="s2">Christian substrate that if you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.740" end="00:10:10.620" style="s2">about Christianity is our like one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.610" end="00:10:13.990" style="s2">our two main spin-offs right yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.620" end="00:10:16.930" style="s2">American Judaism really in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.990" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">benefits by riding on the substrate that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.930" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">it&#39;s spin-off developed and being</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">something of a counterweight but also is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:25.870" style="s2">showing some sort of relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:27.010" style="s2">that is that I think that&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.870" end="00:10:30.340" style="s2">fair and I think that look what</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.010" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">Christianity gave to the world that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.340" end="00:10:36.370" style="s2">Judaism and and Islam could not and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:39.010" style="s2">have a I have an explanation for why</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.370" end="00:10:40.570" style="s2">that is is the invaluable gift among</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.010" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">many other things I mean I don&#39;t mean to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.570" end="00:10:44.380" style="s2">restrict Christianity&#39;s cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">contributions to this but among many</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.380" end="00:10:49.450" style="s2">other things it gave the separation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:52.210" style="s2">church and state yeah that was a news</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.450" end="00:10:54.430" style="s2">huge and Jews couldn&#39;t have done it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.210" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">and and and Muslims couldn&#39;t have done</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.430" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">it and the reason I believe this is my</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:03.100" style="s2">theory but it sounds really sound is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.360" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">Christianity arose in the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.100" end="00:11:07.640" style="s2">so civil law literally yes render unto</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:09.430" style="s2">Caesar</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.640" end="00:11:12.200" style="s2">actually the civil law was taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.430" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">but if you&#39;re creating religion as</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.200" end="00:11:18.400" style="s2">Muhammad and Moses did in the desert you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">need civil law and religious law alike</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.400" end="00:11:24.620" style="s2">so Islam and Judaism didn&#39;t make that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:27.170" style="s2">distinction between civil and religious</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.620" end="00:11:31.430" style="s2">law Christianity had to because he grew</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.170" end="00:11:32.780" style="s2">up in Rome and so we that gift that has</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.430" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">been given us has been given us by</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.780" end="00:11:37.880" style="s2">Christians well and so you immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:40.490" style="s2">get to a very dangerous and also very</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.880" end="00:11:43.490" style="s2">interesting area which is the unbundling</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.490" end="00:11:46.010" style="s2">of a religion so when you ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.490" end="00:11:47.900" style="s2">about what is a religion and you say</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.010" end="00:11:50.180" style="s2">well it&#39;s a certain amount of it as is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.900" end="00:11:52.190" style="s2">faith certain amount of it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.180" end="00:11:54.380" style="s2">with technical explanations for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.190" end="00:11:55.970" style="s2">world around you certain amount of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.380" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">has to do with law and you can break</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">that up into the civil and criminal</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.560" end="00:12:04.730" style="s2">another thing that we were dancing</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.300" end="00:12:07.220" style="s2">around is is the Judaism is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.730" end="00:12:08.960" style="s2">a breeding protocol there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.220" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">strange moment when you sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.960" end="00:12:13.580" style="s2">23andme and you spit into the tube and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:16.070" style="s2">it you get a result that tells you had</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.580" end="00:12:17.750" style="s2">Jewish you are now you know I have I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.070" end="00:12:19.820" style="s2">have Chinese friends or you know holed</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.750" end="00:12:22.510" style="s2">up there the results that says look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.820" end="00:12:26.930" style="s2">128th Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.510" end="00:12:29.750" style="s2">likewise for me I was I was almost and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.930" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">just didn&#39;t anticipate being told that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.750" end="00:12:38.510" style="s2">was plus 98% Jewish as part of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:40.430" style="s2">genetic information and so ok so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.510" end="00:12:42.050" style="s2">start to bundle all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.430" end="00:12:43.490" style="s2">together and then you have this very</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.050" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">weird question this goes back to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.490" end="00:12:47.090" style="s2">little bit of Sam Harris&#39;s struggle</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.650" end="00:12:50.450" style="s2">where he says not all religions are</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.090" end="00:12:52.340" style="s2">created equal we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.450" end="00:12:54.620" style="s2">uncomfortable treatment of religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.340" end="00:12:55.670" style="s2">where we pretend not to unbundle that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.620" end="00:12:59.300" style="s2">means we don&#39;t want to be judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.670" end="00:13:01.370" style="s2">right but you can qualitatively say this</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.300" end="00:13:02.090" style="s2">this religion has a legal structure this</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.370" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.090" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">right this legal structure is attenuated</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:09.050" style="s2">in Judaism the way that we get out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:11.480" style="s2">this law I mean let&#39;s be honest about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.050" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">some problems that we have Deuteronomy</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.480" end="00:13:19.220" style="s2">says something like if somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.850" style="s2">worship ancestors that are not known to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.220" end="00:13:23.490" style="s2">our Father set upon them with us</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.850" end="00:13:24.690" style="s2">stone yeah there&#39;s some harsh there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.490" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">some harsh things in the Hebrew Bible</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.690" end="00:13:31.079" style="s2">well right and it&#39;s been very important</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:34.230" style="s2">and I struggle with how to say this I</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.079" end="00:13:36.149" style="s2">always find a biological analogy with</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.230" end="00:13:38.519" style="s2">regulated expression there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.149" end="00:13:40.620" style="s2">portions of the Jewish code that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.519" end="00:13:42.660" style="s2">important that we not run in modern</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.620" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">times it&#39;s not clear that that ever ran</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.660" end="00:13:48.149" style="s2">so far as I know the Jewish stonings of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:50.279" style="s2">apostates right but the way we get out</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.149" end="00:13:51.810" style="s2">of it as we say as long as the temple</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.279" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t built we can&#39;t convene the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.810" end="00:13:55.980" style="s2">religious courts that would meet out the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:57.300" style="s2">punishment and therefore nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.980" end="00:13:59.370" style="s2">actually gonna get prosecuted or</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.300" end="00:14:03.690" style="s2">something like so yeah well when you say</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.370" end="00:14:06.269" style="s2">we not you and I that&#39;s the waste a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.690" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">traditional understanding might get out</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.269" end="00:14:10.220" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:12.449" style="s2">some things by the way we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.220" end="00:14:17.190" style="s2">effectively eliminated by the rabbi&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.449" end="00:14:19.259" style="s2">the Talmud too high an oral torah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.190" end="00:14:20.310" style="s2">well as a writer an oral torah as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.259" end="00:14:22.139" style="s2">as a written will say with that world</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.310" end="00:14:24.810" style="s2">tour is because that might not right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.139" end="00:14:26.250" style="s2">judy you can be a jewish literalist but</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.810" end="00:14:28.110" style="s2">you can&#39;t be a jewish fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.250" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">because a fundamentalist by definition</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.110" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">thinks all the answers are in a plain</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.810" style="s2">reading of the text and judaism never</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">believed in a plain reading of the text</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.810" end="00:14:39.329" style="s2">it always said the Torah means the tower</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:41.759" style="s2">here being the Hebrew Bible the Torah</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.329" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">means what the rabbi&#39;s say the Torah</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.759" end="00:14:47.850" style="s2">means and sometimes their readings sound</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:50.610" style="s2">to us very forced very creative very</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.850" end="00:14:54.839" style="s2">open and expansive sometimes restrictive</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">depending but no rabbi will ever say</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.839" end="00:14:58.649" style="s2">when you come to them just go home the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:02.069" style="s2">answers all in the Torah it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.649" end="00:15:04.649" style="s2">tradition so Judaism is an exegetical</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.069" end="00:15:07.139" style="s2">tradition and therefore a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.649" end="00:15:08.970" style="s2">over time get interpreted out of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.139" end="00:15:12.449" style="s2">tradition and that&#39;s legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.970" end="00:15:15.029" style="s2">that&#39;s not considered like how could you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.449" end="00:15:18.389" style="s2">make that move that&#39;s not okay it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.029" end="00:15:19.589" style="s2">legal tradition and therefore things get</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.389" end="00:15:22.470" style="s2">changed along the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.589" end="00:15:25.850" style="s2">now like any legal tradition it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.470" end="00:15:29.459" style="s2">elastic boundaries but they snap</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.850" end="00:15:31.290" style="s2">unlike rabbis who would say call</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.459" end="00:15:33.029" style="s2">themselves on the right wing of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:34.050" style="s2">Orthodoxy what I would say is modernity</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.029" end="00:15:37.320" style="s2">is a snap</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.050" end="00:15:40.110" style="s2">the tradition and so there are things</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.320" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">that I don&#39;t believe intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.110" end="00:15:47.010" style="s2">honestly I can say that the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.420" end="00:15:51.329" style="s2">endorses but I nonetheless endorse them</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.010" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">and and the example the best example</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.329" end="00:15:56.339" style="s2">that I can give is gay marriage I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:16:00.089" style="s2">that some of my colleagues have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.339" end="00:16:05.370" style="s2">read gay marriage into the sources I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.089" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">think it&#39;s forced beyond what you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.370" end="00:16:14.550" style="s2">actually legitimately try no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:16.740" style="s2">acrobatic your exegetical skills my</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.550" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">answer is that we see the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:19.620" style="s2">differently and we shouldn&#39;t deny that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.160" style="s2">we see the world differently and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.620" end="00:16:26.640" style="s2">question is how do you create a modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.160" end="00:16:29.940" style="s2">Judaism that is authentically modern not</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.640" end="00:16:33.800" style="s2">just that is in full fidelity to sources</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.940" end="00:16:36.269" style="s2">that as you say have to be unbundled so</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.800" end="00:16:39.020" style="s2">just because I&#39;ve never actually uttered</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.269" end="00:16:42.060" style="s2">the word exegetical you want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.020" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">basically interpretive interpretive so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.060" end="00:16:45.930" style="s2">to do exegesis is to interpret the text</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">so I will give you an here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.930" end="00:16:51.870" style="s2">the Torah says that you should not do</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:54.140" style="s2">maloha on Shabbat on the Sabbath and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.870" end="00:16:57.329" style="s2">then it never tells you what melaka is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.140" end="00:16:58.890" style="s2">so the rabbi&#39;s had to decide what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.329" end="00:17:01.170" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to do on the Sabbath</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.890" end="00:17:02.790" style="s2">and they come up with all sorts of rules</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.170" end="00:17:07.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how they get there but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.790" end="00:17:10.290" style="s2">the point is no text is self-explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.160" end="00:17:11.459" style="s2">well so that this is one of the keys</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.290" end="00:17:14.669" style="s2">there&#39;s so many different ways to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.459" end="00:17:17.730" style="s2">from this point one of the differences</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.669" end="00:17:21.419" style="s2">that I like to point to between</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.730" end="00:17:25.319" style="s2">religions has to do with claims in</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.419" end="00:17:28.890" style="s2">another spin-off which is Islam that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.319" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">Quran is its own exegesis right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.890" end="00:17:34.620" style="s2">therefore interpretation somehow</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">pollutes the purity of the text now</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.620" end="00:17:39.300" style="s2">there are different schools within Islam</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:41.070" style="s2">or I think for schools of main schools</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.300" end="00:17:44.040" style="s2">of jurisprudence or maybe there are more</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.070" end="00:17:46.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but is that a major</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.040" end="00:17:47.920" style="s2">difference between these two traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.620" end="00:17:51.220" style="s2">I would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.920" end="00:17:53.950" style="s2">I I don&#39;t want to pronounce on Islam I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.220" end="00:17:56.710" style="s2">would say to the extent that any</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.950" end="00:17:58.930" style="s2">tradition says that a text does not have</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.710" end="00:18:01.630" style="s2">to be interpreted Judaism will take</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.930" end="00:18:04.330" style="s2">issue with that that there is no way out</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.630" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">there is no way out of interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.330" end="00:18:09.910" style="s2">any text it doesn&#39;t matter how elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:14.020" style="s2">how long and how literal and how literal</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.910" end="00:18:17.350" style="s2">no because even the most literal text I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.020" end="00:18:20.800" style="s2">mean the 10 commit there out nod murder</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.350" end="00:18:24.060" style="s2">what is murder how can you not how can</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.800" end="00:18:29.170" style="s2">you say that self-explanatory it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.060" end="00:18:32.050" style="s2">I&#39;m murderers you know right so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.170" end="00:18:33.730" style="s2">for me one of the problems that I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.050" end="00:18:36.310" style="s2">traditionally had with like the sam</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.730" end="00:18:38.620" style="s2">harris school of interpretation yes is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.310" end="00:18:41.790" style="s2">is that there is a hidden assumption</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.620" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">which is that the literal interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.790" end="00:18:48.190" style="s2">of text as if such a thing existed holds</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:51.100" style="s2">pride of place right because it is in</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.190" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">some sense the minimally distant from</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.100" end="00:18:58.570" style="s2">the text therefore one should interpret</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:19:01.620" style="s2">any organization by its texts it with</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:05.550" style="s2">the minimal distortion from</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.620" end="00:19:09.100" style="s2">interpretation whereas my belief is any</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.100" end="00:19:12.970" style="s2">u.s. plays this role with the</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.930" end="00:19:23.740" style="s2">Court and and the Oh constantly having</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.330" end="00:19:26.470" style="s2">to interpret the document I find it very</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.740" end="00:19:29.170" style="s2">strange that we would be so caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.470" end="00:19:32.680" style="s2">the text of the document given that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.170" end="00:19:36.070" style="s2">have to have ways of living with things</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.680" end="00:19:39.070" style="s2">that age well my my argument among many</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.070" end="00:19:41.470" style="s2">others with Sam was always that if</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.070" end="00:19:44.260" style="s2">you&#39;re going to judge a religion you</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.470" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">have to judge it by how it&#39;s lived not</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.260" end="00:19:51.670" style="s2">by the literal word in the text because</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:54.570" style="s2">it&#39;s what a religion produces as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.670" end="00:19:56.440" style="s2">to what it says that matters and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.570" end="00:19:58.270" style="s2">therefore if you want to have an</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.270" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">for the world based on what it produces</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.190" end="00:20:02.750" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:04.430" style="s2">if you want to have an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.750" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">whether this or that verse is</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.470" end="00:20:13.010" style="s2">least to my way of thinking against</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:16.910" style="s2">religion if you find objectionable</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.010" end="00:20:19.190" style="s2">verses I can think of a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.910" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">for example that my parents said over</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.190" end="00:20:25.130" style="s2">the years that were objectionable they</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">were wonderful parents so it depends</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.130" end="00:20:30.290" style="s2">whether it depends whether you want to</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.850" end="00:20:44.330" style="s2">best way to argue against it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.460" end="00:20:49.040" style="s2">thought I think that what I get out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.330" end="00:20:52.340" style="s2">it is that we have to look at ways of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.040" end="00:20:56.390" style="s2">limiting the damage that come from the</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.390" end="00:21:00.470" style="s2">in some sense aged out of or I would</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.470" end="00:21:05.690" style="s2">because the desire to return to</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.690" end="00:21:10.310" style="s2">the purification impulse where you say</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:17.390" style="s2">that we&#39;ve strayed yes so let us go back</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.150" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">tried to make the minimal number of</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.700" end="00:24:23.710" style="s2">question about it in my mind there was a</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.700" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">change their dress and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.350" end="00:24:46.090" style="s2">change their language and and then Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:47.500" style="s2">starts to talk about actually what Jews</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.090" end="00:24:50.530" style="s2">did throughout history he said in terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.500" end="00:24:52.210" style="s2">of names the names in the Bible like</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.530" end="00:24:53.500" style="s2">Moses and Aaron and pin class and</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.040" end="00:25:18.610" style="s2">Judaism wasn&#39;t written in Hebrew it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.020" end="00:25:23.470" style="s2">written in Aramaic because they lived in</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.610" end="00:25:26.170" style="s2">Babylonia and so yes I mean there is no</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.470" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">way to be the only way to be true to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.170" end="00:25:32.280" style="s2">sources is to change the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:35.740" style="s2">much change and that&#39;s where the real</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.280" end="00:25:39.490" style="s2">nub of modern religion comes is how much</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.740" end="00:25:42.250" style="s2">can you change and still not only</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.490" end="00:25:43.990" style="s2">continuity yes exactly and and also how</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.250" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">much can you change and still transmit</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.990" end="00:25:49.390" style="s2">it generation to generation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:52.750" style="s2">question that the modern world has</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.390" end="00:25:54.250" style="s2">created can liberal religion transmit</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.750" end="00:25:57.070" style="s2">itself and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve answered</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:25:59.800" style="s2">that question well I think I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.070" end="00:26:05.290" style="s2">disappointed in the clergy in the Rebbe</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.800" end="00:26:06.250" style="s2">evident I have a crazy theory and I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.290" end="00:26:08.800" style="s2">to know what you think of it whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.250" end="00:26:10.540" style="s2">it&#39;s so cop I like crazy things like it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.800" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">could be so commonly known you think you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.540" end="00:26:15.690" style="s2">think that&#39;s crazy everybody knows that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:19.810" style="s2">at some point I became convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.690" end="00:26:22.390" style="s2">Seinfeld the show was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.810" end="00:26:25.240" style="s2">greatest innovations in modern Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.390" end="00:26:27.880" style="s2">and my reasoning was that what it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.240" end="00:26:31.030" style="s2">actually was not Jewish humor played</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.880" end="00:26:34.630" style="s2">with ethnically ambiguous people but it</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.030" end="00:26:37.150" style="s2">was actually Talmudic humor it was legal</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.630" end="00:26:39.100" style="s2">humor and each show that you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.150" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">there&#39;s this discussion of lycra gifting</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.100" end="00:26:45.160" style="s2">is it ethical to regifter</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:46.840" style="s2">so I picked one show at random and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.160" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">said I bet I&#39;m confined whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.840" end="00:26:51.610" style="s2">topic is in the Talmud then I picked the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:56.920" style="s2">show where there&#39;s an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.610" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">double dipping a chip into some salsa</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.920" end="00:27:01.150" style="s2">because after you take a bite you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:02.820" style="s2">you&#39;ve touched it with your mouth and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.150" end="00:27:06.490" style="s2">now you&#39;re dipping it again</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.820" end="00:27:08.260" style="s2">sure enough I go to the Talmud there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.490" end="00:27:10.330" style="s2">two guys two rabbis are eating hummus</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.260" end="00:27:12.250" style="s2">one with a leaf and the other with his</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.330" end="00:27:14.680" style="s2">hands and the guy who&#39;s using the leaf</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.250" end="00:27:15.910" style="s2">as an implement says tell me rabbi when</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.680" end="00:27:18.520" style="s2">are you gonna stop feeding me your</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.910" end="00:27:22.030" style="s2">saliva you know like I think yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.520" end="00:27:23.710" style="s2">guy says oh tell me rabbi akiva or</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.030" end="00:27:27.100" style="s2">whatever his name was uh when are you</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.710" end="00:27:30.510" style="s2">gonna stop feeding me your filth with</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.100" end="00:27:36.700" style="s2">the leaf yeah and this interchange</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.510" end="00:27:40.930" style="s2">proved to me that what was really going</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.700" end="00:27:44.530" style="s2">on was we were mining the more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.930" end="00:27:48.370" style="s2">parts of Judaism and figuring out a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.530" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">of making this commercially viable to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.370" end="00:27:53.770" style="s2">get into mainstream distribution</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:58.660" style="s2">channels when the rabbi&#39;s didn&#39;t pick up</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.770" end="00:28:01.510" style="s2">on how effective this is for exploring</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.660" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">the ancient texts that nobody has time</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.510" end="00:28:06.730" style="s2">for anymore I thought it was an amazing</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:34.450" style="s2">is frowned on in culture generally</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.030" end="00:31:46.270" style="s2">never say and I think people say this</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.040" end="00:31:48.070" style="s2">but if they thought about it more</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.270" end="00:31:49.690" style="s2">carefully I think they wouldn&#39;t I would</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.070" end="00:31:52.600" style="s2">never say that Judaism has survived</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.690" end="00:31:53.860" style="s2">because of persecution because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.600" end="00:31:55.510" style="s2">forgetting all those other people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.860" end="00:31:57.250" style="s2">were persecuted and disappeared to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.510" end="00:31:58.930" style="s2">history so it&#39;s not that we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.250" end="00:32:00.220" style="s2">because we were persecuted we would be</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.220" end="00:32:06.160" style="s2">persecuted there is something about</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.610" end="00:32:08.980" style="s2">feeling the pressure of you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.160" end="00:32:11.080" style="s2">prove yourself because you are a member</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.980" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">of this or that group that does</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.080" end="00:32:15.730" style="s2">absolutely contribute to a drive to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:16.210" style="s2">excellence I think there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.730" end="00:32:18.970" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.210" end="00:32:22.570" style="s2">and and Jews don&#39;t feel that the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.970" end="00:32:24.400" style="s2">they once did but I think that it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.570" end="00:32:27.820" style="s2">of a larger complex of how much Jews</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.400" end="00:32:30.660" style="s2">feel themselves part of an identifiable</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.820" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">group that they take pride in and love</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.660" end="00:32:36.610" style="s2">so this is in Hebrew there&#39;s a concept</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:41.980" style="s2">called avati Israel which means love of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.610" end="00:32:43.960" style="s2">your people and and that generally is in</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.980" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">the world that for example my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.960" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">grows up in that&#39;s frowned upon the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:51.520" style="s2">that you should love your people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.080" style="s2">thought of as negative you should love</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.520" end="00:32:56.020" style="s2">all people and know people especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.080" end="00:32:59.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s to the detriment I think of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.020" end="00:33:01.480" style="s2">any minority keeping it I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.350" end="00:33:03.730" style="s2">get this and my sense is that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.480" end="00:33:05.590" style="s2">get this either maybe that would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.730" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">something we could explore so let me</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.590" end="00:33:09.040" style="s2">give you my version of this and later</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:13.500" style="s2">you give me give me my my grade on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.040" end="00:33:15.250" style="s2">report card if you love multiculturalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.500" end="00:33:17.590" style="s2">you have to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.250" end="00:33:20.410" style="s2">multiculturalism is built on culturalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.590" end="00:33:21.850" style="s2">yes and culturalism is built on</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.410" end="00:33:25.720" style="s2">exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.850" end="00:33:29.549" style="s2">with some amount of permeability yep</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.720" end="00:33:32.860" style="s2">so what I always hear when somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.549" end="00:33:35.740" style="s2">multiculturalism is painting with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.860" end="00:33:38.260" style="s2">of distinct pigments and what has come</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.740" end="00:33:41.049" style="s2">to be the meaning of multiculturalism is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:42.700" style="s2">let&#39;s mix all the paint together and to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.049" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">get the most beautiful rainbow paint</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.700" end="00:33:46.900" style="s2">possible and in fact it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:50.350" style="s2">anything like rainbow paint once you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.900" end="00:33:53.890" style="s2">this and then in part we are responsible</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.350" end="00:33:55.990" style="s2">for caring about our own culture so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.890" end="00:33:59.980" style="s2">there is something special to bring to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.990" end="00:34:02.980" style="s2">the potluck and what concerns me is when</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.980" end="00:34:05.169" style="s2">I see somebody who&#39;s going abroad as if</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.980" end="00:34:07.690" style="s2">let&#39;s say as an American and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.169" end="00:34:09.580" style="s2">like trying to be infinitely open to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.690" end="00:34:12.760" style="s2">everything I always think of that as</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.580" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">being very selfish which is you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.409" end="00:34:24.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s not because I&#39;m not fascinated</p>

<p begin="00:35:11.020" end="00:35:15.510" style="s2">that your culture is excellent and has</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.700" end="00:35:19.420" style="s2">things that everyone could learn from</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.510" end="00:35:22.450" style="s2">then I think first of all I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.420" end="00:35:25.210" style="s2">that&#39;s sad but also I think then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.450" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">left with this indistinguishable stew as</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.210" end="00:35:34.600" style="s2">you said that loses what is unique about</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:35.740" style="s2">all these cultures so yes I I believe</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.600" end="00:35:38.369" style="s2">however that what</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.740" end="00:35:44.290" style="s2">Ultra culturalism has also become is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.369" end="00:35:47.290" style="s2">only these cultures have the right to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.290" end="00:35:49.750" style="s2">heard and those cultures don&#39;t as much</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.290" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">because historically those cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.750" end="00:35:55.810" style="s2">been heard more than mine and so there</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:57.310" style="s2">is that also to contend with because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.810" end="00:35:59.560" style="s2">is true that some cultures have been</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.310" end="00:36:01.930" style="s2">heard far more than we are a noisy</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.560" end="00:36:04.270" style="s2">culture yes and we are a noisy cultures</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.930" end="00:36:06.369" style="s2">no questions no questions as my friend</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.270" end="00:36:14.530" style="s2">Joseph Epstein says Jews don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.369" end="00:36:18.040" style="s2">they wait yes we&#39;re very verbal as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.530" end="00:36:19.930" style="s2">culture no question about it but I but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.040" end="00:36:23.500" style="s2">also think we are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.930" end="00:36:26.380" style="s2">Constituent creators of Western</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.500" end="00:36:28.810" style="s2">civilization and we have something to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.380" end="00:36:30.790" style="s2">say well this is one of the I do feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.810" end="00:36:33.850" style="s2">that one of the ways we get into trouble</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.790" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">as a culture is that we are seen as it</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.850" end="00:36:39.010" style="s2">as an impurity and going back to this</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:40.750" style="s2">question about what some cultures do</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.010" end="00:36:43.810" style="s2">well some cultures do poorly like for</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.750" end="00:36:45.850" style="s2">example I would say the Jewish food not</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.810" end="00:36:47.740" style="s2">are not are stronger not our strongest</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.850" end="00:36:51.430" style="s2">right now it&#39;s a French right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.740" end="00:36:53.830" style="s2">true we have this tradition in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.430" end="00:36:56.020" style="s2">family where we put two drops of water</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.830" end="00:36:58.630" style="s2">into the wine into the kiddush cup of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.020" end="00:37:00.970" style="s2">wine for the Friday night Sabbath meal</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.630" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s always a question of why</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.970" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">this ritual what I always liked about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:10.330" style="s2">was we have an impulse towards purity</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:12.820" style="s2">that is must be gotten rid of in my</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.330" end="00:37:14.520" style="s2">opinion because life is impure and if</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.820" end="00:37:17.770" style="s2">you start to try to purify yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.520" end="00:37:20.530" style="s2">overly much like an OCD kind of a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.770" end="00:37:22.830" style="s2">you end up tearing at your own flesh and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.530" end="00:37:25.570" style="s2">and you and you and you do real damage</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.830" end="00:37:29.950" style="s2">learning that a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.570" end="00:37:32.380" style="s2">impurity has a strengthening effect is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.950" end="00:37:35.740" style="s2">something that that I associate with</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.380" end="00:37:40.750" style="s2">that ritual and I was curious if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.740" end="00:37:42.580" style="s2">have feelings about teachings like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.750" end="00:37:44.260" style="s2">that we that we need to export is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.580" end="00:37:47.740" style="s2">an important teaching from our tradition</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.260" end="00:37:49.700" style="s2">I think that it is I mean you can you</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.740" end="00:37:52.550" style="s2">can make biological analogies to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.700" end="00:37:53.780" style="s2">- about diversity hybrid vigor right</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.550" end="00:38:01.310" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.780" end="00:38:03.260" style="s2">I I also I understand that let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.310" end="00:38:05.870" style="s2">change the language of purity for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.260" end="00:38:08.810" style="s2">second I hope that this still captures</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.870" end="00:38:13.190" style="s2">what you mean fanaticism of all</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.810" end="00:38:15.320" style="s2">varieties carries danger I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.190" end="00:38:17.240" style="s2">say is automatically dangerous no you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.320" end="00:38:19.550" style="s2">three staying perfectly carries danger</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.240" end="00:38:21.110" style="s2">because I remember like this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.550" end="00:38:23.990" style="s2">wonderful story about Isaac Stern the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.110" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">violinist who after a concert a woman</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.990" end="00:38:26.660" style="s2">came up to him and said I would do</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">anything to play like you would and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.660" end="00:38:30.860" style="s2">said oh really would you practice 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:32.900" style="s2">years 12 hours a day to play like I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.860" end="00:38:35.000" style="s2">would because that&#39;s what I did like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.900" end="00:38:37.370" style="s2">world does depend on certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.000" end="00:38:39.470" style="s2">fanaticism people who are exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.370" end="00:38:41.480" style="s2">athletes and exceptional scholars and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.470" end="00:38:43.370" style="s2">exceptional musicians many of them have</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.480" end="00:38:47.260" style="s2">a single-minded devotion so I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.370" end="00:38:50.930" style="s2">want to say let&#39;s wipe out all extremism</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.260" end="00:38:58.550" style="s2">but culturally it&#39;s tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.930" end="00:39:02.840" style="s2">dangerous so yeah so let me ask you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.550" end="00:39:06.410" style="s2">assume that I don&#39;t have the time budget</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.840" end="00:39:09.860" style="s2">right and I don&#39;t have the belief budget</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.410" end="00:39:12.140" style="s2">needed to sustain an older version of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.860" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">culture in my tradition because one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.140" end="00:39:15.560" style="s2">the things that I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:19.640" style="s2">here is I&#39;m using religion in part to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.560" end="00:39:22.280" style="s2">stand in for the need to stand up for</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.640" end="00:39:24.380" style="s2">our traditions to maintain them yes but</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.280" end="00:39:26.180" style="s2">not to become sort of jingoistic about</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.380" end="00:39:28.190" style="s2">it so assume that I don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.180" end="00:39:32.210" style="s2">budget and I&#39;m also living in a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.190" end="00:39:34.520" style="s2">multicultural world what guidance can</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.210" end="00:39:36.920" style="s2">you give me for the maintenance of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.520" end="00:39:40.910" style="s2">complicated beautiful intricate</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.920" end="00:39:42.770" style="s2">tradition that needs has historically</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.910" end="00:39:44.080" style="s2">needed more time and belief than I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.770" end="00:39:47.450" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.080" end="00:39:49.250" style="s2">so I&#39;m what I what I want to start off</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.450" end="00:39:52.520" style="s2">with and I don&#39;t know how much time this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.250" end="00:39:54.550" style="s2">takes is that the indispensable quality</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.520" end="00:39:57.470" style="s2">to maintain any tradition is knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.550" end="00:40:00.620" style="s2">you have to know something about it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.470" end="00:40:02.870" style="s2">and honestly knowledge is more easily</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.620" end="00:40:03.910" style="s2">available now than it ever was about</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.870" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.910" end="00:40:09.670" style="s2">so I think that if you care about a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.970" style="s2">tradition at least you ought to be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.670" end="00:40:18.250" style="s2">to educate yourself to the basics of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.970" end="00:40:21.700" style="s2">and and having done that then you can I</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.250" end="00:40:24.069" style="s2">think like with everything else you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.700" end="00:40:26.819" style="s2">give it a piece of your time and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.069" end="00:40:31.690" style="s2">attention that his serious and devoted</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.819" end="00:40:34.390" style="s2">because unlike focused attention is our</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">greatest resource and if you can give</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.390" end="00:40:40.599" style="s2">the tradition a little bit of that so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:43.690" style="s2">tell people all the time you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.599" end="00:40:45.549" style="s2">say a blessing before you eat mmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.690" end="00:40:47.230" style="s2">a very powerful thing and if you make</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.549" end="00:40:50.410" style="s2">sure you always do that that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.230" end="00:40:53.170" style="s2">part of your life and part of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.410" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">ability to stop and think before you put</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.170" end="00:40:57.430" style="s2">something in your mouth about your place</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:59.470" style="s2">in the universe your gratitude that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.430" end="00:41:01.450" style="s2">there all those kinds of things so there</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.470" end="00:41:03.849" style="s2">are little things that you can do but an</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.450" end="00:41:07.750" style="s2">even more powerful version of that for</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.849" end="00:41:08.920" style="s2">me is the Chicano right do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.750" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">say a little bit about how that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.920" end="00:41:13.269" style="s2">functions in our tradition there was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:16.450" style="s2">prayer that you say when something is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.269" end="00:41:18.130" style="s2">new or unprecedented or it&#39;s a special</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.450" end="00:41:19.480" style="s2">moment or the first in your life or</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.130" end="00:41:21.099" style="s2">lease life first time in the yearly</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.480" end="00:41:23.650" style="s2">cycle that you eat a fruit or wear a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.099" end="00:41:26.289" style="s2">garment or or any of those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.650" end="00:41:29.369" style="s2">things and it&#39;s an expression of what</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.289" end="00:41:31.420" style="s2">what it&#39;s it Thanks it thanks God for</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.369" end="00:41:34.900" style="s2">sustaining you and allowing you to reach</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.420" end="00:41:36.519" style="s2">that moment and and I think expressions</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.900" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">of gratitude are something that religion</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.519" end="00:41:43.569" style="s2">does very well well the reason I pick</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:46.119" style="s2">that is that you we in our tradition set</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.569" end="00:41:48.069" style="s2">a bit in our brain that says if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.119" end="00:41:51.640" style="s2">doing something for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.069" end="00:41:54.009" style="s2">the yearly cycle make a note of it right</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.640" end="00:41:57.549" style="s2">and what I find is is that if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.009" end="00:42:00.339" style="s2">do that without thanking God at all for</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.549" end="00:42:03.549" style="s2">this that would be in a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.339" end="00:42:05.109" style="s2">service to remembering like beginners</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.549" end="00:42:06.910" style="s2">mindset where I&#39;ve made it through</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.109" end="00:42:09.369" style="s2">another cycle or how sweet is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.910" end="00:42:13.420" style="s2">pomegranate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.369" end="00:42:15.819" style="s2">can we exploit this stuff so well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.420" end="00:42:17.890" style="s2">this goes back to the very beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.819" end="00:42:22.150" style="s2">the podcast which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.890" end="00:42:26.320" style="s2">can you sustain these kinds of rituals</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.150" end="00:42:28.810" style="s2">and awarenesses without the belief on</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.320" end="00:42:31.570" style="s2">which they with which they were created</p>

<p begin="00:43:18.990" end="00:43:23.740" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything weird about</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.740" end="00:43:28.630" style="s2">true like people talk about Star Wars</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.030" end="00:43:38.920" style="s2">gave this definition but I think of some</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.450" end="00:43:41.290" style="s2">of the things in the Bible like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.920" end="00:43:42.910" style="s2">story of Adam and Eve mm-hmm I think of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.290" end="00:43:44.740" style="s2">them the way this scholar defined myth</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.910" end="00:43:48.310" style="s2">he said a myth is something that is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.740" end="00:43:50.410" style="s2">factual but is always true and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.310" end="00:43:53.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot in religion that he&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.290" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">talk about the belief part of this why</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:01.650" style="s2">does belief animate this because the</p>

<p begin="00:44:20.110" end="00:44:26.920" style="s2">the part of it that I think we we really</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.790" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">get wrong and this is a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.920" end="00:44:31.390" style="s2">that maybe I&#39;ll be scolded for we have</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.010" end="00:45:21.490" style="s2">the information my belief about religion</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.490" end="00:45:24.549" style="s2">is is that it solves a very important</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.490" end="00:45:28.660" style="s2">problem which is in biology for every</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.549" end="00:45:32.500" style="s2">other species soma and germ are tied</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.660" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">together that is if I&#39;m thirsty I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.500" end="00:45:40.180" style="s2">that I need to get water but thirst is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:41.829" style="s2">proximate the ultimate is starving</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.180" end="00:45:46.119" style="s2">saving off of dehydration</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.829" end="00:45:49.000" style="s2">yep the great danger in human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.119" end="00:45:51.940" style="s2">is that hunger and starvation or arousal</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.000" end="00:45:54.279" style="s2">and reproduction you can disconnect all</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.940" end="00:45:56.230" style="s2">of these things and then tsoumas starts</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.279" end="00:45:58.390" style="s2">to take over and it says maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.230" end="00:46:01.450" style="s2">purpose of life is to be happy and every</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.390" end="00:46:03.579" style="s2">time I hear somebody say the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.450" end="00:46:06.250" style="s2">life is to be happy something important</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.579" end="00:46:09.009" style="s2">and me struggles because I hate I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.250" end="00:46:12.849" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m dying inside I really feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.009" end="00:46:15.730" style="s2">terrible about this idea of caring about</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.849" end="00:46:17.319" style="s2">intergenerational transfer is the basis</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.730" end="00:46:20.009" style="s2">of a society there&#39;s no way one</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.319" end="00:46:22.750" style="s2">generation could build this right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.009" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">this is what religion stops us from</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.750" end="00:46:27.670" style="s2">doing it stops us from thinking that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:30.220" style="s2">purpose of life is to be happy it</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.670" end="00:46:33.039" style="s2">connects us to intergenerational purpose</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.220" end="00:46:36.339" style="s2">and so rather than just thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.039" end="00:46:38.559" style="s2">myself somatically I think about being</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.339" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">part of a lineage in a history that goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.559" end="00:46:44.589" style="s2">on after my death there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:45.130" style="s2">stops me from waking up and saying wait</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.589" end="00:46:47.890" style="s2">if the perp</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.130" end="00:46:49.779" style="s2">of life is to be happy you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.890" end="00:46:51.759" style="s2">I&#39;m jonas salk but maybe I&#39;m Jeffrey</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.779" end="00:46:54.309" style="s2">Dahmer I could be anything that make</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.759" end="00:46:56.259" style="s2">making me happy this is a way of making</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.309" end="00:46:59.500" style="s2">sure that that doesn&#39;t happen that soma</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.259" end="00:47:03.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t betray germ is that really the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.500" end="00:47:09.190" style="s2">like I think that&#39;s well I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.369" end="00:47:12.730" style="s2">the idea that that religions obligation</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.190" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">is intergenerational to past generations</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.730" end="00:47:20.039" style="s2">and future generations is true and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">powerful and the way you described it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.039" end="00:47:26.289" style="s2">beautiful the one I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:29.369" style="s2">caveat the one addition is that you also</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.289" end="00:47:32.829" style="s2">have a vertical as well as a horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.369" end="00:47:36.490" style="s2">responsibility that is to transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.829" end="00:47:38.740" style="s2">to I would say your soul beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.490" end="00:47:41.049" style="s2">cell line that part of the the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.740" end="00:47:44.890" style="s2">of life is to grow in soul that there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.049" end="00:47:47.380" style="s2">something that you as an individual you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.890" end="00:47:49.180" style="s2">have a responsibility to lead a certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.380" end="00:47:52.059" style="s2">kind of life because your life is a gift</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.180" end="00:47:53.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s a responsibility to other</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.059" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">human beings but it&#39;s also just a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.559" end="00:47:58.089" style="s2">responsibility by virtue of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:48:01.900" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been given this life to live</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.089" end="00:48:06.009" style="s2">so from whom well I would say from God I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.900" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">would say you&#39;re cheating what if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.009" end="00:48:13.450" style="s2">right am i cheating well no I just well</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:17.650" style="s2">look I I&#39;m happy to get into my own</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.450" end="00:48:20.200" style="s2">theories about God but my point is to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.650" end="00:48:22.569" style="s2">able to work with multiple assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.200" end="00:48:25.420" style="s2">so without if you bracket that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.569" end="00:48:27.160" style="s2">assumption then yes I would say what</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.420" end="00:48:28.869" style="s2">religion does I had talked also about</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.160" end="00:48:30.339" style="s2">creating community right that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.869" end="00:48:33.009" style="s2">creating community with but it also</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.339" end="00:48:35.589" style="s2">creates community with the past and with</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.009" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">the future you know look this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.589" end="00:48:39.779" style="s2">wonderful line of Chesterton&#39;s he said</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:42.099" style="s2">tradition is the democracy of the dead</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.779" end="00:48:45.210" style="s2">that if everybody who ever lived got a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.099" end="00:48:47.769" style="s2">vote they would vote for tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.210" end="00:48:50.740" style="s2">you&#39;re expressing that in a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.769" end="00:48:52.980" style="s2">way that is that we owe a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.740" end="00:48:55.569" style="s2">to all the generations preceding us and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.980" end="00:48:58.119" style="s2">also to transmit to the generations</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.569" end="00:48:59.020" style="s2">following us as if we&#39;re taking and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.119" end="00:49:01.540" style="s2">handing the baton</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.020" end="00:49:05.470" style="s2">because we don&#39;t see ourselves as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.540" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">isolated creation instead as you said</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.470" end="00:49:11.230" style="s2">we&#39;re part of a chain well so let me go</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:15.130" style="s2">a little bit further with this my claim</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.230" end="00:49:19.450" style="s2">is that just as Chomsky has said that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.130" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">may have a pre-existing sort of capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.450" end="00:49:25.630" style="s2">for grammar that allows language this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:29.350" style="s2">a facility that we are given with birth</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.630" end="00:49:30.430" style="s2">as vert virtue of being human I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.350" end="00:49:32.950" style="s2">claim that there&#39;s something like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.430" end="00:49:37.830" style="s2">Chomsky and pre grammar of religious</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.950" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">belief and that no matter how atheistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.830" end="00:49:43.660" style="s2">we may claim to be I mean there was one</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.510" end="00:50:02.380" style="s2">think I would be able to relate to my</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.030" end="00:50:03.880" style="s2">own child and because I actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.380" end="00:50:07.420" style="s2">believed that all of those disabilities</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.880" end="00:50:09.310" style="s2">are the most profound genetic gift that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.420" end="00:50:13.630" style="s2">I was given but it was a gift in</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.310" end="00:50:15.630" style="s2">disguise right and I said why am i</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.630" end="00:50:18.370" style="s2">praying to something I don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.630" end="00:50:22.600" style="s2">you know and this is another version of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.370" end="00:50:25.900" style="s2">there are no atheists in the foxholes do</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.600" end="00:50:28.350" style="s2">I carry in your opinion a biological</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:33.940" style="s2">predisposition towards religious thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.350" end="00:50:36.940" style="s2">so I think that that is very likely I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.940" end="00:50:42.130" style="s2">think that&#39;s what and and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.940" end="00:50:45.270" style="s2">people have different gifts in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.130" end="00:50:47.770" style="s2">that there are Mozart&#39;s of religious</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.270" end="00:50:50.560" style="s2">predisposition they have never doubted</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.770" end="00:50:53.500" style="s2">God they feel God constantly fully and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.560" end="00:50:57.550" style="s2">then there are others who have less of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.500" end="00:51:00.010" style="s2">predisposition so I would say yes I also</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.550" end="00:51:02.110" style="s2">think by the way that your idea that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.010" end="00:51:05.770" style="s2">your disability is your gift it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.110" end="00:51:11.800" style="s2">profoundly religious idea there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.770" end="00:51:12.760" style="s2">beautiful poem from I think it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.800" end="00:51:14.890" style="s2">talks about</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.760" end="00:51:16.900" style="s2">got into sharp and sudden on some</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.890" end="00:51:20.020" style="s2">prayers it&#39;s a gauntlet with a gift in</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.900" end="00:51:21.360" style="s2">it and I would wanted to say Elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.020" end="00:51:23.580" style="s2">Barrett Browning but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.360" end="00:51:27.960" style="s2">Barrett Browning somebody in your</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.580" end="00:51:31.570" style="s2">audience will google it and no and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.960" end="00:51:33.310" style="s2">that that notion that the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.570" end="00:51:37.780" style="s2">that you have are things that are given</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.310" end="00:51:40.870" style="s2">to you in order to climb higher I I</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.780" end="00:51:42.820" style="s2">think that that also is a I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.870" end="00:51:44.410" style="s2">if it&#39;s an inbuilt religious notion but</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.820" end="00:51:46.300" style="s2">I think in some ways it probably is</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.410" end="00:51:48.340" style="s2">because people often recur to that when</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.300" end="00:51:50.980" style="s2">something bad happens that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.340" end="00:51:52.930" style="s2">find a way you know I one of my books</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.980" end="00:51:55.690" style="s2">was called making lost matter the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.930" end="00:51:57.250" style="s2">thing so now I wouldn&#39;t choose this but</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.690" end="00:52:00.580" style="s2">having been given this now I have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.250" end="00:52:02.770" style="s2">figure out how to use it to climb higher</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.580" end="00:52:07.960" style="s2">than I would have had I not been given</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.770" end="00:52:10.840" style="s2">this disability so yes I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.960" end="00:52:14.590" style="s2">I I think that it is let me put it this</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.840" end="00:52:15.880" style="s2">way I think that your theory has a</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.590" end="00:52:18.430" style="s2">better chance of being right than</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.880" end="00:52:20.170" style="s2">Chomsky&#39;s that is it&#39;s more likely that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.430" end="00:52:21.730" style="s2">we have a religious and natural</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.170" end="00:52:23.820" style="s2">religious inclination then that we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.730" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">a natural grammatical inclination yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.820" end="00:52:34.300" style="s2">is that my belief is that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">irrational for me to deny the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.300" end="00:52:40.510" style="s2">my brain is that constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:44.380" style="s2">tell magical supernatural non</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.510" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">materialistic stories of us we do well</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.380" end="00:52:50.110" style="s2">but I&#39;m more disturbed by this than you</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">probably well I I can look I mean I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.110" end="00:52:54.190" style="s2">internal count well the ink the English</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.990" style="s2">essayist Thomas De Quincey said not to</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.190" end="00:52:58.570" style="s2">be a little superstitious as to lack</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.990" end="00:52:59.500" style="s2">generosity of mind so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.570" end="00:53:04.350" style="s2">you&#39;re just showing that you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.500" end="00:53:08.950" style="s2">generosity of mine but you have also you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.350" end="00:53:11.250" style="s2">you have a supervening ability to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.950" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">recognize when your stories are not</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.250" end="00:53:19.270" style="s2">rational stories it&#39;s unclear you know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:22.180" style="s2">look at well alright let&#39;s get in let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.270" end="00:53:24.670" style="s2">get into more weird stuff you and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.180" end="00:53:26.460" style="s2">belong to a tradition with I think one</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.670" end="00:53:29.400" style="s2">quarter one percent of the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.460" end="00:53:31.880" style="s2">population right about 25% of the Nobel</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.880" end="00:53:37.560" style="s2">in general actually all right all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.890" end="00:53:39.450" style="s2">them now assuming that it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.560" end="00:53:41.369" style="s2">and as I said on the Joe Rogan program</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.450" end="00:53:44.730" style="s2">that Jews cheated physics we can ask me</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.369" end="00:53:45.480" style="s2">why this was maybe there&#39;s a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.730" end="00:53:47.790" style="s2">component</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.480" end="00:53:49.320" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a cultural component maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.790" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">the fact that we are willing to take our</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.320" end="00:53:54.119" style="s2">some of our best people and not put them</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:56.849" style="s2">in finance put them in dead-end</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.119" end="00:53:59.430" style="s2">financial jobs in in physics and in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.849" end="00:54:03.270" style="s2">Physiology and medicine whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.430" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">crazy to me to abandon a completely is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.270" end="00:54:06.630" style="s2">assume that we&#39;re totally about</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:07.730" style="s2">superstition magical thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.630" end="00:54:10.530" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.730" end="00:54:14.250" style="s2">somehow that superstitious magical</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.530" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">thinking tradition produced a complete</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.250" end="00:54:18.930" style="s2">surplus of reason creative ability to</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.369" end="00:54:24.030" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be insane to walk away from</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.770" end="00:54:27.000" style="s2">that saying it&#39;s a bunch of mumbo-jumbo</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.030" end="00:54:33.960" style="s2">about God that&#39;s why I said when I</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.000" end="00:54:36.390" style="s2">debated and say well that stupid there</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.960" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">and dismiss the religion that you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.390" end="00:54:40.859" style="s2">to look at the product of what a</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">religion gives you in the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.859" end="00:54:50.089" style="s2">think that Judaism has a lot you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:52.470" style="s2">has a pretty strong black ledger balance</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.089" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve given the world an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.470" end="00:54:58.950" style="s2">enormous amount and continue to and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:01.290" style="s2">I&#39;m always astonished even though I know</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.950" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s true when I turn to the obituary in</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.290" end="00:55:04.619" style="s2">the paper and I read about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:06.780" style="s2">remarkable life in this creative life</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.619" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">and sure enough his parents were Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.780" end="00:55:11.880" style="s2">and they came from you know some small</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:15.000" style="s2">town in Poland and I just think how does</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.880" end="00:55:18.920" style="s2">this happen and it&#39;s at least as</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.000" end="00:55:21.330" style="s2">rational to say there is some special</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.920" end="00:55:24.420" style="s2">mission that the Jews have in this world</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.330" end="00:55:26.700" style="s2">as it is to say oh it&#39;s because of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.420" end="00:55:29.310" style="s2">medieval training that they got you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.700" end="00:55:31.410" style="s2">where where some of the some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.310" end="00:55:33.630" style="s2">literate priests became celibate but all</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.410" end="00:55:35.730" style="s2">the most capable rabbis had many</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.630" end="00:55:38.550" style="s2">children or I had this by the way I had</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.730" end="00:55:40.140" style="s2">this conversation I I warn you here</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.550" end="00:55:41.820" style="s2">comes a major name drop but</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.140" end="00:55:44.460" style="s2">literally had this conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.820" end="00:55:46.350" style="s2">Dalai Lama because when we went to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.460" end="00:55:47.880" style="s2">him in Dharamsala in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.350" end="00:55:49.110" style="s2">conversation he turns to me and points</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.880" end="00:55:52.920" style="s2">at me and says what&#39;s this about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.110" end="00:55:54.750" style="s2">chosen people anyway so apropos of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.920" end="00:55:56.610" style="s2">nothing we were talking about so he says</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.750" end="00:55:59.070" style="s2">he&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.610" end="00:56:00.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t know so I said to him well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.070" end="00:56:01.890" style="s2">true that you think they&#39;re chosen I</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.390" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">said but that doesn&#39;t mean that other</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.890" end="00:56:08.100" style="s2">people aren&#39;t chosen for other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:09.930" style="s2">missions and things in the world and he</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.100" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">laughed and he said yes the Tibetans</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.930" end="00:56:13.470" style="s2">think were chosen too</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:15.960" style="s2">and so the other part of this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.470" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">every people has this sense that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.960" end="00:56:20.490" style="s2">special but that&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:23.000" style="s2">not a bad thing I was as I was uh just</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.490" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">talking with a black acquaintance</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.000" end="00:56:30.600" style="s2">comedian over at the Comedy Store who</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:32.460" style="s2">said hi to me in a bar in the bar and he</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.600" end="00:56:35.010" style="s2">was talking about struggling with being</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.460" end="00:56:37.740" style="s2">black and the crime and the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.010" end="00:56:39.660" style="s2">negative parts of the tradition and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.740" end="00:56:41.790" style="s2">was able to say do you realize that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.660" end="00:56:44.160" style="s2">always been in awe of your community and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.790" end="00:56:45.660" style="s2">then I went through with with some</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.160" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">detail because I&#39;ve actually been</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.660" end="00:56:50.970" style="s2">fascinated by the idea you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:53.070" style="s2">partially because of our own tradition</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.970" end="00:56:55.860" style="s2">focuses so much on slavery than blacks</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.070" end="00:56:58.860" style="s2">embraced the Jewish idea of Moses and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.860" end="00:57:01.140" style="s2">the whole Exodus and so I started going</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.860" end="00:57:05.120" style="s2">into black intellectual achievement and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.140" end="00:57:08.850" style="s2">I think there&#39;s something about being</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.120" end="00:57:12.050" style="s2">curated by somebody outside of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.850" end="00:57:15.270" style="s2">it&#39;s why we value de Tocqueville as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.050" end="00:57:18.330" style="s2">commentator on the American scene we</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.270" end="00:57:21.300" style="s2">need to be seen by others and not just</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.330" end="00:57:24.300" style="s2">promoting ourselves right I think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.300" end="00:57:25.470" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.300" end="00:57:28.080" style="s2">things I wanted to talk about is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.470" end="00:57:32.460" style="s2">loss of insularity and one of my most</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.080" end="00:57:35.970" style="s2">dangerous theories which is the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.460" end="00:57:39.420" style="s2">first shiksa effect okay yeah so I want</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.970" end="00:57:41.250" style="s2">to tell two jokes okay one the Jews so</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.420" end="00:57:42.600" style="s2">these are internal Jewish jokes one is</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.250" end="00:57:45.900" style="s2">negative against the Jews and one is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.600" end="00:57:49.020" style="s2">positive for the Jews okay okay so one</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.900" end="00:57:53.070" style="s2">joke is why did God create the goyim</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.020" end="00:57:56.100" style="s2">that is the non-jews because</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.070" end="00:57:57.390" style="s2">somebody had to pay retail Oh oh come on</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.100" end="00:57:58.200" style="s2">you know that you&#39;re pretending that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.390" end="00:57:59.820" style="s2">don&#39;t all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.200" end="00:58:03.060" style="s2">the other joke is what&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.820" end="00:58:05.400" style="s2">problem with Jewish cooking seventy-two</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.060" end="00:58:07.350" style="s2">hours later you&#39;re hungry again right so</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.400" end="00:58:08.610" style="s2">in the first case the idea is where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.350" end="00:58:10.260" style="s2">smart guys who always pay wholesale</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.610" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">right as we know somebody may not need</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.260" end="00:58:13.260" style="s2">to get others also there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.640" end="00:58:16.590" style="s2">anti-semitic trope about Jews and money</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.260" end="00:58:18.780" style="s2">buried in that joke yep yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.590" end="00:58:20.310" style="s2">then the other the other one you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.780" end="00:58:22.170" style="s2">points out that our food is too heavy</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.310" end="00:58:24.420" style="s2">because we always were worried that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.170" end="00:58:26.700" style="s2">had nutritional issues and you might as</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.420" end="00:58:27.690" style="s2">well get as much fat in people because</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.700" end="00:58:28.830" style="s2">you never know what your next meal is</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.690" end="00:58:34.200" style="s2">going to be interrupted</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.830" end="00:58:39.150" style="s2">now the first shiksa effect has to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.200" end="00:58:43.020" style="s2">with the first time an insular group is</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.150" end="00:58:45.560" style="s2">visited by somebody bringing in somebody</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.020" end="00:58:48.360" style="s2">from outside mm-hmm and so all of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.560" end="00:58:51.210" style="s2">very potent knowledge and this could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.360" end="00:58:54.690" style="s2">the Parsees in India it could be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.210" end="00:58:58.440" style="s2">Mafia it could be the the mate the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.690" end="00:59:01.890" style="s2">Freemasons that the danger of internally</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.440" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">held knowledge suddenly having some sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.890" end="00:59:08.910" style="s2">of a periscope in starts to attenuate</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:12.180" style="s2">and so for example my my wife&#39;s family</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.910" end="00:59:15.510" style="s2">were Jews of Calcutta I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.180" end="00:59:17.340" style="s2">time there was an inner marriage the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.510" end="00:59:19.220" style="s2">parent says oh I&#39;m gonna sit Shiva that</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.340" end="00:59:23.820" style="s2">is I&#39;m going to treat this child as if</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.220" end="00:59:28.260" style="s2">she&#39;s dead to me but very quickly that</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.820" end="00:59:30.180" style="s2">erodes because it it&#39;s the second person</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.260" end="00:59:33.570" style="s2">to come into a family or the third</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.180" end="00:59:37.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the same effect because all</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.570" end="00:59:39.120" style="s2">of that hyper insular stuff gets lost</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.020" end="00:59:40.620" style="s2">almost instantly and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.120" end="00:59:43.020" style="s2">there&#39;s both something super positive</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.620" end="00:59:46.500" style="s2">about that because the insularity causes</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.020" end="00:59:48.000" style="s2">a kind of danger towards jingoism right</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.500" end="00:59:49.530" style="s2">but there&#39;s also something sad about</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.000" end="00:59:51.030" style="s2">that which is that some of that was the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.530" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">most powerful knowledge that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.030" end="00:59:56.820" style="s2">community possessed any thoughts I this</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:59.490" style="s2">is an eternal struggle and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.820" end="01:00:06.360" style="s2">that there it is a reconcilable struggle</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.490" end="01:00:10.740" style="s2">between the the integrity</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.360" end="01:00:13.050" style="s2">and depth of a community that knows each</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.740" end="01:00:15.800" style="s2">other relies on each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.050" end="01:00:19.530" style="s2">cares about each other and can transmit</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.800" end="01:00:23.850" style="s2">for generations and generations and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.530" end="01:00:27.740" style="s2">community that at the same time some</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.850" end="01:00:31.260" style="s2">carries that virus of insularity of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.740" end="01:00:33.570" style="s2">superiority of you know all that stuff I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.260" end="01:00:36.110" style="s2">mean I think sometimes when I talked to</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.570" end="01:00:39.450" style="s2">students about this exact thing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.110" end="01:00:42.690" style="s2">use the first shiksa as an example but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.450" end="01:00:44.970" style="s2">talk about when I tell them that it has</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.690" end="01:00:47.880" style="s2">to do all with Crest toothpaste when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.970" end="01:00:50.850" style="s2">was a kid what my - I&#39;ll tell you okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.880" end="01:00:54.150" style="s2">my mother told us the crest was the best</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.850" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">best toothpaste and and when I used to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.150" end="01:00:58.560" style="s2">go to other kids houses and they would</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:00.450" style="s2">use like Colgate or one of the really</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.560" end="01:01:02.250" style="s2">unserious toothpaste so I had the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.450" end="01:01:03.450" style="s2">like Pepsi - yeah yeah I would think</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.250" end="01:01:06.300" style="s2">what&#39;s the matter with these people</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.450" end="01:01:07.770" style="s2">don&#39;t they know Aquifer still good fresh</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.300" end="01:01:11.160" style="s2">oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.770" end="01:01:13.290" style="s2">but with a little green strip but the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.160" end="01:01:16.550" style="s2">day that I realized there goes my</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.290" end="01:01:20.910" style="s2">endorsement remember that you could use</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.550" end="01:01:23.070" style="s2">tom&#39;s toothpaste or whatever and and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.910" end="01:01:25.560" style="s2">could be as smart and as caring and as</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.070" end="01:01:27.570" style="s2">intelligent and has learned it as my</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.560" end="01:01:30.180" style="s2">parents something changed about my world</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.570" end="01:01:32.430" style="s2">forever with Crest toothpaste with Crest</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.180" end="01:01:34.350" style="s2">toothpaste because as soon as you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.430" end="01:01:36.420" style="s2">that actually everything I do is not the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.350" end="01:01:38.610" style="s2">only way to do it or the only right way</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.420" end="01:01:40.700" style="s2">to do it it opens up the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.610" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">that everything you know is wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.700" end="01:01:46.230" style="s2">all of modern culture is this balance</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:48.270" style="s2">between what do I know that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.230" end="01:01:49.950" style="s2">right and worth preserving and what have</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.270" end="01:01:52.200" style="s2">I learned from all these other wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.950" end="01:01:56.130" style="s2">people and cultures and exposure and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.200" end="01:01:57.900" style="s2">on that should change and and it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.130" end="01:02:00.570" style="s2">anybody who cares about tradition it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.900" end="01:02:02.930" style="s2">a constant daily dilemma</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.570" end="01:02:06.260" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have any clear resolution I</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.930" end="01:02:10.110" style="s2">felt this way with them</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.260" end="01:02:11.550" style="s2">who was the Alan Schurman and Tom Lehrer</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.110" end="01:02:15.120" style="s2">right Alan Schurman</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.550" end="01:02:16.590" style="s2">yeah Tom Lehrer was really important to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.120" end="01:02:18.630" style="s2">me I mean that those songs and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.590" end="01:02:20.130" style="s2">lyrics and the cleverness culture I</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.630" end="01:02:22.620" style="s2">loved Alan Schurman too but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.130" end="01:02:25.770" style="s2">oh really yeah you&#39;re I was at the UNCHR</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.620" end="01:02:31.470" style="s2">s10 yeah well when I first went to India</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.770" end="01:02:34.200" style="s2">I think I was 19 or 20 and it was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.470" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">profound experience and my first</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.200" end="01:02:38.490" style="s2">introduction actually was going through</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:41.190" style="s2">karachi and i asked i had to use the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.490" end="01:02:43.980" style="s2">restroom and i got shown to a room that</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.190" end="01:02:45.690" style="s2">had no resemblance to a restroom that i</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.980" end="01:02:50.850" style="s2">understood there was no toilet there was</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.690" end="01:02:52.680" style="s2">no paper and i progressively and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.850" end="01:02:54.690" style="s2">went to Bombay I realized I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.680" end="01:02:58.200" style="s2">how to eat with my fingers properly I</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.690" end="01:03:01.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t know any of the customs I I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.200" end="01:03:04.260" style="s2">being sent back to infant hood right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.160" end="01:03:08.490" style="s2">that the experience that you could do</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.260" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">everything differently was a shock yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.490" end="01:03:16.590" style="s2">it is a shock and that people are as</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:19.140" style="s2">happy as you know kind as everything</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.590" end="01:03:23.430" style="s2">that this I mean that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.140" end="01:03:26.010" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the one of the advantages</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.430" end="01:03:29.570" style="s2">of the modern world the post imperialist</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.010" end="01:03:32.250" style="s2">world that is really important is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.570" end="01:03:34.260" style="s2">the automatic assumption of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.250" end="01:03:36.720" style="s2">superiority of a culture can no longer</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.260" end="01:03:40.110" style="s2">be maintained the way that it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.720" end="01:03:42.030" style="s2">unthinkingly even 50 years ago you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.110" end="01:03:43.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s a good thing well it is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.030" end="01:03:45.540" style="s2">good thing but it&#39;s also not a good but</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.560" end="01:03:47.340" style="s2">it&#39;s also a problematic so can we talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.540" end="01:03:48.900" style="s2">about this from our perspective because</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.340" end="01:03:52.700" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s driving me</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.900" end="01:03:56.220" style="s2">crazy yeah at the moment 2019 is</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.700" end="01:04:00.150" style="s2">self-hating Jews have been a thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.220" end="01:04:01.850" style="s2">a very tough road to hoe if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.150" end="01:04:07.020" style="s2">Jewish and there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.850" end="01:04:09.510" style="s2">temptation to turn on the group yes I am</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.020" end="01:04:11.670" style="s2">seeing that same thing become</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.510" end="01:04:14.190" style="s2">self-hating Christians self-hating</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.670" end="01:04:17.730" style="s2">American self-hating Europe no question</p>

<p begin="01:04:46.250" end="01:04:51.890" style="s2">has done but Europe America so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.859" end="01:04:55.630" style="s2">terrible things cruel things unspeakable</p>

<p begin="01:05:09.410" end="01:05:15.470" style="s2">problem is that everybody seems to align</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.880" end="01:05:17.809" style="s2">on one side of the butter on the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.470" end="01:05:19.430" style="s2">that is there I are entirely devoted to</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.430" end="01:05:24.410" style="s2">to the boosterism and and you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:26.089" style="s2">able to hold both ends of the pole you</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.410" end="01:05:28.790" style="s2">have to be able to say look America does</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.089" end="01:05:31.490" style="s2">notable things sometimes and that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.790" end="01:05:32.900" style="s2">but on the other hand look at what</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.490" end="01:05:33.829" style="s2">America brings to the world and has</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.900" end="01:05:37.099" style="s2">brought up a but where did this</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.829" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">polarization come from I mean like all</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.099" end="01:05:42.890" style="s2">we do is we struggle and we weigh things</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:45.460" style="s2">and then it&#39;s so it&#39;s so I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.890" end="01:05:48.619" style="s2">swear I&#39;m gonna stop myself it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.460" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">simplistic yes we do not live in the age</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.619" end="01:05:56.630" style="s2">of nuance</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:58.250" style="s2">you know we live in the age of of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.630" end="01:06:01.059" style="s2">gonna disagree with this okay I think we</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.250" end="01:06:05.000" style="s2">do live in the age of nuance it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.059" end="01:06:08.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s that the structures</p>

<p begin="01:06:08.030" end="01:06:13.609" style="s2">could trust that that structure could</p>

<p begin="01:06:13.609" end="01:06:20.540" style="s2">example I used to read The Economist for</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.299" end="01:06:23.450" style="s2">nuance right institutionally it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.540" end="01:06:25.790" style="s2">be under fire now humans that used to</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.450" end="01:06:28.849" style="s2">work for the Economist are you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.790" end="01:06:30.770" style="s2">sipping their cognac saying wow this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.849" end="01:06:33.349" style="s2">really gone to hell in a handbasket</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.770" end="01:06:35.450" style="s2">but it&#39;s the institutional prep the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.349" end="01:06:37.640" style="s2">pressures on institutions are different</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.450" end="01:06:40.130" style="s2">from the pressures on the autonomous</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.200" end="01:06:57.000" style="s2">have nuance it&#39;s now the sense making</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:06:59.730" style="s2">channels and I&#39;m gonna specifically</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.000" end="01:07:03.330" style="s2">single out like the news organs the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.730" end="01:07:06.360" style="s2">political parties the universities that</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.330" end="01:07:06.870" style="s2">have seen this unbelievable crashing and</p>

<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:23.160" style="s2">embarrassingly law structures that can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:07:53.640" end="01:07:57.840" style="s2">thing if you&#39;re gonna get slammed on</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.310" end="01:07:59.760" style="s2">Twitter and in social media and people</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.840" end="01:08:03.330" style="s2">are gonna write Facebook posts about you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.760" end="01:08:05.040" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re you get scared okay but</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.330" end="01:08:07.050" style="s2">let&#39;s say they&#39;re for and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.040" end="01:08:09.330" style="s2">people don&#39;t venture out of their circle</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.050" end="01:08:10.590" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re on one side of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.330" end="01:08:11.880" style="s2">divide you don&#39;t see anything nice about</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.590" end="01:08:14.550" style="s2">the people on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.880" end="01:08:17.310" style="s2">divide yeah but let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.550" end="01:08:19.950" style="s2">really one of our best features as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.310" end="01:08:23.130" style="s2">culture which is the courage to stand</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.950" end="01:08:25.859" style="s2">alone yeah now one of the weird things</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.130" end="01:08:28.440" style="s2">in it so I was just came from San</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.859" end="01:08:31.170" style="s2">Francisco where I was at the kitchen</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.440" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">which is a cupola congregation of kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.170" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">of experimental Judaism and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:40.380" style="s2">things that I love in Judaism is when</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:42.450" style="s2">you&#39;re in the standing prayer you take</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.380" end="01:08:44.549" style="s2">your time to say you&#39;re standing prayer</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.450" end="01:08:46.529" style="s2">and you don&#39;t necessarily sit down all</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.549" end="01:08:48.569" style="s2">at once yeah so you&#39;ve always got some</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.529" end="01:08:50.250" style="s2">people who take longer than everybody</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.569" end="01:08:52.560" style="s2">else who are just stand literally</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.250" end="01:08:55.620" style="s2">standing alone yeah and I always thought</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.560" end="01:08:58.500" style="s2">what a great aspect to have this be</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.620" end="01:09:00.440" style="s2">normal to stand alone now I bring that</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.500" end="01:09:05.869" style="s2">up because I was thinking recent</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.440" end="01:09:07.940" style="s2">about the weird fact that I know all of</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.869" end="01:09:11.949" style="s2">the names of the Senators who opposed</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.940" end="01:09:14.690" style="s2">the Patriot Act in the wake of 9/11</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.949" end="01:09:18.079" style="s2">mm-hmm right because they&#39;re all named</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.690" end="01:09:20.839" style="s2">Feingold yeah Russ Feingold was the only</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.079" end="01:09:22.909" style="s2">guy to vote against the Patriot Act when</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.839" end="01:09:25.819" style="s2">it was passed because the country was in</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.909" end="01:09:28.690" style="s2">a fever to do something to take away</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.819" end="01:09:29.959" style="s2">people&#39;s rights and one guy said no</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.690" end="01:09:31.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.959" end="01:09:34.639" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember anybody&#39;s name on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.880" end="01:09:36.859" style="s2">other side of that vote right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.639" end="01:09:40.909" style="s2">something about standing alone which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.859" end="01:09:43.789" style="s2">I think speaks to our best impulses yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.909" end="01:09:46.429" style="s2">I mean I I certainly understand that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.789" end="01:09:49.719" style="s2">indispensable quality to lead a good</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.429" end="01:09:56.090" style="s2">life is courage and that courage is hard</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.719" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">and you&#39;d see it on display every single</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.090" end="01:10:05.780" style="s2">day when in Twitter which is a universe</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:09.739" style="s2">that you and I both inhabit and Facebook</p>

<p begin="01:10:11.570" end="01:10:18.679" style="s2">totally don&#39;t get it exactly there there</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.909" end="01:10:20.209" style="s2">you go to say something that is against</p>

<p begin="01:12:15.229" end="01:12:18.889" style="s2">world and the other odd part about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.179" end="01:12:20.989" style="s2">the other one that went that fast was</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.200" end="01:15:52.360" style="s2">homology between Jews and Muslims and in</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.150" end="01:15:55.170" style="s2">fact I think they opened up a kosher</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.360" end="01:15:57.550" style="s2">deli in Harvard Square and all of my</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.170" end="01:15:59.650" style="s2">Muslim friends were eating at the kosher</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.550" end="01:16:02.950" style="s2">because halal was close enough to cut</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.650" end="01:16:06.220" style="s2">Schrute exactly what do we do with this</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.950" end="01:16:09.220" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s really such a weird place it</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.220" end="01:16:12.160" style="s2">is agonizing it&#39;s agonizing because</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.220" end="01:16:14.230" style="s2">first of all the Jews and Christians</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.160" end="01:16:15.820" style="s2">have reached a rapprochement that would</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.230" end="01:16:19.420" style="s2">have been unimaginable though the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.820" end="01:16:21.670" style="s2">maevius generations and so one can hope</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.420" end="01:16:29.020" style="s2">that the same thing would happen with</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.670" end="01:16:33.250" style="s2">Islam and Judaism right now so much of</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.020" end="01:16:37.000" style="s2">the the focus is political which is also</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.250" end="01:16:38.860" style="s2">a problem in general you know when</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.000" end="01:16:41.980" style="s2">people have nothing no cultures in</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.860" end="01:16:43.660" style="s2">common all the talk turns to politics</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.980" end="01:16:45.970" style="s2">and politics swallows everything and</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.660" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">because America doesn&#39;t have a common</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.970" end="01:16:50.230" style="s2">culture anymore nobody watches the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:52.720" style="s2">shows or reads the same books or listens</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.230" end="01:16:54.340" style="s2">to the same music yes sort of that Game</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.720" end="01:16:56.140" style="s2">of Thrones thing was pretty big it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.340" end="01:16:59.920" style="s2">pretty big but my guess it was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.140" end="01:17:02.200" style="s2">big in it even there yeah yeah it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.920" end="01:17:04.810" style="s2">big like you know like Walter Cronkite</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.200" end="01:17:06.550" style="s2">exactly so everything becomes politics</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.810" end="01:17:08.380" style="s2">and when politics starts to swallow</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.550" end="01:17:11.560" style="s2">everything including relations between</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.380" end="01:17:14.980" style="s2">religions it it I don&#39;t want to say it</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.560" end="01:17:17.770" style="s2">poisons it but it poisons it well I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:18:28.690" end="01:18:33.610" style="s2">all of these people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.340" end="01:18:35.650" style="s2">struggle in public yes because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.610" end="01:18:37.329" style="s2">what that is what you need and you as</p>

<p begin="01:18:37.329" end="01:18:44.289" style="s2">still have in my head about ten years</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.079" end="01:18:46.090" style="s2">ago we had a bunch of scholars from</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.289" end="01:18:47.800" style="s2">around the world religion scholars they</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.090" end="01:18:50.110" style="s2">were graduate students and some</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.800" end="01:18:52.480" style="s2">professors who came to a service at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.110" end="01:18:56.050" style="s2">synagogue and afterwards a guy from</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.480" end="01:18:57.550" style="s2">Pakistan said to me you know I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.050" end="01:18:58.869" style="s2">been in a synagogue I had no idea what</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.550" end="01:19:00.190" style="s2">Jews were like you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.869" end="01:19:02.949" style="s2">different from everything I learned</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.190" end="01:19:04.210" style="s2">growing up and the the service is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.949" end="01:19:06.699" style="s2">different and everything is different</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.210" end="01:19:09.789" style="s2">and I said just do me one favor when you</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.699" end="01:19:12.760" style="s2">go home tell people and he said no one</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.789" end="01:19:14.230" style="s2">will believe me no no and I thought no</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.760" end="01:19:15.519" style="s2">one will believe you and I mean what do</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.230" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">you do with that we got it we got to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.519" end="01:19:20.170" style="s2">something better with this I used to</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:22.869" style="s2">travel in the Islamic world openly as a</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.170" end="01:19:27.159" style="s2">Jew mm-hmm and I can tell you I was</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.869" end="01:19:29.050" style="s2">treated so incredibly well I always was</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.159" end="01:19:30.880" style="s2">concerned that this was a stupid way of</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.050" end="01:19:32.949" style="s2">making a statement and I would not do</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.880" end="01:19:35.769" style="s2">this now I don&#39;t think I would do it</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.949" end="01:19:40.119" style="s2">today only one place I ever encountered</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.769" end="01:19:41.920" style="s2">open anti-semitism was in Cargill on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.119" end="01:19:43.389" style="s2">border between India and Pakistan where</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.920" end="01:19:45.820" style="s2">it said if every Muslim would simply</p>

<p begin="01:19:51.400" end="01:19:55.210" style="s2">very often have the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.260" end="01:19:57.489" style="s2">somebody saying I&#39;d never met a Jew</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.210" end="01:20:00.909" style="s2">before and I had a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.489" end="01:20:03.880" style="s2">idea of who you would be there is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.909" end="01:20:05.330" style="s2">aspect in return which is I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.880" end="01:20:10.580" style="s2">what we do</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.330" end="01:20:14.330" style="s2">about the problem with some portion of</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.580" end="01:20:18.250" style="s2">Islam having become cancerous and being</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.330" end="01:20:20.110" style="s2">spread through this internal network and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.250" end="01:20:24.760" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.110" end="01:20:27.290" style="s2">that is wonderful wholesome and decent</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.760" end="01:20:30.590" style="s2">code traveling with this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.290" end="01:20:33.110" style="s2">jihadist impulse you know look we have</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.590" end="01:20:36.110" style="s2">our own crazies true but it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.110" end="01:20:39.650" style="s2">in terms of a threat to the world this</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.110" end="01:20:41.540" style="s2">is right now the preeminent what we got</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.650" end="01:20:43.730" style="s2">to be able to talk we look we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.540" end="01:20:47.710" style="s2">able to discuss this and the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.730" end="01:20:51.020" style="s2">I found I would say my friend group has</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.710" end="01:20:53.180" style="s2">probably at its maximum was about thirty</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.020" end="01:20:55.340" style="s2">percent Muslim hmm and the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.180" end="01:21:01.250" style="s2">changed my thinking about Islam and</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.340" end="01:21:03.140" style="s2">Judaism it began with a lunch and there</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.250" end="01:21:05.870" style="s2">were three couples one Jewish which I</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.140" end="01:21:08.540" style="s2">was part of one Muslim where we had</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.870" end="01:21:11.330" style="s2">fixed them up and then one mixed where</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.540" end="01:21:13.700" style="s2">we had also fixed them up one jewel in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.330" end="01:21:17.860" style="s2">Muslim so the subject of Islam and</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.700" end="01:21:21.830" style="s2">terror came up and the table split</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.860" end="01:21:22.940" style="s2">straight down the middle with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.830" end="01:21:26.180" style="s2">whether there was a connection between</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.940" end="01:21:28.640" style="s2">Islam and terror with Jews on one side</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.180" end="01:21:30.440" style="s2">and Muslims on the other and the Jews</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.640" end="01:21:32.860" style="s2">were all saying this is a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.440" end="01:21:36.770" style="s2">blood libel that Muslims have been</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.860" end="01:21:39.440" style="s2">tarred with and the Muslims said what</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.770" end="01:21:42.050" style="s2">the hell is your problem Jews this is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:44.180" style="s2">serious problem in our community and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.050" end="01:21:45.710" style="s2">better wake up to the fact that this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.180" end="01:21:47.750" style="s2">something you have to be able to talk</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.710" end="01:21:49.310" style="s2">about and it was very strange because we</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.750" end="01:21:52.130" style="s2">were each doing the work of the other</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.310" end="01:21:53.780" style="s2">community interests I have not had I</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.130" end="01:21:56.030" style="s2">haven&#39;t had that problem because as I</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.780" end="01:21:59.960" style="s2">said given that so many of my members</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.030" end="01:22:02.540" style="s2">grew up in Iran they have no problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.960" end="01:22:06.380" style="s2">talking about what their perception is</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.540" end="01:22:10.910" style="s2">and they consider Iran in particular to</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.380" end="01:22:13.850" style="s2">be the the great rogue state and the the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.910" end="01:22:16.400" style="s2">leadership of Iran to be as dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.850" end="01:22:19.010" style="s2">virtually anything in the world although</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.400" end="01:22:19.580" style="s2">many of them not all but many of them</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.010" end="01:22:21.980" style="s2">have a law</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.580" end="01:22:23.810" style="s2">confidence in or at least a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.980" end="01:22:24.800" style="s2">affection for the people and think that</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.810" end="01:22:27.530" style="s2">they&#39;re very different from their</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.800" end="01:22:29.360" style="s2">government well that certainly that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.530" end="01:22:34.790" style="s2">the case but the other issue with Iran</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.360" end="01:22:36.320" style="s2">let&#39;s be honest is that Persians are one</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.790" end="01:22:37.580" style="s2">of the most accomplished people in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.320" end="01:22:39.950" style="s2">face of the earth yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.580" end="01:22:41.870" style="s2">they are excellent game players and they</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.950" end="01:22:45.170" style="s2">are a force to be reckoned with and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.870" end="01:22:48.110" style="s2">there is a certain kind of respect that</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.170" end="01:22:51.770" style="s2">one has to have for Iran as a major</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.110" end="01:22:54.560" style="s2">intellectual cultural and military</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.770" end="01:22:58.030" style="s2">powerhouse and so the part of the fear</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.560" end="01:23:03.260" style="s2">of Iran comes out of a reverence for</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.030" end="01:23:05.090" style="s2">Persian culture what I what I want to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.260" end="01:23:07.070" style="s2">is to try to get out of this black and</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.090" end="01:23:10.820" style="s2">white thinking so that we are actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.070" end="01:23:13.490" style="s2">able to talk about different problems of</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.820" end="01:23:14.960" style="s2">these communities and to say here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.490" end="01:23:17.390" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s good here&#39;s what&#39;s bad for</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.960" end="01:23:20.120" style="s2">example one of the things that I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.390" end="01:23:24.920" style="s2">you and I both struggle with is how to</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.120" end="01:23:28.490" style="s2">talk about the need that you and I may</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.920" end="01:23:32.090" style="s2">feel to support Israel you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.490" end="01:23:35.390" style="s2">context of being somewhat open about</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.090" end="01:23:38.870" style="s2">Israel&#39;s various failings and brutal</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.390" end="01:23:40.760" style="s2">isms of a community that it should not</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.870" end="01:23:42.950" style="s2">and does not wish to be occupied right</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.760" end="01:23:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to talk about Israel</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.950" end="01:23:51.140" style="s2">these days in any kind of any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.600" end="01:23:54.950" style="s2">sophisticated way because the camps are</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.140" end="01:23:59.480" style="s2">so as you said that they&#39;re so polarized</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.950" end="01:24:01.580" style="s2">and and and also the stakes for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.480" end="01:24:05.120" style="s2">sides are so high yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.580" end="01:24:08.690" style="s2">it&#39;s that kind of political conversation</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.120" end="01:24:13.960" style="s2">gets overwhelmed by the loudest voices</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.690" end="01:24:17.510" style="s2">on each side of the conversation and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.960" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s very hard and it and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.510" end="01:24:21.890" style="s2">invariably it doesn&#39;t take place in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:25.040" style="s2">vacuum</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.890" end="01:24:26.360" style="s2">I mean look even the israel-palestinian</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.040" end="01:24:28.100" style="s2">issue doesn&#39;t take place in a vacuum</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.360" end="01:24:31.010" style="s2">it&#39;s part of a much larger picture of</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.100" end="01:24:32.810" style="s2">the Middle East in general and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.010" end="01:24:35.030" style="s2">know talk about the Ottoman</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.810" end="01:24:38.030" style="s2">Palestinian issue yeah exactly Indian</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.030" end="01:24:41.330" style="s2">pals that&#39;s right I know which is really</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.030" end="01:24:43.760" style="s2">important and and also because what</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.330" end="01:24:47.600" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize mati Friedman who</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.760" end="01:24:50.360" style="s2">is a journalist in Israel and an author</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.600" end="01:24:53.060" style="s2">of several really fine books talks about</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.360" end="01:24:54.770" style="s2">this a lot is that that half of Israel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.060" end="01:24:56.390" style="s2">population comes from the Middle East we</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.770" end="01:24:58.550" style="s2">think of it as sort of Europe sitting in</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.390" end="01:24:59.780" style="s2">the Middle East but it&#39;s not the culture</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.550" end="01:25:00.980" style="s2">is from the Middle East the music is</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.780" end="01:25:03.740" style="s2">from the Middle East the food is from</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.980" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">the Middle East and so it&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.740" end="01:25:08.240" style="s2">some ways he says this to be a little</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:11.360" style="s2">provocative but it&#39;s somewhat true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.240" end="01:25:15.320" style="s2">partly a creation of the Arab states who</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.360" end="01:25:18.170" style="s2">after all expelled their Jews who ran to</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.320" end="01:25:21.320" style="s2">Israel and so there&#39;s this larger mosaic</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.170" end="01:25:23.030" style="s2">of a struggle all through the Middle</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.320" end="01:25:26.090" style="s2">East about what kind of culture will be</p>

<p begin="01:27:28.570" end="01:27:33.820" style="s2">you realize it&#39;s a much more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.010" end="01:27:36.250" style="s2">situation that in in Bombay where my</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.820" end="01:27:37.810" style="s2">wife is from you know you get into</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.250" end="01:27:39.220" style="s2">conversations with people and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.810" end="01:27:42.430" style="s2">like here&#39;s the good stuff we got from</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.220" end="01:27:44.890" style="s2">the Brits here&#39;s the bad stuff this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.430" end="01:27:47.140" style="s2">the same for me with Israel I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.890" end="01:27:48.580" style="s2">to have to say hey you know we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.140" end="01:27:50.260" style="s2">moral we&#39;re so wonderful we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.580" end="01:27:53.620" style="s2">everything perfectly because we have it</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.260" end="01:27:56.560" style="s2">right but it doesn&#39;t negate the need to</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.620" end="01:27:59.320" style="s2">support the state I understand why it is</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.560" end="01:28:00.910" style="s2">that I&#39;m in some situation where people</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.320" end="01:28:02.170" style="s2">say well don&#39;t you realize that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.910" end="01:28:04.660" style="s2">done this that and the other horrible</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.170" end="01:28:08.500" style="s2">thing so you know you should be against</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.660" end="01:28:11.350" style="s2">right yes well I mean this guy I would</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.500" end="01:28:14.260" style="s2">say if there&#39;s one underlying theme that</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.350" end="01:28:16.510" style="s2">has run through the I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.260" end="01:28:21.280" style="s2">long we&#39;ve this we&#39;ve been podcasting</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.510" end="01:28:22.960" style="s2">but how our years but but just like in</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.280" end="01:28:27.130" style="s2">the desert every single day has been</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.960" end="01:28:30.310" style="s2">meaningful but if there&#39;s one theme it</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.130" end="01:28:33.820" style="s2">is the rejection of absolutism and</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.310" end="01:28:36.940" style="s2">simplicity for complexity and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.820" end="01:28:40.660" style="s2">willingness to hold two sides and say</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.940" end="01:28:45.270" style="s2">they&#39;re both valid and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.660" end="01:28:50.170" style="s2">think we have lost increasingly in this</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.270" end="01:28:53.080" style="s2">culture is that everybody everybody is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.170" end="01:28:56.470" style="s2">crusader for for the black and the white</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.080" end="01:28:59.590" style="s2">and not for all the shades in between</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.470" end="01:29:02.680" style="s2">which is really where all of us</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.590" end="01:29:04.300" style="s2">for most of our lives we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.680" end="01:29:06.850" style="s2">apply it to the great issues but we need</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.300" end="01:29:10.870" style="s2">to alright I&#39;ve got two more topics and</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.850" end="01:29:14.490" style="s2">then uh let&#39;s yeah okay okay first one</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.870" end="01:29:18.550" style="s2">is kind of a dangerous one which is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.490" end="01:29:20.950" style="s2">I&#39;m watching the Holocaust survivors in</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.550" end="01:29:23.320" style="s2">my life dwindle to a handful and mostly</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.950" end="01:29:26.260" style="s2">they were child right children during</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.320" end="01:29:28.960" style="s2">the period yeah I am increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.260" end="01:29:30.850" style="s2">convinced that we are wasting the</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.960" end="01:29:38.040" style="s2">twilight of living memory of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.850" end="01:29:41.590" style="s2">Holocaust by not approaching Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.040" end="01:29:46.570" style="s2">offering a much deeper reconciliation</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.590" end="01:29:49.120" style="s2">than we have today that in some sense we</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.570" end="01:29:51.940" style="s2">got bound up we Jews got bound up in</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.120" end="01:29:53.470" style="s2">German culture obviously British</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.940" end="01:29:56.800" style="s2">language is Middle High German of so</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.470" end="01:29:58.840" style="s2">yeah infused with yes we benefited a</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.800" end="01:30:02.140" style="s2">great deal from Germanic and Teutonic</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.840" end="01:30:04.270" style="s2">Fayette and they benefited a great deal</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.140" end="01:30:07.300" style="s2">right from having us as a community</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.270" end="01:30:09.280" style="s2">attached to them no question we were in</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.300" end="01:30:12.730" style="s2">some sense may have been too similar and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.280" end="01:30:15.040" style="s2">caused some problems because if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.730" end="01:30:20.680" style="s2">think about the German contribution 1700</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.040" end="01:30:24.340" style="s2">1800s incomparable yes should we be</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.680" end="01:30:27.730" style="s2">using this time before the last who</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.340" end="01:30:30.160" style="s2">remember this period to come up with a</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.730" end="01:30:31.570" style="s2">deeper reconciliation between the two</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.160" end="01:30:35.500" style="s2">cold I&#39;m not sure what that would look</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.570" end="01:30:38.710" style="s2">like if you would so for example you</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.500" end="01:30:40.750" style="s2">know klezmer the Jewish jazz yes died</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.710" end="01:30:45.730" style="s2">out pretty much has a tiny cannon</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.750" end="01:30:48.190" style="s2">unrecorded material and it got</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.730" end="01:30:51.010" style="s2">revitalized because Germans were went to</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.190" end="01:30:52.750" style="s2">pay for modern right so what but but</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.010" end="01:30:54.580" style="s2">what did but what would it mean I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.750" end="01:30:57.610" style="s2">what are we not doing that we should do</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.580" end="01:30:59.890" style="s2">we should encourage Jews to travel to</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.610" end="01:31:03.400" style="s2">Germany we should I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.890" end="01:31:05.350" style="s2">pretty close relationship of Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.400" end="01:31:08.740" style="s2">Israel for example yeah I&#39;m talking a</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.350" end="01:31:12.289" style="s2">more personal relationship I feel very</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.740" end="01:31:15.409" style="s2">weird about right about the connection I</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.289" end="01:31:17.780" style="s2">don&#39;t feel I Drive a Volkswagen I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.409" end="01:31:19.599" style="s2">feel really comfortable with it I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.780" end="01:31:22.519" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of ceremonial</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.599" end="01:31:25.039" style="s2">ritualistic thing of letting younger I</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.519" end="01:31:27.829" style="s2">worried about the German guilt in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.039" end="01:31:30.530" style="s2">whole migration crisis where Germans are</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.829" end="01:31:32.089" style="s2">still saying we are not Nazis right and</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.530" end="01:31:33.349" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at these people and saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.089" end="01:31:35.809" style="s2">you know you&#39;re maybe something</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.349" end="01:31:38.149" style="s2">problematic in the cultural lineage yes</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.809" end="01:31:39.709" style="s2">but don&#39;t overdo the guilt because</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.149" end="01:31:41.479" style="s2">that&#39;s going to snap back on</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.709" end="01:31:42.979" style="s2">I do remember years ago I went to</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.479" end="01:31:44.510" style="s2">Germany as part of a delegation of</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.979" end="01:31:47.030" style="s2">Jewish leaders with from the cotton</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.510" end="01:31:50.030" style="s2">Konrad Adenauer foundation and it was an</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.030" end="01:31:55.010" style="s2">amazing trip and I don&#39;t know if they</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.030" end="01:31:57.319" style="s2">still do that but I just I think that</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.010" end="01:31:59.510" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re up against a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.319" end="01:32:02.629" style="s2">problem which is that Americans in</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.510" end="01:32:05.139" style="s2">general and American Jews also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.629" end="01:32:10.299" style="s2">connect to any foreign country</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.139" end="01:32:14.569" style="s2">particularly we are so I had a group of</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.299" end="01:32:16.309" style="s2">this pass about I don&#39;t know three four</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.569" end="01:32:19.429" style="s2">months ago Frank Luntz brought a group</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.309" end="01:32:20.749" style="s2">from NYU Abu Dhabi so if there were</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.429" end="01:32:22.339" style="s2">students from all over the world and</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.749" end="01:32:23.419" style="s2">most of them from the Middle East they</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.339" end="01:32:24.439" style="s2">brought them to the synagogue and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.419" end="01:32:26.719" style="s2">spoke to them about a range of issues</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.439" end="01:32:28.459" style="s2">and one of them said to me what makes a</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.719" end="01:32:31.280" style="s2">merit what what&#39;s America&#39;s greatest</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.459" end="01:32:35.289" style="s2">blessing or its greatest gift and I said</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.280" end="01:32:38.329" style="s2">that&#39;s easy Canada Mexico ocean ocean I</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.289" end="01:32:40.369" style="s2">said more than anything else because</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.329" end="01:32:42.889" style="s2">think of where you live and how you have</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.369" end="01:32:45.639" style="s2">all these different you know competing</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.889" end="01:32:47.899" style="s2">cultures around you I said we have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.639" end="01:32:50.359" style="s2">really I mean yes we once had a war with</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.899" end="01:32:52.369" style="s2">Mexico but we have two countries on our</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.359" end="01:32:54.260" style="s2">border that pose absolutely no threat to</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.369" end="01:32:56.389" style="s2">us immigration aside I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.260" end="01:33:00.169" style="s2">threat threat no the military threat</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.389" end="01:33:02.929" style="s2">masked right on the border and and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.169" end="01:33:07.789" style="s2">oceans have never attacked us except</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.929" end="01:33:09.559" style="s2">once in Jaws that was it so the so the</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.789" end="01:33:11.749" style="s2">the isolation of that&#39;s why Americans</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.559" end="01:33:13.639" style="s2">don&#39;t speak foreign languages that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.749" end="01:33:16.099" style="s2">we don&#39;t generally know foreign</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.639" end="01:33:19.399" style="s2">countries very well and that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.099" end="01:33:21.289" style="s2">part of the reason why we haven&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.399" end="01:33:23.149" style="s2">to know Germany better I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.289" end="01:33:25.280" style="s2">to do with that even than with a</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.149" end="01:33:26.929" style="s2">cultural reluctance to do it</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.280" end="01:33:29.270" style="s2">that if we don&#39;t get to know Germany</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.929" end="01:33:30.800" style="s2">better as you say we will not come to</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.270" end="01:33:32.570" style="s2">understand ourselves I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.800" end="01:33:35.150" style="s2">lot of our history I was bound up and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.570" end="01:33:39.619" style="s2">believe that a guilty Germany is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.150" end="01:33:42.469" style="s2">danger to the planet and that we release</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.619" end="01:33:46.010" style="s2">modern Germans from some of the horror</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.469" end="01:33:48.920" style="s2">of the guilt because it wasn&#39;t them to</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.010" end="01:33:50.619" style="s2">know modern Germany German is guilty I</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.920" end="01:33:53.289" style="s2">mean unless maybe they&#39;re in their 90&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.619" end="01:33:56.989" style="s2">but well that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying last</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.289" end="01:33:58.550" style="s2">yeah but anybody under I guess 80 I</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.989" end="01:34:00.619" style="s2">don&#39;t know that I have to do the exact</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.550" end="01:34:03.559" style="s2">the reason that&#39;s on my mind is I just</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.619" end="01:34:05.449" style="s2">yeah I I had thought that I might open</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.559" end="01:34:08.210" style="s2">the podcast with a cousin I had never</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.449" end="01:34:10.849" style="s2">met Eva Kor who was a Mengele twin who</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.210" end="01:34:12.770" style="s2">forgave Mengele Wow and I just spoke to</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.849" end="01:34:14.449" style="s2">her and she said yeah I&#39;ll do it when I</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.770" end="01:34:16.699" style="s2">come back all right and then she went to</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.449" end="01:34:19.789" style="s2">Auschwitz for her annual pilgrimage and</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.699" end="01:34:22.789" style="s2">she died in Poland on the trip Wow so</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.789" end="01:34:25.250" style="s2">I&#39;m it&#39;s very much on my mind right I</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.789" end="01:34:26.809" style="s2">will be there actually this year I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.250" end="01:34:29.300" style="s2">doing the march of the living you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.809" end="01:34:31.099" style="s2">what March or April right after I do it</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.300" end="01:34:33.079" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do it this year I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.099" end="01:34:36.650" style="s2">done it so and what&#39;s the second issue</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.079" end="01:34:40.130" style="s2">the last question the lash yes let me</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.650" end="01:34:43.429" style="s2">imagine that we were able to learn our</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.130" end="01:34:46.460" style="s2">own source code in physics mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.429" end="01:34:49.969" style="s2">that at after this whatever this final</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.460" end="01:34:52.280" style="s2">theory might be yeah there was no reason</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.969" end="01:34:55.010" style="s2">to keep searching mathematically for a</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.280" end="01:34:57.619" style="s2">more complete theory how would that</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.010" end="01:35:01.969" style="s2">affect potentially your relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.619" end="01:35:03.829" style="s2">Judaism and can you conceive of what the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.969" end="01:35:07.520" style="s2">kind of shape and nature of such a</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.829" end="01:35:10.070" style="s2">theory would be scientifically so that</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.520" end="01:35:13.010" style="s2">we stopped asking for further</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.070" end="01:35:16.760" style="s2">refinements and to push further so I</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.010" end="01:35:18.440" style="s2">think first of all for me to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.760" end="01:35:21.590" style="s2">about what a final theory in physics</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.440" end="01:35:23.809" style="s2">would look like is is it presumption</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.590" end="01:35:25.789" style="s2">that all your listeners just must be</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.809" end="01:35:28.070" style="s2">cracking up at their bomb that</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.789" end="01:35:30.710" style="s2">transcendent signs the sir but I I mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.070" end="01:35:32.570" style="s2">I like I always liked the Robert Jastrow</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.710" end="01:35:34.159" style="s2">image which you may know that he said</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.570" end="01:35:36.110" style="s2">when physicists you know climb that</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.159" end="01:35:37.550" style="s2">final mountain they&#39;re gonna find God</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.110" end="01:35:38.420" style="s2">looking at them from the other side I</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.550" end="01:35:39.470" style="s2">know your role</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.420" end="01:35:41.630" style="s2">your eyes I don&#39;t know if people</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.470" end="01:35:43.580" style="s2">listening can see that I always liked it</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.630" end="01:35:47.120" style="s2">I liked the image come on a little</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.580" end="01:35:51.050" style="s2">poetry in your physics oh I am sure you</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.120" end="01:35:55.070" style="s2">can I have no doubt about that look I</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.050" end="01:35:56.420" style="s2">think that the I have I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.070" end="01:36:00.980" style="s2">that it&#39;s possible and I&#39;ll tell you why</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.420" end="01:36:05.030" style="s2">I say that I have a deep and abiding</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.980" end="01:36:08.390" style="s2">faith in the limitations of the human</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.030" end="01:36:11.630" style="s2">mind and by that I don&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.390" end="01:36:15.020" style="s2">can&#39;t do astonishing things but part</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.630" end="01:36:16.750" style="s2">when I ask people sometimes this is how</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.020" end="01:36:19.820" style="s2">you can tell if you&#39;re religious</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.750" end="01:36:22.220" style="s2">is there a mystery at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.820" end="01:36:23.780" style="s2">world not a puzzle but a mystery because</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.220" end="01:36:26.210" style="s2">a puzzle you can figure out but a</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.780" end="01:36:27.710" style="s2">mystery is is in principle unfit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.210" end="01:36:29.960" style="s2">out of both sort of what I&#39;m asking and</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.710" end="01:36:31.760" style="s2">and I really believe that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.960" end="01:36:34.340" style="s2">mystery at the heart of the universe not</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.760" end="01:36:36.200" style="s2">a puzzle so that we won&#39;t ever have the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.340" end="01:36:38.120" style="s2">kind of final theory that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.200" end="01:36:39.740" style="s2">about because the world is created by</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.120" end="01:36:40.940" style="s2">something infinitely greater than</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.740" end="01:36:46.160" style="s2">anything we can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.940" end="01:36:48.740" style="s2">I when I have to talk about God to high</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.160" end="01:36:52.190" style="s2">school kids for example and I tell them</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.740" end="01:36:54.440" style="s2">look I have I have no idea what God is I</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.190" end="01:36:57.170" style="s2">have no idea I said think of it this way</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.440" end="01:36:59.300" style="s2">when you were 2 years old could you have</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.170" end="01:37:00.410" style="s2">imagined what a 14-year old is not only</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.300" end="01:37:01.940" style="s2">could you not have imagined it you</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.410" end="01:37:04.820" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have imagined what it is that</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.940" end="01:37:07.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t imagine so I assume that</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.820" end="01:37:10.970" style="s2">whatever is out there that whatever is</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.970" end="01:37:13.400" style="s2">ultimate is so far beyond anything that</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.970" end="01:37:19.010" style="s2">I or any human being can conceive of</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.400" end="01:37:20.480" style="s2">that I think our fate is to always</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.010" end="01:37:23.210" style="s2">search and be more and more and more</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.480" end="01:37:25.610" style="s2">comprehensive but never to achieve the</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.210" end="01:37:27.110" style="s2">kind of finality that you are that is</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.610" end="01:37:29.240" style="s2">suggested by your question see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.110" end="01:37:31.940" style="s2">really weird to me I&#39;ll give you two</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.240" end="01:37:34.580" style="s2">examples of why it doesn&#39;t work okay for</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.940" end="01:37:36.260" style="s2">me yes I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong the</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.580" end="01:37:38.480" style="s2">first is the number of different</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.260" end="01:37:41.540" style="s2">phenomena that were encompassed by</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.480" end="01:37:43.940" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s equations I can really write</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.540" end="01:37:46.400" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s equations in a modern context</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.940" end="01:37:48.740" style="s2">in one line doesn&#39;t require four</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.400" end="01:37:50.630" style="s2">different equations and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.740" end="01:37:54.080" style="s2">stuff about x-rays and</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.630" end="01:37:56.120" style="s2">UV and visible light and magnetism</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.080" end="01:37:58.070" style="s2">electricity it&#39;s all subsumed in this</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.120" end="01:38:01.280" style="s2">one damn equation okay so there are</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.070" end="01:38:03.830" style="s2">these condensations where you realize</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.280" end="01:38:06.409" style="s2">that it&#39;s much simpler than you ever</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.830" end="01:38:08.659" style="s2">imagined so one I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.409" end="01:38:11.270" style="s2">discounting the amount of unification</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.659" end="01:38:13.520" style="s2">the idea that every living thing is</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.270" end="01:38:16.280" style="s2">predicated on 20 amino acids and four</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.520" end="01:38:17.750" style="s2">nucleotides so far as we know or that</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.280" end="01:38:19.909" style="s2">everything that you see out there is</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.750" end="01:38:21.170" style="s2">just up quarks down quarks electrons and</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.909" end="01:38:24.830" style="s2">whatever we use to stick them together</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.170" end="01:38:27.260" style="s2">it looks very varied but the the set is</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.830" end="01:38:30.260" style="s2">very pretty small the other thing I</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.260" end="01:38:31.969" style="s2">might say is imagine that you begin in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.260" end="01:38:34.010" style="s2">neighborhood and you&#39;re exploring the</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.969" end="01:38:36.500" style="s2">planet and every time you walk in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.010" end="01:38:38.510" style="s2">direction you find new wondrous magical</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.500" end="01:38:41.270" style="s2">things you&#39;ve never seen before yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.510" end="01:38:44.270" style="s2">you will incorrectly infer that if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.270" end="01:38:47.679" style="s2">keep walking it will always be thus and</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.270" end="01:38:49.850" style="s2">there you won&#39;t see the age of Internet</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.679" end="01:38:50.510" style="s2">intercontinental exploration come to a</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.850" end="01:38:52.760" style="s2">close</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.510" end="01:38:54.710" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve discounted both of those</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.760" end="01:39:00.560" style="s2">things well what I am what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.710" end="01:39:02.000" style="s2">to you is 500 years ago you were in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.560" end="01:39:03.230" style="s2">position of that two-year-old you</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.000" end="01:39:05.840" style="s2">couldn&#39;t imagine what you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.230" end="01:39:09.830" style="s2">imagine the Maxwell&#39;s equations would</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.840" end="01:39:12.770" style="s2">answer or that I mean look I think about</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.830" end="01:39:13.820" style="s2">I think about when I was a kid and we</p>

<p begin="01:39:37.010" end="01:39:42.850" style="s2">close to the end and what I think is</p>

<p begin="01:39:53.810" end="01:39:58.909" style="s2">is there&#39;s a question about going down</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.360" end="01:40:00.920" style="s2">yeah towards the foundations there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.909" end="01:40:04.490" style="s2">question about going up towards the</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.920" end="01:40:06.860" style="s2">consequences I will agree that if we go</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.490" end="01:40:08.360" style="s2">towards the foundations that tells us</p>

<p begin="01:40:15.830" end="01:40:20.480" style="s2">what are you asking me about how I</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.050" end="01:40:22.190" style="s2">envision a final theater well I bet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.480" end="01:40:24.110" style="s2">math would that it would be mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.190" end="01:40:25.850" style="s2">that it would be presumably they know</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.110" end="01:40:27.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve added my name up with a theory of</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.850" end="01:40:30.080" style="s2">everything right when you hear the words</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.950" end="01:40:32.240" style="s2">theory of everything I mean I always</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.080" end="01:40:34.850" style="s2">think that the physicists who traffic in</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.240" end="01:40:37.610" style="s2">that have never thought through the</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.850" end="01:40:39.730" style="s2">question of assume that you actually you</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.610" end="01:40:43.040" style="s2">know that the dog caught the car yes</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.730" end="01:40:46.970" style="s2">would do you have any idea of what that</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.040" end="01:40:49.850" style="s2">would even look like because to say this</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.970" end="01:40:52.010" style="s2">is complete does it have no biggie you</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.850" end="01:40:54.140" style="s2">say unmoved mover the the like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.010" end="01:40:55.730" style="s2">no boundary condition I mean you give</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.140" end="01:40:57.290" style="s2">you an idea of how crazy this is let me</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.730" end="01:40:59.180" style="s2">give you my version of God since you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.290" end="01:41:03.650" style="s2">given me some indication of yours okay</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.180" end="01:41:05.960" style="s2">guys I believe that God starts off being</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.650" end="01:41:08.260" style="s2">a boundary condition being a design</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.960" end="01:41:11.180" style="s2">constraint completely inanimate</p>

<p begin="01:41:13.760" end="01:41:18.410" style="s2">and you reach the end and God is there</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.950" end="01:41:20.720" style="s2">is is that it mistakes the magic that I</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.410" end="01:41:23.000" style="s2">think might happen which is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.720" end="01:41:25.820" style="s2">worrying right now about artificial</p>

<p begin="01:41:30.890" end="01:41:37.760" style="s2">theory is true right this bubbled up</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.640" end="01:41:40.790" style="s2">emergently right and that when we learn</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.760" end="01:41:43.370" style="s2">our own source code is that what</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.790" end="01:41:46.340" style="s2">effectively creates a meaningful version</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.370" end="01:41:48.440" style="s2">of God because it started out inanimate</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.340" end="01:41:49.730" style="s2">and that we are that which will animate</p>
