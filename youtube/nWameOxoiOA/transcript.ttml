<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">conceptualization of psychology as</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">discipline I think is relevant to his</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">work into mine but let&#39;s let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">with this let&#39;s start with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">transgender participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:16.790" style="s2">and I normally start from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">propositional because that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.790" end="00:02:19.909" style="s2">people are familiar and worked down to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:21.709" style="s2">the integral but I want to start to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.909" end="00:02:24.140" style="s2">the other way and I want to brick with</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.709" end="00:02:25.819" style="s2">you let&#39;s do some jazz and see let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.140" end="00:02:26.329" style="s2">if it works better that way because amen</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.819" end="00:02:27.829" style="s2">brother</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.329" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">yeah well yeah because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.829" end="00:02:32.629" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the appropriate expertise and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:37.129" style="s2">depth of understanding to be good on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.629" end="00:02:39.950" style="s2">good interlocutor and partner so did the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.129" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">know one way I try to sometimes get</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.950" end="00:02:43.129" style="s2">started with the participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:45.349" style="s2">is I pick up on bacon Stein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.129" end="00:02:47.060" style="s2">idea that even though Mayans could talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.349" end="00:02:49.579" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t understand them so even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.060" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">they could you know use propositions</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.579" end="00:02:53.780" style="s2">with the correct syntax and everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.230" end="00:02:55.819" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t get them and the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.780" end="00:02:58.549" style="s2">that is because they don&#39;t have our form</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.819" end="00:03:00.109" style="s2">of life the form of life is not a state</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.549" end="00:03:02.389" style="s2">of consciousness that&#39;s why it&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.109" end="00:03:05.359" style="s2">than perspective amore and what is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.389" end="00:03:07.430" style="s2">does that mean well it means it means it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.359" end="00:03:09.139" style="s2">for I think for us as human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.430" end="00:03:11.239" style="s2">this is what something beyond lines it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.139" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">means these these these things at least</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.239" end="00:03:17.410" style="s2">there is we we are deeply historical and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:19.639" style="s2">not just culturally historical we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.410" end="00:03:23.090" style="s2">evolutionary history and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.639" end="00:03:25.819" style="s2">mean that means that evolution has done</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:28.160" style="s2">this process of what&#39;s called you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.819" end="00:03:29.569" style="s2">nice construction yeah we&#39;re organism</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.160" end="00:03:31.849" style="s2">shaped their environment and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.569" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">environment shapes the organisms so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.849" end="00:03:34.790" style="s2">you have is you have mutual shaping</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:37.970" style="s2">right you have got some virtual shaping</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2">and the idea is that mutual shaping that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.970" end="00:03:43.699" style="s2">niche construction that generates</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">affordances it patterns of real</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.699" end="00:03:48.109" style="s2">connection with in which relevance</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:50.090" style="s2">realization intelligence can occur</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.109" end="00:03:54.079" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have that mutual</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.090" end="00:03:56.180" style="s2">shaping by biology you&#39;re just lost in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.079" end="00:03:58.129" style="s2">combinatorial explosion right completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.180" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a that frames it and then flows</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.129" end="00:04:04.609" style="s2">it yes exactly exactly and then of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.620" end="00:04:06.889" style="s2">course on top of the biological shaping</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.609" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">mutual shaping in each construction that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.889" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">we share with lines of course we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:13.310" style="s2">cultural type here shapes us right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:16.820" style="s2">the culture if you have go ahead right</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.310" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">can clean because my basic psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.820" end="00:04:24.039" style="s2">language which say on top of our basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">animal psychology yeah okay we have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.039" end="00:04:28.750" style="s2">chiral</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:31.000" style="s2">it&#39;s consciousness and art so in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.750" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">words you use the word biology there you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.000" end="00:04:36.970" style="s2">know my language is actually that&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">okay at the level of the animal mind at</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.970" end="00:04:41.259" style="s2">the level the animal is corresponds to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">basic psychology refuse the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.259" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">proper procedural and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:50.949" style="s2">intuitive interactive behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:53.650" style="s2">investment flow okay and then on top of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.949" end="00:04:55.780" style="s2">that we are cultural persons that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.650" end="00:04:58.090" style="s2">justify our actions in a secondary</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.780" end="00:05:00.819" style="s2">reflective stance and that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.090" end="00:05:02.500" style="s2">problem distich propositional systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.819" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">and actors I think this is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.500" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">parallel I think so let me say some more</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:15.729" style="s2">and then no no I think I want you to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:17.979" style="s2">that you so what I was going to say is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.729" end="00:05:19.780" style="s2">you know cultural is a mutual shaping to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.979" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">we shape the environment to fit us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.780" end="00:05:22.659" style="s2">we shape ourselves to fit the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:24.130" style="s2">environment that&#39;s that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.659" end="00:05:26.440" style="s2">expense culture shock when you go</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.130" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">somewhere else all right so you you you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.440" end="00:05:32.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know your biological fitness as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">set of beliefs it&#39;s not even a state of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.440" end="00:05:37.240" style="s2">consciousness right it&#39;s you participate</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:39.159" style="s2">in it hence the term participatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.240" end="00:05:41.699" style="s2">knowing you participate in these</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.159" end="00:05:44.949" style="s2">construction you participate in cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.699" end="00:05:47.020" style="s2">right cultural coordination that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.949" end="00:05:48.969" style="s2">will heal to admit that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.020" end="00:05:53.050" style="s2">about and then above and beyond that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.969" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">have cognitive mutual shaping and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.050" end="00:05:57.069" style="s2">what I&#39;m having right is I&#39;m constantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.569" style="s2">you can even see this and you know our</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.069" end="00:06:01.210" style="s2">levels of sort of probability and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.569" end="00:06:03.370" style="s2">conditioning because the organism is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.210" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">just the idea that that&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.370" end="00:06:07.690" style="s2">associational I think is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:09.190" style="s2">miss thinking of the data right right</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.690" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">you agree with me on that so morning we</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">don&#39;t need to get into discovery so no</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:16.300" style="s2">yeah I mean evolution creates the frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:18.009" style="s2">of adaptation and then there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.009" end="00:06:22.840" style="s2">operon well yeah but I even say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.099" end="00:06:24.310" style="s2">even at the level of the conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.840" end="00:06:25.690" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually seeing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.310" end="00:06:27.580" style="s2">with no coming out and some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.690" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">sophisticated modeling right is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.580" end="00:06:31.479" style="s2">not you&#39;re not seeing Association your</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:34.449" style="s2">people have moved no no what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.479" end="00:06:36.070" style="s2">seeing is prediction right and right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.449" end="00:06:37.779" style="s2">then and then and there&#39;s more people</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.070" end="00:06:38.620" style="s2">are now pointing out well it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.779" end="00:06:40.600" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.620" end="00:06:43.750" style="s2">what you&#39;re seeing is prediction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.600" end="00:06:44.740" style="s2">it fused with preparation the organism</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.750" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">is just sort of predicting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.740" end="00:06:50.110" style="s2">environment it&#39;s also preparing so right</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:52.600" style="s2">and what does that mean the organism has</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.110" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">some implicit model of itself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.600" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2">activating the appropriate skills given</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:58.390" style="s2">that self model and given the prediction</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:00.100" style="s2">of the environment and all of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.390" end="00:07:02.350" style="s2">happening now what does that what does</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.100" end="00:07:05.380" style="s2">that mean you&#39;re simultaneously right</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.350" end="00:07:06.970" style="s2">your creatures are aspectual izing the</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.970" end="00:07:11.620" style="s2">cognitively but they&#39;re also shaping</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.310" end="00:07:13.810" style="s2">themselves as a here&#39;s the sequence of</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.750" end="00:07:21.580" style="s2">to get up to looker right so once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.660" end="00:07:24.850" style="s2">getting up to that level right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.580" end="00:07:28.930" style="s2">where the participatory knowing now acts</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.850" end="00:07:31.090" style="s2">as a constraining matrix within which</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.930" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">the prospective all-knowing unfolds as</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.090" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">you said within that once I have the</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.940" end="00:07:57.250" style="s2">salience landscape it is it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.820" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">more adverbial than adjectives all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.250" end="00:08:02.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a procedural and the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.120" style="s2">and the point about both of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.020" end="00:08:06.310" style="s2">throughout that description is all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.120" end="00:08:09.100" style="s2">that is transgender</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.930" end="00:08:38.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we get things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:42.490" style="s2">imaginal constructs that can then</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.700" end="00:08:44.980" style="s2">intersect and create potential right for</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.490" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">transfected participatory symbols like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.980" end="00:08:48.220" style="s2">the symbol of justice that then creates</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">a particular kind of frame that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.220" end="00:08:51.880" style="s2">integrates a lot and allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:54.310" style="s2">participate with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.880" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s well said so the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.310" end="00:09:02.530" style="s2">imagine that we&#39;re using korbin sturm</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">which which I got where did I get I got</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.530" end="00:09:07.210" style="s2">to talk to Tom Thomas Cheetham we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:10.180" style="s2">we recorded a video together about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.210" end="00:09:10.630" style="s2">Corbin yeah so the note that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.180" end="00:09:14.050" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.630" end="00:09:16.660" style="s2">the imaginal it differs from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.050" end="00:09:18.700" style="s2">imaginary imaginary in the imaginal is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.660" end="00:09:22.600" style="s2">not just a horizontal relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.700" end="00:09:23.890" style="s2">some fictional object the imaginal if</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.600" end="00:09:26.170" style="s2">you allow me this metaphor is also</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.890" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">vertical it&#39;s designed to access and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.170" end="00:09:30.670" style="s2">activate right these deeper levels of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:32.470" style="s2">knowing bringing us interact respectable</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.670" end="00:09:35.050" style="s2">and ultimately participatory knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.470" end="00:09:37.720" style="s2">something and yeah so because ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:39.970" style="s2">but this goes I think to the court of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.720" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2">the point Greg ultimately we want a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.970" end="00:09:44.980" style="s2">participatory and perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.040" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">of justice not not just just</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.980" end="00:09:49.030" style="s2">propositional floor even procedural and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:56.620" style="s2">the more procedural we need all of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.030" end="00:09:58.150" style="s2">yeah it all look good exactly here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.620" end="00:10:01.210" style="s2">another thing that actually will connect</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.150" end="00:10:03.160" style="s2">about what we need okay so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.210" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">psychotherapy there&#39;s an unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.160" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">debate about you know empirically</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:10.870" style="s2">supported treatments for example okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">well what you just said I think connects</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.870" end="00:10:15.910" style="s2">actually immediately to a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:18.310" style="s2">debate okay in the field which is when</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.910" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2">we started the field starts to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.310" end="00:10:21.580" style="s2">empirically supported treatments it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.260" end="00:10:24.520" style="s2">actually trying to create a set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.580" end="00:10:27.520" style="s2">propositions and procedures okay that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.520" end="00:10:30.820" style="s2">are then enacted upon some system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.520" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">when it&#39;s a recipe its propositional and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.820" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">procedural which is very impersonal and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">not IDEO graphic in the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.690" style="s2">participatory relation between two</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:42.820" style="s2">unique individuals which is why the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.690" end="00:10:46.810" style="s2">humanists went crazy in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.820" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">trying to impose a code on an</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.810" end="00:10:50.110" style="s2">inductively generalizable code that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:52.270" style="s2">true for all people at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.110" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">probabilistically that then gets imposed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.270" end="00:10:57.690" style="s2">but then it all immediately becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:11:00.390" style="s2">impersonal procedural code that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.690" end="00:11:02.850" style="s2">intuitive desire for authentic unique</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.390" end="00:11:05.900" style="s2">relating reacts against so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.850" end="00:11:08.550" style="s2">real it&#39;s an interesting dynamic so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.900" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">this is thank you great that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.550" end="00:11:13.920" style="s2">connection so so two things come up</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:15.900" style="s2">so one is you know I&#39;m engaged in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.920" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">project of trying to figure out what do</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.900" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">logos look like and whatnot electic it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">and your that&#39;s totally relevant to what</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:25.980" style="s2">you just talked about and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:27.900" style="s2">thing is you know that therapy has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.980" end="00:11:29.430" style="s2">transformative component to it not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.900" end="00:11:31.590" style="s2">a representational component and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.430" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">why you need the perspective another</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.590" end="00:11:37.530" style="s2">participatory so that&#39;s coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:39.270" style="s2">then I i I&#39;ve read I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.530" end="00:11:41.460" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about those two points but</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.270" end="00:11:43.650" style="s2">first a brief sort of empirical point</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.460" end="00:11:48.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve read some research show it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.650" end="00:11:51.030" style="s2">two things that independent of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.620" end="00:11:53.010" style="s2">techniques you&#39;re using or approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.030" end="00:11:55.020" style="s2">rapport is the thing that&#39;s the single</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.010" end="00:11:57.480" style="s2">most important predictor of how well</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.020" end="00:11:59.580" style="s2">therapy goes and then I&#39;ve also read</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.480" end="00:12:01.530" style="s2">some meta reviews that saying a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.580" end="00:12:04.170" style="s2">the evidence-based things like CBT are</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.530" end="00:12:07.070" style="s2">now losing their effectiveness across</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.170" end="00:12:09.480" style="s2">time because the older practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.070" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">advocated CBT but they had all this</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.480" end="00:12:13.470" style="s2">implicit respectable and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:16.170" style="s2">stuff and what&#39;s happened is all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.470" end="00:12:18.780" style="s2">been transmitted what there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.170" end="00:12:20.850" style="s2">copying error what it&#39;s being reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.780" end="00:12:22.650" style="s2">the recipe and so these these therapies</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.850" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">are actually losing their effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.650" end="00:12:27.570" style="s2">as we as we move through time and so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.020" end="00:12:28.680" style="s2">thought first of all are you like you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.570" end="00:12:33.450" style="s2">nodding your head so it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:35.940" style="s2">that&#39;s familiar information to you right</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.450" end="00:12:39.570" style="s2">so rapport isn&#39;t exactly the word I</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.940" end="00:12:41.400" style="s2">would use its alliance okay there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.570" end="00:12:43.410" style="s2">technical thing around Alliance and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.400" end="00:12:45.660" style="s2">and the essence of Alliance and really I</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.410" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">run and of course a lot of this is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.660" end="00:12:49.380" style="s2">complicated at the level of language</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:51.030" style="s2">yeah it would meaning our our language</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.380" end="00:12:54.420" style="s2">games and then what is actually just</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.030" end="00:12:56.220" style="s2">circular and and all of that but what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.420" end="00:12:58.170" style="s2">absolutely the case as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.220" end="00:13:01.640" style="s2">concerned is that the psychosocial</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.170" end="00:13:04.950" style="s2">relational process variables okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.640" end="00:13:06.960" style="s2">documented over and over empirically so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:09.000" style="s2">empirically the humanists were basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.960" end="00:13:11.180" style="s2">right in the sense that to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.000" end="00:13:13.940" style="s2">that you establish a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.180" end="00:13:15.590" style="s2">that has good flow okay a shared</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.940" end="00:13:16.940" style="s2">understanding of your trouble and your</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.590" end="00:13:19.280" style="s2">healing and we have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.940" end="00:13:20.780" style="s2">understanding of the tasks you get those</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.280" end="00:13:23.000" style="s2">ingredients together and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.780" end="00:13:27.220" style="s2">associated with good outcome right okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.000" end="00:13:30.530" style="s2">okay okay that&#39;s what I was referring to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.220" end="00:13:31.940" style="s2">general common factors and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.530" end="00:13:34.760" style="s2">really matter if your language game is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:36.890" style="s2">CBT or if it&#39;s a bona fide psychodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.760" end="00:13:38.930" style="s2">or if it&#39;s emotion focused or or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.890" end="00:13:40.430" style="s2">an existential I mean if you do that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.930" end="00:13:42.220" style="s2">then we track people and it has these</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.430" end="00:13:45.110" style="s2">ingredients and then you get basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.220" end="00:13:47.030" style="s2">in the opening chapter of my book in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.110" end="00:13:50.300" style="s2">original book is called from racing</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.030" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">horses to seeing the elephant right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.300" end="00:13:54.680" style="s2">it comes from my history in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">psychotherapy when I came from a CBT</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.680" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">tradition thinking that that was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2">the science so CBT is good and then I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:03.590" style="s2">realized actually that&#39;s basically BS</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:04.910" style="s2">when you get inside of it the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.590" end="00:14:06.470" style="s2">the matter is this is ten times more</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.910" end="00:14:08.870" style="s2">complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.470" end="00:14:11.540" style="s2">and none of the paradigms traditional</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.870" end="00:14:14.600" style="s2">bonafide paradigms win but actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s these processes okay and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.600" end="00:14:18.740" style="s2">convinced in fact you were your</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:20.540" style="s2">knowledge system just gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.740" end="00:14:22.070" style="s2">language as to why I was convinced I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.540" end="00:14:24.770" style="s2">always convinced that we didn&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.070" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">scientific humanistic dialectics and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.770" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">dynamic right you know we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.670" style="s2">the right language in fact that program</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">I directed on the part of still but that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.670" end="00:14:37.780" style="s2">I director for 12 years was explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:40.760" style="s2">scientific humanistic in his orientation</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.780" end="00:14:42.680" style="s2">and that is we would draw on scientific</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.760" end="00:14:44.150" style="s2">language concepts and principles we</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.680" end="00:14:46.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be talking about God and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.150" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">praying to God as psychologists but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.520" end="00:14:52.250" style="s2">would be talking about a language of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:53.900" style="s2">science terms and then impute that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.250" end="00:14:56.290" style="s2">look at the research evidence and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.900" end="00:14:59.330" style="s2">put it in a unique IDEO graphic</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.290" end="00:15:02.210" style="s2">participatory relation right right</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.330" end="00:15:04.630" style="s2">excellent right and and that and that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.210" end="00:15:05.900" style="s2">and that making sure you have the space</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.630" end="00:15:07.490" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.900" end="00:15:08.930" style="s2">you know like because I would always</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.490" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">take okay so you&#39;re gonna read the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.930" end="00:15:12.920" style="s2">literature and say CBT is good for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">and then I walk into your office because</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.920" end="00:15:16.430" style="s2">I have problems I spent four years with</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:17.530" style="s2">Beck right and you&#39;re gonna what are you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:21.230" style="s2">gonna do start walking me through</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.530" end="00:15:22.370" style="s2">automatic thoughts and you know I really</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.759" end="00:15:32.540" style="s2">have to have the skills to participate</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.170" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">to do that and and that and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.540" end="00:15:38.870" style="s2">unique and dynamic video graphic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.190" style="s2">got all of these elements okay can we</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.870" end="00:15:41.720" style="s2">zoom in on this right now because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.190" end="00:15:43.430" style="s2">think that&#39;s absolutely because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.720" end="00:15:44.810" style="s2">the pit that&#39;s the point because now</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.430" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">this is where it overlaps with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.810" end="00:15:49.819" style="s2">broader concern I have about you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:52.040" style="s2">getting the logos back breaking</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.819" end="00:15:53.930" style="s2">monologic presentation of information</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.040" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">and bringing back the logos which</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.930" end="00:15:58.790" style="s2">introduces aporia and challenges just to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:15:59.959" style="s2">aspiration and transformation because</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.790" end="00:16:03.529" style="s2">you&#39;re obviously referencing those</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.959" end="00:16:04.730" style="s2">processes within therapy but I know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.529" end="00:16:06.470" style="s2">might have seen some of the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.730" end="00:16:09.079" style="s2">I&#39;m having with people like guy sends</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.470" end="00:16:11.149" style="s2">talked and I encircling practice where</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.079" end="00:16:13.940" style="s2">people are trying to like take this up</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.149" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">to take this back up and and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.940" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">back into no no we got to adjust the</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.370" end="00:16:24.019" style="s2">psychotherapeutic concerns we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.800" end="00:16:26.509" style="s2">shared cultural existential concerns</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.019" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">that need to be addressed so if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.509" end="00:16:31.310" style="s2">allow me and and and then you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.390" end="00:19:08.510" style="s2">self-knowledge because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.770" end="00:19:10.399" style="s2">were just talking about there and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.510" end="00:19:12.409" style="s2">said it you you said it&#39;s not just your</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.399" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">beliefs or your image there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.409" end="00:19:16.789" style="s2">more to that because you then said it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">allows you to it goes back to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.789" end="00:19:20.390" style="s2">mutual shaping I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:22.010" style="s2">earlier it allows you to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.390" end="00:19:25.880" style="s2">mutual shaping with your with your</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.010" end="00:19:27.320" style="s2">client I take it so I&#39;m sorry I I hope</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.880" end="00:19:29.659" style="s2">you&#39;re not frustrate I want to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.320" end="00:19:33.020" style="s2">and what&#39;s this self not what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.659" end="00:19:34.730" style="s2">self knowing right right is this okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.020" end="00:19:37.399" style="s2">with you what I&#39;m doing the course yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.730" end="00:19:39.559" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely so I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.399" end="00:19:40.820" style="s2">in our world certainly a lot of that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.559" end="00:19:43.909" style="s2">that well why do we really encourage</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.820" end="00:19:46.039" style="s2">people to go to therapy right why why in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.909" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">our supervision do we you know as</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.039" end="00:19:50.440" style="s2">supervisors notice when people get</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">anxious notice when people you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.440" end="00:19:54.250" style="s2">avoid certain topics notice people have</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:57.700" style="s2">certain kinds of tics and why do we make</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.250" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">that in a in a tactful way but in also</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.700" end="00:20:02.740" style="s2">in a direct way why do we make that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:04.570" style="s2">conscious mmm I know because you got a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.740" end="00:20:07.000" style="s2">deal with your shadow the thing you did</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.570" end="00:20:10.680" style="s2">with Anderson Todd you know that I was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.000" end="00:20:13.780" style="s2">wonderful in there if I get that name</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.680" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">perfect so he is narrative at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.780" end="00:20:17.500" style="s2">that where he hates that guy you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:20.260" style="s2">that talkative know-it-all guy which by</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.500" end="00:20:22.600" style="s2">the way this is a particular narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.260" end="00:20:25.750" style="s2">that I could relate to okay and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.600" end="00:20:27.460" style="s2">split it off okay because I yes I talk a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.750" end="00:20:30.040" style="s2">lot no I&#39;m not an arrogant know-it-all</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.460" end="00:20:33.220" style="s2">got right but that guy is I know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.040" end="00:20:35.310" style="s2">right so that was a wonderful moment in</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.220" end="00:20:37.720" style="s2">which our tendency to justify</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.310" end="00:20:39.340" style="s2">consciously splits us off from some</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.720" end="00:20:41.950" style="s2">aspects of ourselves so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.340" end="00:20:43.390" style="s2">conscious relative to who we are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.950" end="00:20:47.200" style="s2">also all the stuff that we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.390" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">well I&#39;m a white guy you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.200" end="00:20:49.900" style="s2">in a middle age that comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">particular background well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.900" end="00:20:53.020" style="s2">salience factor of that if all of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:55.780" style="s2">sudden I sit down with somebody from</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.020" end="00:20:57.640" style="s2">India you know or whatever of course so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.780" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s that kind of those are</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.640" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">propositional elements and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:03.340" style="s2">just a lot of immersion right you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.960" end="00:21:04.450" style="s2">like you were talking about like Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.340" end="00:21:06.550" style="s2">I think you know it&#39;s just sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.450" end="00:21:08.860" style="s2">you know you got to get in there and do</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.550" end="00:21:13.150" style="s2">it and get some feedback and create that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.860" end="00:21:15.070" style="s2">immediate you know feedback flow so so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.150" end="00:21:18.310" style="s2">there&#39;s that and let me also say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.070" end="00:21:20.950" style="s2">in the unified framework okay the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.310" end="00:21:24.430" style="s2">unified framework argues that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.950" end="00:21:26.710" style="s2">relation of pre propositional relational</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.430" end="00:21:28.150" style="s2">system of adaptation well that I map</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.710" end="00:21:31.720" style="s2">through what&#39;s called the influence</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.150" end="00:21:35.070" style="s2">matrix okay and that influence matrix is</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.720" end="00:21:38.770" style="s2">the way we create intuitive self other</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.070" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">representational spaces right and place</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.770" end="00:21:44.290" style="s2">ourselves on vertical axes of power you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:47.020" style="s2">know briefly horizontal reactions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.290" end="00:21:49.180" style="s2">affiliation autonomy axes of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.020" end="00:21:50.890" style="s2">and we&#39;re constantly fine-tuning those</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.180" end="00:21:53.110" style="s2">kinds of things and we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.890" end="00:21:55.420" style="s2">then having an intuitive sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.110" end="00:21:57.430" style="s2">ourself in relation okay so when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.420" end="00:21:58.450" style="s2">were saying is this okay is this okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.430" end="00:22:00.370" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.450" end="00:22:02.410" style="s2">you were intuitively checking oh gosh am</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.370" end="00:22:04.060" style="s2">i dominating am i pushing this I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.410" end="00:22:06.870" style="s2">make sure we&#39;re gonna do right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.060" end="00:22:08.680" style="s2">exactly thank you that&#39;s that was good I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.870" end="00:22:09.910" style="s2">one of the things I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.680" end="00:22:12.430" style="s2">important I&#39;ve been talking to guy about</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.910" end="00:22:14.590" style="s2">this is the degree to which in genuine</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.430" end="00:22:16.750" style="s2">dia logos you can move between</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.590" end="00:22:19.450" style="s2">explication and then pointing to how the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.750" end="00:22:20.620" style="s2">dialogue itself is exemplifying a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.450" end="00:22:22.660" style="s2">the stuff you want to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.620" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">so you&#39;re constantly moving back between</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.660" end="00:22:28.540" style="s2">sort of theory in theory a-- so i so let</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.420" style="s2">me let me sort of this is what i heard</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:32.920" style="s2">you saying i heard you saying no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.420" end="00:22:34.390" style="s2">not talking about sort of people&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.920" end="00:22:36.700" style="s2">know just their sort of standard sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.390" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">autobiography or you know the beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.700" end="00:22:39.550" style="s2">they have about you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:41.260" style="s2">discarding that but that&#39;s massively</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.550" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">insufficient what you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.260" end="00:22:45.340" style="s2">at is you&#39;re trying to get out how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">process the the ongoing continual</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.340" end="00:22:49.450" style="s2">dynamic process of how they&#39;re assuming</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:52.660" style="s2">an identity and assigning identities to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.450" end="00:22:55.210" style="s2">things is actually skewing their their</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.660" end="00:22:57.310" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s it&#39;s the lens through</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.210" end="00:22:58.360" style="s2">which and it&#39;s a two-way lens it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.310" end="00:23:00.190" style="s2">lens through which they&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.360" end="00:23:02.110" style="s2">world and themselves and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.190" end="00:23:05.920" style="s2">to get them if you&#39;ll allow me to sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.110" end="00:23:07.480" style="s2">of do this right no no yes and become</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.920" end="00:23:09.370" style="s2">aware of that become aware of how the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.480" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">identification the co identification</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.370" end="00:23:13.510" style="s2">process and the salience Landscaping are</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:15.670" style="s2">deeply interpenetrating and bound</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.510" end="00:23:17.980" style="s2">together and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a profound</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.670" end="00:23:19.690" style="s2">kind of well that&#39;s that I could see</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.980" end="00:23:20.830" style="s2">that or I could see why first of all two</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.690" end="00:23:24.130" style="s2">things I can see why that really</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.830" end="00:23:26.680" style="s2">requires you know you you be in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.130" end="00:23:28.120" style="s2">or you know practice you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.680" end="00:23:31.510" style="s2">undergone therapy is that the right word</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.120" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">in order to practice therapy sure that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.510" end="00:23:35.920" style="s2">brings me to the the point that because</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:37.930" style="s2">this sounds like a very and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.920" end="00:23:39.880" style="s2">again deeply Socratic this is a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.930" end="00:23:42.040" style="s2">threatening thing to do I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.880" end="00:23:45.910" style="s2">this kind of self knowing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.040" end="00:23:47.140" style="s2">talking about yes yes because it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.910" end="00:23:50.110" style="s2">again I&#39;ll put it in the language of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.140" end="00:23:53.290" style="s2">unified theory as to why it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.110" end="00:23:57.190" style="s2">essentially that shapes the human eye</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.290" end="00:23:59.020" style="s2">this who I as an I am is a is a mental</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.190" end="00:24:00.940" style="s2">organ of justification in other words</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.020" end="00:24:03.820" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally sits to give an</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.940" end="00:24:06.520" style="s2">account of the self in this social field</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.820" end="00:24:09.070" style="s2">that legitimizes some aspect of it right</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.520" end="00:24:11.860" style="s2">by definition that also creates a shadow</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.070" end="00:24:12.760" style="s2">of what is not legitimate generally</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.860" end="00:24:14.530" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.760" end="00:24:16.570" style="s2">and so what&#39;s threatening is that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.530" end="00:24:18.090" style="s2">system will have consistency it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.570" end="00:24:20.130" style="s2">have it certain biases</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.090" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">confirmation biases and tendencies and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.130" end="00:24:24.210" style="s2">that will create a cognitive stability</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:26.100" style="s2">that if you challenge will get cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.210" end="00:24:28.860" style="s2">dissonance right and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.100" end="00:24:31.860" style="s2">anxiety and psychodynamic defense that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.860" end="00:24:34.440" style="s2">tries to re-stabilize and split off and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.860" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">so it&#39;s very hard to have the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.440" end="00:24:38.940" style="s2">enter into that space and to open</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:41.490" style="s2">oneself up and say oh my god maybe I am</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.940" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">kind of an arrogant person or maybe I am</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.490" end="00:24:45.419" style="s2">really insecure about this and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.890" style="s2">compensate through that and now all of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.419" end="00:24:49.260" style="s2">sudden as I encounter that it&#39;s like uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.890" end="00:24:51.330" style="s2">but if you&#39;re held as you encounter it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.260" end="00:24:53.460" style="s2">you can then include and transcend it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.330" end="00:24:55.020" style="s2">rather than split it off this is</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.779" end="00:31:38.980" style="s2">non-judgmental accepting way of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.330" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">person the situation they&#39;re in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.980" end="00:31:44.470" style="s2">problem possibilities it&#39;s basically so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:46.299" style="s2">then if we have a sense as where what</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.470" end="00:31:47.950" style="s2">does that look like that environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.299" end="00:31:50.350" style="s2">well then can you create that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.950" end="00:31:53.320" style="s2">prospectively in your head can you open</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.350" end="00:31:55.690" style="s2">up a space where you see yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.320" end="00:31:57.789" style="s2">this way step outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.690" end="00:32:01.179" style="s2">subjectivity and become the object of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.789" end="00:32:03.299" style="s2">your attention and that&#39;s a mo that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.179" end="00:32:06.610" style="s2">your metacognitive observer</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.299" end="00:32:08.620" style="s2">so that&#39;s calm mo of calm what now are</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.610" end="00:32:10.299" style="s2">in calm mind and what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.620" end="00:32:12.610" style="s2">is cultivate a better cognitive observer</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.299" end="00:32:14.679" style="s2">that can step outside the flow where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.610" end="00:32:17.860" style="s2">flow becomes the object of our attention</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.679" end="00:32:19.990" style="s2">right okay so it&#39;s a meta move outside</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.860" end="00:32:22.210" style="s2">of the stream so and so the stream</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.990" end="00:32:25.419" style="s2">becomes an observer Segel has the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.210" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">that mindfulness is in fact an ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.419" end="00:32:29.980" style="s2">to internalize mindsight resonance yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.390" style="s2">well that would be very very good system</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.980" end="00:32:33.130" style="s2">with that okay and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.390" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">well how do you achieve resonance what</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.130" end="00:32:37.210" style="s2">is the and this gets into then and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:38.860" style="s2">like Siegel by the way is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.210" end="00:32:40.980" style="s2">interesting an interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.860" end="00:32:43.450" style="s2">neurobiology is a great integrative</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.980" end="00:32:57.159" style="s2">frame of reference okay that cuts across</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.450" end="00:32:59.230" style="s2">a wide variety so now son yes but now we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.159" end="00:33:01.779" style="s2">want to create resonance well what is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.230" end="00:33:04.210" style="s2">what what are the attitudinal signals</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.779" end="00:33:07.510" style="s2">and and frames that we want to offer to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.210" end="00:33:09.940" style="s2">do that okay and calm is an acronym that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.510" end="00:33:11.559" style="s2">gives you the attitudinal frames of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.940" end="00:33:13.750" style="s2">reference and it starts with the word</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.559" end="00:33:15.670" style="s2">curiosity right</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.750" end="00:33:18.490" style="s2">so Curie so we want an open and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.670" end="00:33:20.950" style="s2">wandering mind that ask questions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.490" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">explores okay rather than one that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.950" end="00:33:28.060" style="s2">closes down and a certain lose and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:30.400" style="s2">closure you know they&#39;re Zeke&#39;s closure</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.060" end="00:33:32.140" style="s2">right there&#39;s all this emerging work on</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.400" end="00:33:33.520" style="s2">people who prematurely seek cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.140" end="00:33:36.040" style="s2">closure that&#39;s right they want an</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:37.270" style="s2">answers they know what to do right they</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.040" end="00:33:40.360" style="s2">do they need to make sense out of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.270" end="00:33:42.940" style="s2">quickly is a state of anxiety and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.360" end="00:33:44.860" style="s2">you know and we and so then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.940" end="00:33:46.630" style="s2">there&#39;s that and each one of these you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.860" end="00:33:48.610" style="s2">can put them on a continuum so you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.630" end="00:33:51.310" style="s2">you know curiosity can go to its</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.610" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">opposite okay then the next one is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.310" end="00:33:56.560" style="s2">acceptance okay so call the a and kamas</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:58.890" style="s2">acceptance and this this ranges anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.560" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">from Buddhist notions to add attachment</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.890" end="00:34:05.350" style="s2">to dialectical behavior therapy of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:07.960" style="s2">distress tolerance the capacity to hold</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.350" end="00:34:11.650" style="s2">one&#39;s experience and say it is what it</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.960" end="00:34:16.150" style="s2">is the capacity to be and ideally be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.650" end="00:34:19.090" style="s2">okay in a Buddha mind okay so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.150" end="00:34:21.220" style="s2">second the L is loving compassion okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.090" end="00:34:22.420" style="s2">this is holding people with dignity and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.220" end="00:34:24.820" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.420" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">wishing they didn&#39;t suffer and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.820" end="00:34:31.030" style="s2">very much is true for me as soon as to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:33.850" style="s2">you in creating a meta M et ta the frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.030" end="00:34:36.730" style="s2">of mind an Eastern way and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.850" end="00:34:39.340" style="s2">M am stance am motivated toward valued</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.730" end="00:34:42.550" style="s2">states of being in the short and long</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.340" end="00:34:44.350" style="s2">term mmm so in the short term is like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.550" end="00:34:47.170" style="s2">okay I&#39;m in the proximal situation what</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.350" end="00:34:48.550" style="s2">do I want out of this hour okay and if I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.170" end="00:34:50.080" style="s2">get into a fight with somebody how do I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.550" end="00:34:52.090" style="s2">want it to end as I walk out the door</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.080" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">that&#39;s short term and then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.090" end="00:34:58.840" style="s2">the long term okay the who do across all</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:00.610" style="s2">the way up to what some people in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.840" end="00:35:02.650" style="s2">called act is a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.610" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">therapy they also use the exercise of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.650" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">eulogy values okay so what what do you</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:14.500" style="s2">that would connect to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.670" end="00:35:17.080" style="s2">divine double image we&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.500" end="00:35:19.060" style="s2">aspirational yes exactly when I create</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.080" end="00:35:20.890" style="s2">an image of what it is we could be and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.060" end="00:35:23.260" style="s2">then utilize that for relevance</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.890" end="00:35:25.120" style="s2">realization down line in the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.260" end="00:35:25.810" style="s2">sense of image in the imaginal sense not</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.120" end="00:35:26.220" style="s2">imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.810" end="00:35:29.220" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.220" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">exactly and so that we can see and know</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.220" end="00:35:34.200" style="s2">and make and create it through this</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:37.109" style="s2">particular kind of working symbol right</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.200" end="00:35:41.160" style="s2">and then it becomes co-creative you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.109" end="00:35:44.099" style="s2">that&#39;s the beauty oh so so do you do a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.160" end="00:35:45.930" style="s2">lot of like I mean I&#39;ve as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.099" end="00:35:47.400" style="s2">teach people the past now I teach them</p>

<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:52.109" style="s2">you spend a lot of time when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.580" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">trying to move people into this deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.109" end="00:35:56.700" style="s2">level of confidence are you doing lots</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:59.310" style="s2">of just exercise practice with comment</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.700" end="00:36:01.140" style="s2">comment oh exercises is that if you do a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.310" end="00:36:03.810" style="s2">lot of that kind of thing yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.140" end="00:36:06.780" style="s2">it&#39;s you you sort of hand people this</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.810" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">outline okay and certainly in the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.780" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">of psychotherapy and depending on where</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:13.320" style="s2">they are they then bring it back each</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:16.109" style="s2">week and and we sort of go through his</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.320" end="00:36:18.300" style="s2">own a proximal development right what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.109" end="00:36:20.310" style="s2">have not done what is it what is in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.300" end="00:36:23.010" style="s2">works right now I mean this is now just</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.310" end="00:36:25.859" style="s2">a psycho technology that I&#39;m sharing and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.010" end="00:36:27.540" style="s2">inside the program that I operate you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.859" end="00:36:29.880" style="s2">know everyone knows what calm mo is and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.540" end="00:36:32.630" style="s2">it&#39;s useful okay it has not been turned</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.880" end="00:36:36.450" style="s2">into a product you know that&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.630" end="00:36:38.670" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean that negatively I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.450" end="00:36:42.660" style="s2">it really I see this as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.670" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">could be really useful I do hate I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.660" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">always had an issue with sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.849" style="s2">you know try to create recipes but this</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:50.820" style="s2">really is the kind of this is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.849" end="00:36:53.310" style="s2">of psycho technology that I find does is</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.820" end="00:36:55.380" style="s2">justice to both enough of the principles</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.310" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s complete enough and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.380" end="00:36:58.970" style="s2">dynamic enough and fosters the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:01.170" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.970" end="00:37:04.920" style="s2">elements that does it and it doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.170" end="00:37:06.420" style="s2">corrupted by that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.920" end="00:37:08.550" style="s2">do is how do you create these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.420" end="00:37:11.339" style="s2">that don&#39;t then just become algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.550" end="00:37:12.900" style="s2">like CBT right that then get corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.339" end="00:37:14.730" style="s2">and then turn people into little</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.900" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">cultural code robots if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.730" end="00:37:18.089" style="s2">successful which of course is really</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">what we don&#39;t want to do you know we</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.089" end="00:37:20.760" style="s2">don&#39;t really want all right what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:30.089" style="s2">key to happiness oh well these are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.760" end="00:37:32.330" style="s2">fourth step so now you&#39;re done so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.089" end="00:37:35.580" style="s2">really cool</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.330" end="00:37:36.660" style="s2">know what I mean I mean the idea as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.580" end="00:37:38.040" style="s2">whole school but what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.660" end="00:37:39.720" style="s2">there at that last moment though the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.040" end="00:37:42.060" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.720" end="00:37:43.740" style="s2">like so almost like you always you want</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.060" end="00:37:45.359" style="s2">to always be sort of zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:48.390" style="s2">development you want to give enough so</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.359" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">that people right get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.390" end="00:37:50.910" style="s2">you&#39;re doing but you don&#39;t want it you</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:52.410" style="s2">don&#39;t want it as you say you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.910" end="00:37:54.540" style="s2">to make it an algorithm they always have</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.410" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">to sort of tap into right the</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.050" end="00:38:49.890" style="s2">know my basic definition of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.730" end="00:38:52.260" style="s2">is a science of mental behavior okay so</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.890" end="00:39:00.450" style="s2">mind movement and mental behavior I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.260" end="00:39:05.160" style="s2">all excited anyway but but yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.450" end="00:39:06.930" style="s2">this challenge okay to create this to</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.830" end="00:39:24.330" style="s2">there is no science of Greg Henriques</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.900" end="00:39:26.220" style="s2">right you know because I&#39;m the unique</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.300" end="00:39:35.910" style="s2">of Greg and Rica&#39;s right but there could</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.500" end="00:39:53.730" style="s2">this regard so anyway that&#39;s use that so</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.410" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">it is that dialectic always</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.980" end="00:40:05.850" style="s2">no no I think that&#39;s really valuable I</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.660" end="00:40:08.369" style="s2">mean that that is so consonant with with</p>

<p begin="00:40:59.510" end="00:41:03.240" style="s2">thought what you just said there was</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.410" end="00:41:04.470" style="s2">deeply converging with her argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.240" end="00:41:06.869" style="s2">because she was also saying you know</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">the inductive generalization the the</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.290" end="00:41:45.380" style="s2">capture that in there in the dialog in</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.330" end="00:41:49.350" style="s2">my own work between cognitive science of</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.350" end="00:41:53.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the humanistic and the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.910" end="00:41:55.350" style="s2">I mean the we wrote about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.580" end="00:41:58.830" style="s2">eleventh you know important to I use</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.350" end="00:42:00.900" style="s2">your thing to look at myself and my tree</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.830" end="00:42:03.240" style="s2">of knowledge inside you know the flat</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.240" end="00:42:06.270" style="s2">sudden it drew it out and I still to</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.369" end="00:42:11.510" style="s2">and it was this unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:14.069" style="s2">intersection between my unique</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.510" end="00:42:16.770" style="s2">particular knowledge and my sati ila</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.069" end="00:42:18.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like I remember this stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.770" end="00:42:21.480" style="s2">it was like it was there all along it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.780" end="00:42:24.089" style="s2">was this very very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.480" end="00:42:27.630" style="s2">experience along those lines so really</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.089" end="00:42:29.369" style="s2">really cool well yeah yeah thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.630" end="00:42:31.980" style="s2">sharing about that I thought I thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.369" end="00:42:34.049" style="s2">in addition to its theoretical import I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.980" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">thought it was a nice rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.049" end="00:42:38.790" style="s2">flourish I mean that as a compliment</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:40.799" style="s2">because when you brought in that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.790" end="00:42:43.410" style="s2">personal story I think that gives people</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.799" end="00:42:44.670" style="s2">a much more concrete and accessible</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.410" end="00:42:46.980" style="s2">understanding of the kind of stuff they</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.670" end="00:42:49.619" style="s2">were talking about right well I and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.980" end="00:42:51.660" style="s2">think that&#39;s an and go to nod to your</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.619" end="00:42:54.690" style="s2">point about participatory you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.660" end="00:42:56.510" style="s2">mean you know why that&#39;s how we embody</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.690" end="00:42:58.770" style="s2">stuff right I mean why the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.510" end="00:43:01.349" style="s2">advertisements for getting money to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.770" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">Africa you know when they list three</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.349" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">million children you know propositional</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:08.339" style="s2">e you get one thing when you see one</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:10.380" style="s2">child right and then all the money flows</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.339" end="00:43:12.599" style="s2">in and and the reason is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.380" end="00:43:14.819" style="s2">a there&#39;s a participatory perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.599" end="00:43:18.470" style="s2">connection to that that&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.819" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">you know and so it&#39;s that juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.470" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:26.430" style="s2">than between these two things so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.190" style="s2">remember I was talking about earlier how</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.430" end="00:43:30.869" style="s2">there&#39;s this movement in genuine</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.190" end="00:43:33.079" style="s2">dialogue between sort of explication of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.869" end="00:43:34.859" style="s2">an idea and then turning back</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.079" end="00:43:36.540" style="s2">recursively and saying how is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.859" end="00:43:39.059" style="s2">exemplified in what we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.540" end="00:43:40.799" style="s2">here now it&#39;s not moving between theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.059" end="00:43:42.990" style="s2">and theory you&#39;re constantly doing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.799" end="00:43:44.700" style="s2">and that seems to be a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.990" end="00:43:45.450" style="s2">we&#39;re tapping into this point that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.700" end="00:43:47.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve just made</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.450" end="00:43:51.319" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly also trying to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.910" end="00:43:53.880" style="s2">dialogue going between the soul and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.319" end="00:43:57.299" style="s2">best knowledge we have of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.880" end="00:43:58.920" style="s2">of illa-llah that&#39;s what I mean when I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.299" end="00:44:02.130" style="s2">talk about scientific humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.920" end="00:44:05.400" style="s2">dialectic that&#39;s very very much alone</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.130" end="00:44:07.260" style="s2">and I see good and see what what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.160" end="00:45:02.140" style="s2">get at is take something like circling</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.470" end="00:45:04.870" style="s2">which is about setting up this alliance</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.140" end="00:45:07.290" style="s2">and getting the flow going right in</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.870" end="00:45:10.090" style="s2">collective intelligence but then</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.950" end="00:45:17.170" style="s2">about here so that it&#39;s the circle is</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.260" end="00:45:19.330" style="s2">not always just about circling and where</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.170" end="00:45:21.540" style="s2">people are in their lives but you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.330" end="00:45:24.990" style="s2">get the circle to circle around</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.540" end="00:45:27.130" style="s2">circumambulate topics like yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.990" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">meeting making that we&#39;re not only</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.130" end="00:45:31.300" style="s2">talking about but exemplifying in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:33.820" style="s2">dialogue and we could move between</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.300" end="00:45:36.220" style="s2">explication and exemplification we could</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.820" end="00:45:38.500" style="s2">move between how we internalize it in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.220" end="00:45:40.930" style="s2">our soul and how we try to fit it into</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.500" end="00:45:42.850" style="s2">our best science of human beings that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.930" end="00:45:46.870" style="s2">what I want guy sometimes calls this</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.850" end="00:45:48.610" style="s2">circling 2.0 that&#39;s what so that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.870" end="00:45:50.050" style="s2">that&#39;s unbelievably because then what</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.610" end="00:45:51.400" style="s2">you&#39;re basically doing for my management</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.050" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">office see if I can put it in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.400" end="00:45:55.180" style="s2">language you know is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:58.300" style="s2">intersection of the four p&#39;s embodied</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.180" end="00:46:01.350" style="s2">yes yes very much very very much totally</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.300" end="00:46:03.790" style="s2">embodied enacted and enacted in a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.350" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">right that&#39;s open to what we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.790" end="00:46:07.050" style="s2">talking about before that it there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:09.640" style="s2">emergence ability to it it can it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.050" end="00:46:11.740" style="s2">transcend itself as a process it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.640" end="00:46:13.630" style="s2">my founded it can&#39;t be turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.740" end="00:46:15.670" style="s2">recipe and an algorithm because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.630" end="00:46:17.410" style="s2">there&#39;s an ongoing constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.670" end="00:46:19.570" style="s2">recognition that its ability to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.410" end="00:46:21.910" style="s2">transcend itself an emergence is what</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.570" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">this is ultimately all about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.910" end="00:46:24.670" style="s2">right that&#39;s right and we can follow a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:32.050" style="s2">line all the way up to relevance</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.670" end="00:46:34.090" style="s2">realization and that I mean to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.050" end="00:46:36.060" style="s2">I&#39;m working with a southern a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.090" end="00:46:39.190" style="s2">friend of mine Michaelmas Colo a</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.060" end="00:46:42.580" style="s2">sophisticated developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.190" end="00:46:44.710" style="s2">and he you know talks about creating the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.580" end="00:46:47.320" style="s2">good society and how we need to build</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.710" end="00:46:50.140" style="s2">bridges okay and what it fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.320" end="00:46:52.030" style="s2">it is is no he likes the kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.140" end="00:46:53.710" style="s2">the fear for self in other words I got</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.030" end="00:46:55.690" style="s2">to protect myself and the love for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.710" end="00:46:58.210" style="s2">other and how do we hold that in</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.690" end="00:47:00.040" style="s2">particular ways and then how do we do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.210" end="00:47:02.110" style="s2">so that we understand where the divide</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.040" end="00:47:04.990" style="s2">is and then how do we bridge the divide</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.110" end="00:47:07.330" style="s2">to create common ground okay that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.990" end="00:47:08.710" style="s2">grounds us you know and what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.330" end="00:47:10.290" style="s2">from the tree of knowledge perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.710" end="00:47:12.820" style="s2">is we want to ground ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.290" end="00:47:15.210" style="s2">propositional e in good justification</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.820" end="00:47:18.100" style="s2">systems and we want to ground ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.210" end="00:47:20.080" style="s2">relationally in in manifesting what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.100" end="00:47:22.210" style="s2">call relational value that&#39;s being known</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.080" end="00:47:24.940" style="s2">and valued by important others right</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.210" end="00:47:26.890" style="s2">right we create that relational feel the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.940" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">just of get or II feel as we engage in</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.890" end="00:47:30.340" style="s2">these kinds of endeavors then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:33.190" style="s2">actually are creating the common ground</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.340" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">through and through through the four P</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.190" end="00:47:40.540" style="s2">level you know and that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">system that was a very nice piece of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.540" end="00:47:43.810" style="s2">integration you just did thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">that that was very good I like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.810" end="00:47:52.360" style="s2">um so once once you get people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:53.560" style="s2">you know getting a kind of expertise if</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.360" end="00:47:56.620" style="s2">they even that&#39;s the right word with</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.560" end="00:47:58.720" style="s2">calm mo what&#39;s next I mean where I I</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.620" end="00:48:00.460" style="s2">keep turning back to the pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:01.900" style="s2">program that you&#39;re taking people</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.460" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">through cuz I really trying and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.900" end="00:48:06.250" style="s2">this is this is turn I so what I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:08.050" style="s2">hoping for has come to fruition this has</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.250" end="00:48:10.780" style="s2">turned out to be such a rich place to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.050" end="00:48:13.930" style="s2">zoom in and try and you know unpack it</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.780" end="00:48:16.270" style="s2">very carefully so is that a culminating</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.930" end="00:48:18.580" style="s2">thing or what what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.270" end="00:48:20.620" style="s2">yeah I mean you know I&#39;m very much</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.580" end="00:48:28.420" style="s2">involved well I&#39;m involved in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.620" end="00:48:30.730" style="s2">different and so I got a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.420" end="00:48:32.650" style="s2">but so actually you&#39;re right the unified</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.730" end="00:48:36.490" style="s2">framework has three different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.650" end="00:48:38.920" style="s2">really pieces okay one is a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.490" end="00:48:41.650" style="s2">knowledge and wisdom writ large okay so</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.920" end="00:48:44.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a medicine thetic med of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.650" end="00:48:45.369" style="s2">new way of thinking about cyfle Asif II</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.530" end="00:48:47.769" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.369" end="00:48:50.039" style="s2">to launch an Enlightenment 2.0 kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.769" end="00:48:50.039" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.140" end="00:48:55.509" style="s2">I was I was telling my wife last night</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.079" end="00:48:57.130" style="s2">because I had heard the mind and motion</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.509" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">kind of thing I was like yes we need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.130" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">take Newton&#39;s matter in motion and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:04.569" style="s2">need to add a Concilium mind in motion</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:07.479" style="s2">so there&#39;s that and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.569" end="00:49:09.219" style="s2">unit is this really unified theory of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.479" end="00:49:11.309" style="s2">psychology which then hones in on</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.219" end="00:49:14.519" style="s2">cognitive science and all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.309" end="00:49:18.130" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the unified approach</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.519" end="00:49:20.049" style="s2">which is at the doctoral level ok how</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.130" end="00:49:22.930" style="s2">would a doctoral level psychologist be</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.049" end="00:49:25.329" style="s2">an applied professional ok and not learn</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.930" end="00:49:28.029" style="s2">how to be in relation to the socio</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.329" end="00:49:29.859" style="s2">emotional problems that people have and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.029" end="00:49:32.200" style="s2">then how to extract all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.859" end="00:49:34.359" style="s2">out into psycho technologies that then</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.200" end="00:49:36.910" style="s2">can be shared ok so you don&#39;t to be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.359" end="00:49:39.249" style="s2">doctor alone psychology ok and and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.910" end="00:49:42.579" style="s2">what calm mo out is is a really a</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.249" end="00:49:45.400" style="s2">distillation of the applied principles</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.579" end="00:49:48.339" style="s2">that can organize so see emotional</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.400" end="00:49:51.880" style="s2">process especially when people get</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.339" end="00:49:55.900" style="s2">bumped by you know defense and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.880" end="00:50:00.630" style="s2">activation and trouble and shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.900" end="00:50:00.630" style="s2">conflict and then activate calm mo and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.749" end="00:50:04.569" style="s2">ok well I&#39;m gonna have to start bringing</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.650" end="00:50:07.029" style="s2">this towards closure but I would like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.569" end="00:50:11.589" style="s2">want to invite you to have another one</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.029" end="00:50:12.999" style="s2">of these discussions with me why yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.589" end="00:50:16.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of fun and I found this</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.999" end="00:50:18.130" style="s2">tremendously fruitful so I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.180" end="00:50:19.450" style="s2">given me you&#39;ve written me some topics</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.130" end="00:50:22.029" style="s2">and we can pick those up but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.450" end="00:50:24.309" style="s2">general theme that we sort of background</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.029" end="00:50:25.630" style="s2">it behind this that maybe we could fall</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.309" end="00:50:28.210" style="s2">ground the next time we talk which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.630" end="00:50:30.969" style="s2">and it you know and you alluded to it</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.210" end="00:50:33.339" style="s2">explicitly a few times which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.969" end="00:50:36.609" style="s2">this idea about what&#39;s the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.339" end="00:50:39.309" style="s2">between science and spirituality for us</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.609" end="00:50:40.779" style="s2">here now what does that mean not just</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.309" end="00:50:42.130" style="s2">theoretically but the way we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.779" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">talking in a way that gets a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.130" end="00:50:46.900" style="s2">transformative purchase on our lives so</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:48.369" style="s2">that people can engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.900" end="00:50:51.279" style="s2">transformations the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.369" end="00:50:53.140" style="s2">wisdom etc that is needed to address</p>
