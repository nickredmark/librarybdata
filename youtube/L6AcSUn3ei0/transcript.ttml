<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:15.450" style="s2">days on your very interesting Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">stream the first is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">development the website defeat disinfo</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">org has sprung up and frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">predicted something like this back in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">2012 you know tell us about what defeat</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">this info org is and what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">the implications are well it&#39;s built on</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:38.060" style="s2">the same kind of software that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">developed to run counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.060" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">efforts against terrorists groups there</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">were a lot of efforts undertaken over</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">the last decade or so particularly you</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">know in response to Isis trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">know run counter narrative and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">that there&#39;s lots of companies involved</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">in that - I mean there&#39;s a Google wing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">more sub venture that that that focuses</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">on that it&#39;s basically a kind of system</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">that when it sees a narrative develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:13.340" style="s2">that could you know promote a terrorist</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">it would then counter that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:20.330" style="s2">quickly and you know spread that in from</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:23.030" style="s2">you know the counter narrative out to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.330" end="00:02:25.819" style="s2">lot of influencers and in this case</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:30.530" style="s2">defeat disinfo is is focused on</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.819" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">Republicans and Trump so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.530" end="00:02:38.270" style="s2">Trump says something like why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">take disinfectant internally they would</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.270" end="00:02:43.069" style="s2">run a counter narrative and then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:46.010" style="s2">know spread out the the information or</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.069" end="00:02:47.630" style="s2">that the pandemic is similar to the flu</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.010" end="00:02:50.060" style="s2">they would run a counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.630" end="00:02:51.739" style="s2">against that yeah so that&#39;s it in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.060" end="00:02:52.910" style="s2">nutshell oh and then the key part at</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.739" end="00:02:54.950" style="s2">least as I saw it is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.910" end="00:02:57.739" style="s2">recruiting an army of people to be their</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.950" end="00:03:00.140" style="s2">spreaders right they don&#39;t seem to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.739" end="00:03:05.090" style="s2">BOTS per se but rather they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.140" end="00:03:07.819" style="s2">organizing a decentralized narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:09.530" style="s2">multi broadcast point with potentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.819" end="00:03:12.769" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.530" end="00:03:16.250" style="s2">taking their you know counter arguments</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.769" end="00:03:18.380" style="s2">and posting them in a fairly regimented</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.250" end="00:03:20.299" style="s2">and highly automated way by the way on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.380" end="00:03:22.880" style="s2">Twitter and Facebook and various other</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.299" end="00:03:27.190" style="s2">platforms emailing them to people etc</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.880" end="00:03:30.049" style="s2">and so this essentially automating and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.190" end="00:03:33.110" style="s2">organizing what&#39;s been happening in a an</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.049" end="00:03:34.880" style="s2">automated and disorganized way by a you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.110" end="00:03:37.640" style="s2">know propagation of memes with links</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.880" end="00:03:41.180" style="s2">across social media and email well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.640" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">it&#39;s focusing on getting those key</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.180" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">influencers those independent</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">influencers to retweet the counter</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">narrative and or to post about it or</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:54.200" style="s2">write about it and I mean recruiting an</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:55.700" style="s2">army of people to make that possible or</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.200" end="00:03:57.440" style="s2">you know to distribute the information</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.700" end="00:04:00.079" style="s2">and get it into the hands of those key</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.440" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">influencers is a it&#39;s just a way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.079" end="00:04:05.620" style="s2">working around the rules at Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:08.329" style="s2">other sites have you know blocking BOTS</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.620" end="00:04:11.630" style="s2">what they&#39;re looking for is what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.329" end="00:04:14.870" style="s2">call a inauthentic communication in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.630" end="00:04:16.669" style="s2">authentic posts whatever that means so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.870" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">this is a way of working around that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.669" end="00:04:22.099" style="s2">you give a lot of people enlisted to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:25.010" style="s2">this and you can you can avoid getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.099" end="00:04:27.030" style="s2">snagged by those rules at least probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.010" end="00:04:29.850" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll say collusion we</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.030" end="00:04:32.970" style="s2">saw a hundred we just saw 17,000</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.850" end="00:04:36.090" style="s2">retweets of the same post or the or of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.970" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">the same link seems improbable us we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.090" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">see if there if there&#39;s a counter arms</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.830" end="00:04:41.669" style="s2">race against this oh yeah well most</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:43.560" style="s2">definitely there will be I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.669" end="00:04:46.410" style="s2">kind of like IEDs and in counter IEDs</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.560" end="00:04:48.660" style="s2">you know there&#39;s an innovation and ID</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.410" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">design and then there&#39;s a counter that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.660" end="00:04:53.610" style="s2">comes out months later six months later</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:56.460" style="s2">and then two weeks later there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.610" end="00:04:59.820" style="s2">innovation that neutralizes the the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:05:01.350" style="s2">counter IAD work so you know this is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.820" end="00:05:04.500" style="s2">definitely an arms race it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.350" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">global information war it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.500" end="00:05:10.110" style="s2">interesting maybe direction for where</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">parties are going you know political</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.110" end="00:05:14.100" style="s2">parties political networks are you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:16.200" style="s2">recruiting you know tens of thousands if</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.100" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">not millions of people to amplify a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.200" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">message yep to get it out and and doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">it in a formalized way I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">that&#39;s how parties evolve online is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">they they used to do it through</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:30.780" style="s2">influencing news coverage and now</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:34.140" style="s2">recruiting a million people to amplify a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.780" end="00:05:36.360" style="s2">message and doing it in a formal way is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.140" end="00:05:38.340" style="s2">probably how they earn their support</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.360" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">yeah seems like you know again I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.340" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">wrote about this in 2012 and a document</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:46.289" style="s2">not this exact form but the idea of sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">of discipline organized mimetic armies</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.289" end="00:05:50.640" style="s2">and we mentioned offense defense arms</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">race which will certainly happen for</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.640" end="00:05:56.810" style="s2">Julie the Twitter&#39;s and Facebook&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:06:00.330" style="s2">try to down-regulate these messages but</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.810" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">obviously platforms like this will try</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:03.210" style="s2">to work around that but the other which</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">I think is perhaps more interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:06.330" style="s2">gets to what you&#39;re talking about about</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:10.260" style="s2">this might be the politics of the future</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.330" end="00:06:14.039" style="s2">is the offense offense arms race where</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.260" end="00:06:17.580" style="s2">let&#39;s say these anti Trump folks build</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.039" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">up their army of 25,000 the Trump stirs</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.580" end="00:06:23.400" style="s2">then build up their arm you have 200,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">right and and so as you as you indicate</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.400" end="00:06:27.870" style="s2">this could be the future of how the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:30.840" style="s2">parties actually communicate and as we</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.870" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">know online this course is way less</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.840" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">discipline can turn way uglier</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:37.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a controlling mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">and the thing that came to my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.590" end="00:06:40.860" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s think this arms race going</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:42.900" style="s2">through two or three</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.860" end="00:06:44.430" style="s2">cycles here and of course in internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.900" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">time two or three cycles might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.430" end="00:06:49.439" style="s2">between now and September and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:54.629" style="s2">what it might look like is Germany in</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:24.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the biggest failure that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:27.090" style="s2">Democrats have had and this instance is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.600" end="00:09:29.970" style="s2">that they have not jumped in front of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.090" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">solving the pandemic I mean completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.970" end="00:09:34.950" style="s2">abdicated it and they&#39;re not moving that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:36.900" style="s2">consensus forward or whoever if whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.950" end="00:09:38.460" style="s2">it&#39;s Democrats or anybody who stood in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.900" end="00:09:39.990" style="s2">front of this and actually said okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.460" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">let&#39;s coordinate the efforts to get this</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.990" end="00:09:43.830" style="s2">thing solved well the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">governors are doing a reasonably good</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.830" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">job certainly better than the real look</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.660" end="00:09:48.960" style="s2">at governor&#39;s on a state-by-state basis</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:50.940" style="s2">but there&#39;s a you know there&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.960" end="00:09:52.710" style="s2">plan we talked last time about a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.940" end="00:09:54.540" style="s2">a doing that kind of national broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.710" end="00:09:56.790" style="s2">taking in all these open source efforts</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.540" end="00:09:58.260" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of cool</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.790" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">stuff that could be done I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.260" end="00:10:01.230" style="s2">we&#39;re talking this morning or I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:02.730" style="s2">talking to some people this morning</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.230" end="00:10:04.470" style="s2">about the National Guard being mobilized</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.730" end="00:10:06.270" style="s2">and there&#39;s more National Guard being</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.470" end="00:10:08.490" style="s2">already mobilized in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.270" end="00:10:10.220" style="s2">and the Canadian and UK military&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.490" end="00:10:11.970" style="s2">combined it&#39;s it&#39;s been a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.220" end="00:10:15.420" style="s2">mobilization that&#39;s going through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.970" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">end of June and there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.420" end="00:10:19.110" style="s2">slight I mean these these these Guard</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:20.730" style="s2">soldiers are out there you know at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.110" end="00:10:22.260" style="s2">meatpacking plants and in other places</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.730" end="00:10:24.420" style="s2">you know critical infrastructure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.260" end="00:10:27.480" style="s2">been you know taken down because of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.420" end="00:10:29.670" style="s2">pandemic and there&#39;s you know supporting</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.480" end="00:10:32.250" style="s2">the kind of reboot of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.670" end="00:10:34.170" style="s2">infrastructure and it occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.250" end="00:10:35.970" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s a whole new space</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.170" end="00:10:39.050" style="s2">that could be developed kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.970" end="00:10:43.110" style="s2">universal guard a Swiss Army knife of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.050" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">mobilization that where you bring a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.110" end="00:10:46.590" style="s2">group of people that are have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">capacity and the ability to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.590" end="00:10:52.050" style="s2">quickly and and the willingness to work</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:53.670" style="s2">hard and those people could be mobilized</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.050" end="00:10:55.110" style="s2">and once you&#39;ve you know kind of vetted</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.670" end="00:10:57.150" style="s2">the list and those people could be</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.110" end="00:10:59.300" style="s2">mobilized to come into a situation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.150" end="00:11:01.380" style="s2">get that infrastructure going again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.300" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">this works at the national scale or</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.380" end="00:11:04.690" style="s2">maybe even at the community scale where</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.870" style="s2">you have a group of people that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.690" end="00:11:10.330" style="s2">these kind of you know array of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.870" end="00:11:12.790" style="s2">subspecialties and or just a billet II</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.330" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">to learn quickly I mean now that with we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.790" end="00:11:15.640" style="s2">have access to all this information if</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">you have the ability to learn quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.640" end="00:11:21.430" style="s2">you can boot yourself up really quick</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:23.710" style="s2">you know very very fast and then get</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.430" end="00:11:26.620" style="s2">them to come in and get a factory going</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.710" end="00:11:28.810" style="s2">again and getting the PPP on or PPE on</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.620" end="00:11:30.910" style="s2">and and and and in doing it in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.810" end="00:11:32.740" style="s2">way until the the regular workforce can</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.910" end="00:11:34.450" style="s2">come back in and you can see this you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.740" end="00:11:36.100" style="s2">know that could that could be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.450" end="00:11:37.870" style="s2">force that would really be something</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.100" end="00:11:40.150" style="s2">that could be coordinated a national</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.870" end="00:11:42.790" style="s2">level but you know there&#39;s this moving</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.150" end="00:11:44.920" style="s2">the the solution set forward is really</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.790" end="00:11:46.870" style="s2">the way to kind of consolidate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.920" end="00:11:48.990" style="s2">consensus thing and make it feel like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.870" end="00:11:52.030" style="s2">it&#39;s actually moving in a direction that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.990" end="00:11:55.480" style="s2">has some kind of positive conclusion and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.030" end="00:11:57.700" style="s2">that grows it that grows the the center</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.480" end="00:11:59.800" style="s2">of gravity makes it you know increases</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.700" end="00:12:01.570" style="s2">the attraction of it and accumulates</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.800" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">more people and pulls them out of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.570" end="00:12:05.260" style="s2">descent you could imagine this little</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:07.750" style="s2">Swiss Army knife militia being</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:09.850" style="s2">unofficial you know being say an arm of</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.850" end="00:12:14.620" style="s2">could be I mean you think of it also at</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.340" end="00:12:15.850" style="s2">the local level is is you have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.620" end="00:12:18.070" style="s2">critical infrastructure that could be</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.720" end="00:12:25.030" style="s2">they can can do that that that have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:27.220" style="s2">vetted and vouched for and are willing</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.030" end="00:12:29.140" style="s2">to you know pitch in and come in and do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.220" end="00:12:30.910" style="s2">the what&#39;s necessary to actually you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.140" end="00:12:34.810" style="s2">know boot that piece of infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.910" end="00:12:36.790" style="s2">back up after it&#39;s been shut down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.810" end="00:12:38.290" style="s2">even a more powerful if they if the you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.790" end="00:12:40.090" style="s2">know local government willing to fund it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.290" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">so you know willing to pay the people to</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.530" end="00:12:59.350" style="s2">economic shitstorm that&#39;s about the land</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.339" end="00:13:02.830" style="s2">or his head has been landing and will</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.350" end="00:13:04.780" style="s2">become more obvious in about a month is</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.830" end="00:13:06.310" style="s2">going to prune the economic field</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.780" end="00:13:10.450" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be winners and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.310" end="00:13:12.190" style="s2">gonna be losers any thoughts on how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.450" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">might think about who are likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:15.610" style="s2">the winners we&#39;re going to be the losers</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:18.010" style="s2">who are gonna be least relatively</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.610" end="00:13:18.400" style="s2">stronger against their competition on</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:21.820" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.400" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">backside of this thing right yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.820" end="00:13:27.220" style="s2">there that there&#39;s the pure-play</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:28.600" style="s2">companies that are only only viable in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.220" end="00:13:30.040" style="s2">the pandemic when things are shut down</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.600" end="00:13:33.160" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the ones that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.040" end="00:13:35.290" style="s2">straddle both sides you know my son&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.160" end="00:13:36.550" style="s2">company codecademy he&#39;s his company</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.290" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">straddles both sides they make money</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.550" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">when their they&#39;ve been making money</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">when they&#39;re there is an append emic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:44.770" style="s2">they&#39;ll make money they&#39;re making more</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:49.540" style="s2">money now that there is so they you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.770" end="00:13:52.210" style="s2">they can handle both conditions Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.540" end="00:13:54.310" style="s2">certainly in that camp the strongest the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.210" end="00:13:57.880" style="s2">strongest players will be the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.310" end="00:14:01.480" style="s2">can you know handle coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.880" end="00:14:03.070" style="s2">pandemic as well as they&#39;re making a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.480" end="00:14:04.990" style="s2">of money right now during the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.070" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">I mean Amazon added what a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.990" end="00:14:06.790" style="s2">seventy-five thousand employees in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">last couple months</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.790" end="00:14:11.230" style="s2">so they&#39;re making a money hand over fist</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:13.570" style="s2">on this my bigger worry is more like is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.230" end="00:14:17.530" style="s2">that the you know US government is at</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.570" end="00:14:20.590" style="s2">risk here because we&#39;re benefiting right</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.530" end="00:14:23.140" style="s2">now from this flight to safety it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.590" end="00:14:25.060" style="s2">keeping our borrowing rates in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.140" end="00:14:28.960" style="s2">cellar I mean it&#39;s really cheap to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.060" end="00:14:32.140" style="s2">borrow right now for the US and if this</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.960" end="00:14:34.420" style="s2">persists and if this crisis persists and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.140" end="00:14:37.660" style="s2">and and you know relative to everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.420" end="00:14:40.030" style="s2">else it may be something that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.660" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">reverses and that will see people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.030" end="00:14:44.860" style="s2">fleeing the united states and fleeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:46.870" style="s2">the dollar and driving up our rates and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.860" end="00:14:49.570" style="s2">that could cause a whole cascade of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.870" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">problems for us yeah that&#39;s that problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.570" end="00:14:54.130" style="s2">is sitting out there for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:56.050" style="s2">this epoch of cheap money for federal</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.130" end="00:14:58.540" style="s2">borrowing is the only thing that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.050" end="00:15:01.090" style="s2">our even previous stack of debt at 20</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.540" end="00:15:03.160" style="s2">trillion dollars from crushing us if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.090" end="00:15:05.050" style="s2">paid the the historical average federal</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.160" end="00:15:07.030" style="s2">front funds rate which is about five</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.050" end="00:15:09.400" style="s2">percent across all averaged across all</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.030" end="00:15:11.350" style="s2">maturities you know we&#39;d be laying out</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.400" end="00:15:14.580" style="s2">something about seventy percent of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.350" end="00:15:18.910" style="s2">income tax receipts just on interest</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.580" end="00:15:20.950" style="s2">right and so this you know this sword of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.910" end="00:15:23.590" style="s2">damocles has been hanging over us for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.950" end="00:15:27.190" style="s2">long while and it could be particularly</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.590" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">if we miss play both the public health</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.190" end="00:15:31.420" style="s2">side which it looks like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.259" style="s2">chance that we&#39;re doing and the fiscal</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.420" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.259" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">we could be in a world of hurt we may</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:37.869" style="s2">lose our status as the world&#39;s reserve</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:41.470" style="s2">currency yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s benefits</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.869" end="00:15:44.559" style="s2">to cohesion and stability and being the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:47.709" style="s2">most cohesive and most stable country of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.559" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">any size for for a long time as has</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.709" end="00:15:51.639" style="s2">yielded us you know incredible benefits</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:54.220" style="s2">as the world became on more unstable and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.639" end="00:15:57.369" style="s2">more chaotic but if that reverses at all</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.220" end="00:15:58.509" style="s2">oh boy the decline can be very very</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.369" end="00:16:00.699" style="s2">quickly yeah I could be a phase change</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.509" end="00:16:04.149" style="s2">as we&#39;d say in complexity science where</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.699" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">we go from the perception of high</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.149" end="00:16:08.410" style="s2">cohesion and coherence which frankly has</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:12.459" style="s2">probably not really been true for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.410" end="00:16:14.979" style="s2">last 10 or 15 years to a state where</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.459" end="00:16:17.019" style="s2">people recognize the fact that the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.979" end="00:16:19.119" style="s2">is in a bad way and more or less</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.019" end="00:16:20.709" style="s2">dysfunctional even though again I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.119" end="00:16:23.169" style="s2">point to the fact that it probably has</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.709" end="00:16:25.749" style="s2">been dysfunctional for 15 years but</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.169" end="00:16:28.419" style="s2">people weren&#39;t really aware of it yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.749" end="00:16:30.279" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s a it goes back to my</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.419" end="00:16:32.259" style="s2">challenge for the 21st century at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.279" end="00:16:34.689" style="s2">for nation-states is to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.259" end="00:16:36.339" style="s2">cohesion in the face of a complex world</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.689" end="00:16:38.919" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re just throwing off you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.339" end="00:16:39.549" style="s2">complex crises again and at you know one</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.919" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">after another</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.549" end="00:16:44.139" style="s2">I mean first 9/11 and then the financial</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:47.109" style="s2">crisis and and now this I mean a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.139" end="00:16:50.589" style="s2">that has embedded nonlinearities and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.109" end="00:16:52.389" style="s2">has lots of uncertainties and even if</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.589" end="00:16:54.220" style="s2">you dig into it you&#39;ll uncover even more</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.389" end="00:16:56.559" style="s2">uncertainty you know that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.220" end="00:16:58.629" style="s2">that actually turns a crisis that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.559" end="00:17:00.579" style="s2">know people talk about predicting the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.629" end="00:17:02.410" style="s2">pandemic and and you can predict the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.579" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">kind of broad outline of a pandemic but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.410" end="00:17:06.730" style="s2">the one that really gets you is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:07.179" style="s2">complex one and the one that keeps on</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.730" end="00:17:09.100" style="s2">giving</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.179" end="00:17:11.350" style="s2">I mean even if you&#39;re even if you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.100" end="00:17:13.480" style="s2">it&#39;s what it is and and how it operates</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.350" end="00:17:14.829" style="s2">you still can&#39;t deal with all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.480" end="00:17:18.039" style="s2">complexity that you&#39;re being faced with</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.829" end="00:17:20.889" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly changing and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.039" end="00:17:24.010" style="s2">challenge is is ongoing and it does so</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.889" end="00:17:26.409" style="s2">much damage over so much time that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.010" end="00:17:28.510" style="s2">end up seeing massive change in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.409" end="00:17:31.240" style="s2">social structures that are built to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.510" end="00:17:33.850" style="s2">confront it and we saw that with 9/11</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.240" end="00:17:36.929" style="s2">yielded the G watt the Global War on</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.850" end="00:17:38.889" style="s2">Terror and yielded all sorts of changes</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.929" end="00:17:43.090" style="s2">to the US government terms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.889" end="00:17:45.809" style="s2">militarizing police and etc and spending</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.090" end="00:17:47.820" style="s2">gobs of money six trillion dollars on</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.809" end="00:17:49.950" style="s2">Wars that we shouldn&#39;t have spent and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.820" end="00:17:51.929" style="s2">then the financial crisis obviously did</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.950" end="00:17:53.429" style="s2">a lot in terms of D little izing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.929" end="00:17:55.259" style="s2">government in German you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.429" end="00:17:56.489" style="s2">inability to actually punish the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.259" end="00:17:59.909" style="s2">who committed the FRA</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.489" end="00:18:02.940" style="s2">so these complex situations are these</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.909" end="00:18:05.070" style="s2">complex threats can can can keep on</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.940" end="00:18:06.749" style="s2">giving over decades yeah and then this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.070" end="00:18:11.070" style="s2">is a very very important point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.749" end="00:18:13.409" style="s2">hitting here on John which is frankly no</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.070" end="00:18:17.639" style="s2">country on earth is actually very good</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.409" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">at dealing with complex situations you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.639" end="00:18:22.739" style="s2">know nonlinear embedded nonlinearities</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:25.409" style="s2">without the complete set of data in fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.739" end="00:18:26.759" style="s2">the usual real world big problem you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.409" end="00:18:28.499" style="s2">only have part of the data you know for</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.759" end="00:18:30.929" style="s2">instance the pandemic well we knew</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.499" end="00:18:32.279" style="s2">pandemics happen just look at the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.929" end="00:18:34.200" style="s2">occurrence rate you know about one every</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.279" end="00:18:36.089" style="s2">ten years but what are the parameter</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.200" end="00:18:38.009" style="s2">settings this one happened to have a set</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.089" end="00:18:40.649" style="s2">of parameter settings that people hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.009" end="00:18:42.539" style="s2">thought of which is sort of just lethal</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.649" end="00:18:45.409" style="s2">enough as we talked about last time to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.539" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">be very scary and disturbing but not</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.409" end="00:18:49.889" style="s2">murderously lethal like MERS or</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:51.659" style="s2">something but highly highly contagious</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.889" end="00:18:53.219" style="s2">asymptomatic so it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.659" end="00:18:54.629" style="s2">parameter space suspect I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.219" end="00:18:56.879" style="s2">an essay right now I&#39;d love to send you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.629" end="00:18:59.729" style="s2">a copy of it for your thoughts before I</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.879" end="00:19:02.070" style="s2">actually publish it asking the US</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.729" end="00:19:04.919" style="s2">government to establish a department of</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.469" end="00:19:15.389" style="s2">can think of it almost like a planning</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.539" end="00:19:17.940" style="s2">staff like the military has but for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.389" end="00:19:19.499" style="s2">civilian sector which will enumerate as</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.749" end="00:19:29.369" style="s2">you know several others which I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.820" end="00:19:31.289" style="s2">enumerate and does some probing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.369" end="00:19:34.950" style="s2">leading edge thinkers for all right what</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.289" end="00:19:36.659" style="s2">about what unknown unknowns could could</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.950" end="00:19:38.309" style="s2">become known or at least speculated</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.659" end="00:19:40.679" style="s2">apart and have act and then would</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.309" end="00:19:43.259" style="s2">actually build models that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.679" end="00:19:46.229" style="s2">parameterised for as many of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.259" end="00:19:48.659" style="s2">situations as they could afford and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.229" end="00:19:50.489" style="s2">know so that again complex thinking does</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.659" end="00:19:53.599" style="s2">not come naturally to humans we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.489" end="00:19:55.499" style="s2">raised in a world where high</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.599" end="00:19:57.059" style="s2">nonlinearities that play out over short</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.499" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">periods of time really impact that our</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.059" end="00:20:03.490" style="s2">lives very often may be a forest fire</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:05.870" style="s2">like that but not too often and now our</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.490" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">societies are going to be put at risk of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.870" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">at least extreme damage if not actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:12.590" style="s2">collapse by one wicked risk after</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">another and it seems to me just like we</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.590" end="00:20:15.350" style="s2">have a Department of Defense we also</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:17.960" style="s2">have to have a department of wicked</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.350" end="00:20:19.880" style="s2">risks yeah and a lot of this stuff has</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.960" end="00:20:24.020" style="s2">to do with them changing our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.880" end="00:20:25.820" style="s2">on response and and you know we we try</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.020" end="00:20:28.760" style="s2">to solve these problems with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.820" end="00:20:31.460" style="s2">traditional thinking and it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.760" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">work I mean for instance that the way in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.460" end="00:20:37.220" style="s2">which we shut down international borders</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:39.290" style="s2">women were slow and methodical and we do</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.220" end="00:20:41.540" style="s2">try to do it selectively but with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.290" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">kind of threat you have to do it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.540" end="00:20:46.429" style="s2">and all at once yep because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:48.770" style="s2">easy to route around but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.429" end="00:20:50.390" style="s2">these assumptions that we have about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.770" end="00:20:53.390" style="s2">things operate and and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.390" end="00:20:55.400" style="s2">optimize the solution and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.390" end="00:20:58.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to kind of target the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.400" end="00:20:59.809" style="s2">bailout money or that we should do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.190" end="00:21:02.450" style="s2">higher in the stack and focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.809" end="00:21:05.179" style="s2">corporations versus individuals I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.450" end="00:21:06.860" style="s2">all of these things are clearly mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.179" end="00:21:08.710" style="s2">if you look at it from a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.860" end="00:21:12.410" style="s2">perspective and looking at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.710" end="00:21:14.690" style="s2">perspective of complexities just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.410" end="00:21:16.130" style="s2">different kind of assumptions that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.690" end="00:21:19.330" style="s2">know we don&#39;t know the particulars of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.130" end="00:21:22.429" style="s2">any given crisis in you know what we do</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.330" end="00:21:27.080" style="s2">have the ability to develop a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.429" end="00:21:28.940" style="s2">general response methodology a way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.080" end="00:21:31.700" style="s2">kind of responding to these things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.940" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">that you know that kind of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.700" end="00:21:35.090" style="s2">a crisis group that you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:38.120" style="s2">about you know just no notice the kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.090" end="00:21:40.130" style="s2">of gut level instinct as to what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.120" end="00:21:42.590" style="s2">direction who we should be heading into</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.130" end="00:21:44.660" style="s2">and can simulate it right maybe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.590" end="00:21:47.059" style="s2">that was one thing but having mature</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.660" end="00:21:48.860" style="s2">various teams usually we know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.059" end="00:21:50.510" style="s2">like in climate change different models</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.860" end="00:21:52.340" style="s2">give different results but when you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.510" end="00:21:54.290" style="s2">an ensemble of models created</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.340" end="00:21:57.650" style="s2">independently that gives similar results</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.290" end="00:21:59.030" style="s2">it gives a lot of confidence in in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:00.380" style="s2">situation so I would imagine this</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.030" end="00:22:02.030" style="s2">department not only having its own</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.380" end="00:22:04.370" style="s2">modelers but also being a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.030" end="00:22:06.200" style="s2">significant source of funding to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.370" end="00:22:08.600" style="s2">academic researchers to build models</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.200" end="00:22:10.910" style="s2">using entirely fresh code code bases</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:13.010" style="s2">entirely fresh ideas and have those</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.910" end="00:22:16.730" style="s2">models up and running and be ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.010" end="00:22:18.620" style="s2">at need rather than you know the the you</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.730" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">know the very halting and whole series</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.620" end="00:22:23.450" style="s2">of bad decisions that we see made and oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:26.930" style="s2">by the way it did turn out that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.450" end="00:22:29.720" style="s2">was one simple way to partially at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.930" end="00:22:32.150" style="s2">tame the pandemic on the front end which</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.720" end="00:22:33.590" style="s2">was social distancing yeah and those</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.150" end="00:22:35.870" style="s2">come those countries that were willing</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.590" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">to do it firmly and hard unlike the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.870" end="00:22:39.380" style="s2">United States I&#39;ve actually really</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">pushed their case countdown but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.380" end="00:22:43.430" style="s2">backsides gonna be way more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">this is not just one simple rubber</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.430" end="00:22:48.560" style="s2">mallet right now we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:50.150" style="s2">manage contact tracing escalated and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.560" end="00:22:51.980" style="s2">testing and not only escalating testing</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.150" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">but then optimizing how do you use the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.980" end="00:22:55.670" style="s2">test do you use them on people high</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:57.880" style="s2">probability of being sick or do you use</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.670" end="00:22:59.930" style="s2">part of that as a background</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.880" end="00:23:02.510" style="s2">instrumentation to see your base case</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.930" end="00:23:04.190" style="s2">rates right you want to do both but our</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.510" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">current people capable of thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.190" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:09.770" style="s2">coupling between the public health</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:13.220" style="s2">problems and the economic problems are</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.770" end="00:23:14.750" style="s2">classic nonlinear coupled systems which</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.220" end="00:23:16.550" style="s2">are I hate to say it beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.750" end="00:23:17.810" style="s2">cognitive ability at least the people I</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.550" end="00:23:19.820" style="s2">see at the highest levels of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.810" end="00:23:22.370" style="s2">government so these are gonna be you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.820" end="00:23:24.350" style="s2">know challenges that that are this will</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.370" end="00:23:25.910" style="s2">not be the last time we face this so</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.350" end="00:23:28.010" style="s2">this may be one of the great exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.910" end="00:23:29.720" style="s2">which allows us to think about how we</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.010" end="00:23:32.330" style="s2">should build some institutional response</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.720" end="00:23:34.430" style="s2">for the future yeah I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.330" end="00:23:37.040" style="s2">modeling aspect of this is great at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.430" end="00:23:39.260" style="s2">at the very very early warning grate and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.040" end="00:23:41.300" style="s2">then once you identified that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.260" end="00:23:42.980" style="s2">complex threat then you go okay what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.300" end="00:23:45.050" style="s2">quick frames can we put on this to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.980" end="00:23:46.850" style="s2">some immediate decisions and then you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.050" end="00:23:50.060" style="s2">the more complex or more detailed</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.850" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">modeling to refine that there was early</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.060" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">decisions but you can&#39;t wait until</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:57.110" style="s2">everything is like all the analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:23:59.300" style="s2">done like on masks or universal masking</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.110" end="00:24:00.950" style="s2">right I mean do you have to run all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.300" end="00:24:02.780" style="s2">tests and do all the science necessary</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.950" end="00:24:05.300" style="s2">to prove that it that it works at me</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.780" end="00:24:07.820" style="s2">probably not yeah a funny thing about</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.300" end="00:24:08.840" style="s2">masking I was saying it from the day one</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.820" end="00:24:11.960" style="s2">when they were talking about masking</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.840" end="00:24:13.820" style="s2">idiots the the thing about playing it on</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.960" end="00:24:16.310" style="s2">the model you could actually find this</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.820" end="00:24:17.930" style="s2">in a very simple model if the mask is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.310" end="00:24:20.270" style="s2">not to protect the inbound that it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.930" end="00:24:21.680" style="s2">reduce the outbound you know just put</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.270" end="00:24:24.140" style="s2">that in your model right right it&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.680" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">fucking obvious right but it took you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.140" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">know what a month for the u.s. to come</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:29.470" style="s2">to a consent</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:30.650" style="s2">this and even that now reluctantly and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.470" end="00:24:33.050" style="s2">politically-charged</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.650" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">that masks are a good idea all you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.050" end="00:24:38.600" style="s2">to do is think the one frame changed</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:40.790" style="s2">that this is reduces outbound not in bap</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.600" end="00:24:42.170" style="s2">and yes master cheap you of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.790" end="00:24:44.390" style="s2">should do them why should there have</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.170" end="00:24:45.950" style="s2">been any discussion about it but it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.390" end="00:24:47.960" style="s2">a lesson learned from a hundred years of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.950" end="00:24:50.360" style="s2">infection control in hospitals exactly</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.960" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">why if that&#39;s just common wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.360" end="00:24:53.060" style="s2">hospitals and you know common practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:54.650" style="s2">and you just go with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.060" end="00:24:56.210" style="s2">you want to take a month to reach a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.650" end="00:24:58.250" style="s2">consensus and that might by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.210" end="00:25:00.200" style="s2">consensus is not even firm in the United</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.250" end="00:25:01.850" style="s2">States it&#39;s now apparently become</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.200" end="00:25:05.390" style="s2">politically charged in certain</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.070" end="00:25:14.570" style="s2">what the fuck is wrong with people</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.350" end="00:25:17.210" style="s2">anyway let&#39;s move on to our third and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.570" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">final topic which you posted on very</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.210" end="00:25:21.740" style="s2">recently which is you know we have these</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">regional blocks of states which are</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.740" end="00:25:25.850" style="s2">working in a coordinated and seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:28.310" style="s2">reasonably intelligent fashion that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.850" end="00:25:30.380" style="s2">reduce caseloads towards zero maybe to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.310" end="00:25:32.600" style="s2">zero and then we have other states which</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.380" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">aren&#39;t parts of these regional blocks</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.600" end="00:25:36.830" style="s2">and maybe someone maybe there&#39;s some new</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:39.500" style="s2">regional blocks of scoffers who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.830" end="00:25:41.330" style="s2">opening up very early in you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.500" end="00:25:43.040" style="s2">already seen some reports in the media</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.330" end="00:25:45.080" style="s2">that even the administration&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.040" end="00:25:48.650" style="s2">models are showing holy shit this could</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.080" end="00:25:51.080" style="s2">produce a whole bunch of cases and no</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.650" end="00:25:53.870" style="s2">real resurgence in those areas and knees</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.080" end="00:25:56.090" style="s2">and you suggest mmm could it be that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.870" end="00:25:58.430" style="s2">might have to have hard border controls</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.090" end="00:25:59.960" style="s2">between US regional bloc&#39;s what do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.430" end="00:26:02.030" style="s2">think about that yeah couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.960" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">though one thing I saw in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.030" end="00:26:08.510" style="s2">behavior in in Asia early on is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:11.330" style="s2">border controls were pretty loose in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.510" end="00:26:15.370" style="s2">China and other places until they got</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.330" end="00:26:18.020" style="s2">the caseload down to nearly zero and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.370" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">then they saw a resurgence of cases and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.020" end="00:26:21.290" style="s2">there were all those cases were coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:23.240" style="s2">from the outside and so they quickly</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.290" end="00:26:25.670" style="s2">went to hard border controls</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.240" end="00:26:28.520" style="s2">you know quarantine say we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.670" end="00:26:30.980" style="s2">make you know take that step and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.520" end="00:26:32.900" style="s2">the other piece of evidence is that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.980" end="00:26:34.430" style="s2">know the the countries that took early</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.900" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">action in terms of border controls like</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.430" end="00:26:40.100" style="s2">from a Taiwan Japan Greece even so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">know where they closed the physical</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.100" end="00:26:43.650" style="s2">borders</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:46.740" style="s2">very early on in the crisis have escaped</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.650" end="00:26:49.890" style="s2">almost all of the disaster that we seen</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.740" end="00:26:52.230" style="s2">so you combine those two you know after</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.890" end="00:26:54.179" style="s2">having win a one a you know a reduction</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.230" end="00:26:56.130" style="s2">and you&#39;ve taken to all that the pain</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.179" end="00:26:57.779" style="s2">associated with achieving that reduction</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.130" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">and then seeing all the new cases coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.779" end="00:27:04.020" style="s2">from the outside and the fact that it if</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:07.289" style="s2">you can coordinate yourself you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.020" end="00:27:09.510" style="s2">of externalize the quarantine and erect</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.289" end="00:27:11.490" style="s2">border so you can you can save yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.510" end="00:27:13.799" style="s2">a lot of hassle in the future that will</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.490" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">probably be driving the decision making</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.799" end="00:27:19.559" style="s2">of a lot of these big regional blocks we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:22.649" style="s2">see big reductions now in New York and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.559" end="00:27:24.870" style="s2">New Jersey and Massachusetts and others</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.649" end="00:27:27.990" style="s2">are holding the line they&#39;re not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.870" end="00:27:30.409" style="s2">any increase if those numbers start to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.990" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">come down by the end of the month and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.409" end="00:27:34.610" style="s2">the rest of the country starts to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:37.649" style="s2">like New Hampshire&#39;s about to open up</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:41.130" style="s2">you know Georgia obviously did last</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.649" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">Friday Texas did last Friday they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.130" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">singing you know surges in cases</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:46.679" style="s2">Illinois seeing a surge in cases</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:49.799" style="s2">Maryland</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.679" end="00:27:51.750" style="s2">if those places start to zoom again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.799" end="00:27:53.940" style="s2">just going to be a natural development</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.750" end="00:27:56.750" style="s2">that that the states that have won that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.940" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">decline will start to erect borders and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.750" end="00:28:03.539" style="s2">you know it&#39;s going to be a big shock a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:05.640" style="s2">big shock to a lot of people if this you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.539" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">know those administration numbers from</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.640" end="00:28:09.809" style="s2">from yesterday or pretty interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">that you know they were projecting a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.809" end="00:28:13.350" style="s2">increase to three thousand cases a day</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:16.529" style="s2">or three thousand deaths a day by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.350" end="00:28:18.690" style="s2">end of this month largely due and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.529" end="00:28:21.809" style="s2">that model was running at about a 50%</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.690" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">rate so it was like 50 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.809" end="00:28:27.870" style="s2">actual so in fact it was projecting a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:31.020" style="s2">six thousand dead a day by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.870" end="00:28:32.909" style="s2">this month largely due to reopening up</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.020" end="00:28:34.830" style="s2">from my twenty five hundred where it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.909" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">now yep six thousand a day for people</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.830" end="00:28:38.940" style="s2">just keep in mind that&#39;s close to 200</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">thousand dead people</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.940" end="00:28:45.659" style="s2">a month right which is two months worth</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">SAR total loss in World War two right</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.659" end="00:28:49.350" style="s2">yeah I mean three times the Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:51.030" style="s2">every month yeah yeah that&#39;s just just</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.350" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">staggering because because we have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.030" end="00:28:55.980" style="s2">unable and or unwilling to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:57.990" style="s2">the obvious thing which was to shutdown</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">but even states that are shut down this</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:03.870" style="s2">was drives me crazy Virginia relatively</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:06.210" style="s2">strong lockdown regulations the reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.870" end="00:29:07.710" style="s2">is there&#39;s huge amounts of leakage you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.210" end="00:29:09.150" style="s2">know and again if we&#39;d had this</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.710" end="00:29:10.530" style="s2">department of we could risk the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.150" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">simulations would have said the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.530" end="00:29:16.170" style="s2">answer is a four week very stringent</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.350" end="00:29:34.920" style="s2">know killed this thing in its tracks and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.910" end="00:29:37.980" style="s2">oh by the way we can then reopen the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.920" end="00:29:40.230" style="s2">economy fairly rapidly thereafter and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.980" end="00:29:41.850" style="s2">but and again the other thing they</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.230" end="00:29:45.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t take into consideration is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.850" end="00:29:48.690" style="s2">slow drippy leaky shutdown starts to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.300" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">deplete people&#39;s ability for vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.690" end="00:29:52.410" style="s2">you know it&#39;s right it turned out most</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.820" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">you get past four weeks it gets really</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.200" end="00:30:01.320" style="s2">hard and and I would survive seen</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:02.760" style="s2">research and I&#39;ve seen personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.320" end="00:30:05.280" style="s2">experience that says by time you get to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.760" end="00:30:07.890" style="s2">ten weeks it&#39;s damn near impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.280" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">maintain vigilance at least for a fair</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.890" end="00:30:11.970" style="s2">percentage of the population and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:14.040" style="s2">problem with a leaky shutdown is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.970" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2">takes a lot longer and so we&#39;re reaching</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.040" end="00:30:18.809" style="s2">where we soon be reaching that 10-week</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:21.170" style="s2">part that ten-week mark around the 1st</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.809" end="00:30:23.730" style="s2">of June most places and I expect</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.170" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">unfortunately we will see further</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.730" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">unraveling even in places that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:28.950" style="s2">trying to keep social distancing in</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:31.530" style="s2">place so should have been harder should</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.950" end="00:30:34.410" style="s2">have been faster yeah it the longer this</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.530" end="00:30:37.740" style="s2">goes the more at-risk the u.s. is in</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.410" end="00:30:39.750" style="s2">terms of staying together yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.740" end="00:30:41.400" style="s2">that&#39;s an outlier it&#39;s always been an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.750" end="00:30:44.370" style="s2">outlier obviously but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.400" end="00:30:46.650" style="s2">becoming increasingly possible yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.370" end="00:30:49.650" style="s2">see how this whole country could done</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.650" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">actually unwind it&#39;s the and you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.650" end="00:30:53.190" style="s2">actually even see it and in the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:55.410" style="s2">people you know who have actually been</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.190" end="00:30:57.809" style="s2">you know locked up for what two months</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.410" end="00:31:00.390" style="s2">now it in Massachusetts and and New York</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.809" end="00:31:01.950" style="s2">and sitting and watching and listening</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.390" end="00:31:03.750" style="s2">to people saying you know we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.950" end="00:31:05.340" style="s2">to do anything I mean people who just</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.750" end="00:31:07.290" style="s2">spend a week or two it like in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.340" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">lockdown and complaining about it in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.290" end="00:31:10.560" style="s2">other states</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:13.980" style="s2">and then becoming the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.560" end="00:31:15.960" style="s2">pandemic that enmity that anger could</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.980" end="00:31:17.940" style="s2">end up you know being you know the</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.140" end="00:31:33.030" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to source manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.730" end="00:31:35.540" style="s2">and you can start to see maybe taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.030" end="00:31:39.060" style="s2">preeminence over resources and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.540" end="00:31:41.040" style="s2">control over resources that a head of</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.040" end="00:31:45.480" style="s2">here now for actually seeing a break up</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.590" end="00:31:47.580" style="s2">yep and frankly I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.480" end="00:31:50.190" style="s2">bad idea I know I think you and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.580" end="00:31:51.720" style="s2">disagree on this one but maybe not oh no</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.190" end="00:31:54.510" style="s2">I know I don&#39;t necessarily disagree I</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.720" end="00:31:56.310" style="s2">mean it made it you know I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.510" end="00:31:57.510" style="s2">probably more in the camp of actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.310" end="00:31:59.250" style="s2">seeing a breakup might be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.510" end="00:32:01.770" style="s2">good because you know my view the what</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.250" end="00:32:04.740" style="s2">worried I&#39;ve said this is coming clean</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.770" end="00:32:06.570" style="s2">creasing Lee clear that California and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.740" end="00:32:09.660" style="s2">Mississippi are both getting very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.570" end="00:32:13.020" style="s2">tired of the other having a partial veto</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.660" end="00:32:15.480" style="s2">on how they run their societies right</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.020" end="00:32:18.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s just a braid about the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.480" end="00:32:21.390" style="s2">extreme version of it right but and but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.780" end="00:32:23.430" style="s2">there&#39;s at least two rough blocks in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.390" end="00:32:25.350" style="s2">country and you know four or five is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.430" end="00:32:27.750" style="s2">unreasonable either and frankly they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.350" end="00:32:29.340" style="s2">all be a lot happier if they got</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.490" end="00:32:44.490" style="s2">Mississippi wants to a outlaw abortion</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.860" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">let them write right and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.490" end="00:32:50.160" style="s2">this might actually be a good thing to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:52.440" style="s2">release this decoherence right because</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.160" end="00:32:55.080" style="s2">clearly we can have more social</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.440" end="00:32:57.420" style="s2">coherence in smaller units that are more</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.080" end="00:33:00.210" style="s2">culturally homogeneous than we can in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.420" end="00:33:02.760" style="s2">what&#39;s becoming a very highly polarized</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.210" end="00:33:05.070" style="s2">country yeah that&#39;s more like 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.760" end="00:33:07.170" style="s2">America means can we is there a way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.070" end="00:33:09.510" style="s2">kind of an organized retreat where you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.170" end="00:33:11.190" style="s2">you weaken the federal system we</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.510" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">confederal controls and limits on</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.190" end="00:33:14.940" style="s2">behavior you know we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:16.110" style="s2">through there&#39;s you know that had been</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.940" end="00:33:19.370" style="s2">instituted through the Supreme Court</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.110" end="00:33:21.280" style="s2">through through the through Congress</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.370" end="00:33:23.980" style="s2">bringing it back bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.280" end="00:33:25.810" style="s2">power to the states or do you see a hard</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.980" end="00:33:27.220" style="s2">breakup yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see it ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.810" end="00:33:28.570" style="s2">happened you know people never give up</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.220" end="00:33:30.730" style="s2">power right when was the last time</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.570" end="00:33:32.620" style="s2">somebody gave up power others rather</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.730" end="00:33:35.560" style="s2">than a radical phase change like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.620" end="00:33:38.680" style="s2">breakup of the Soviet Union so well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.560" end="00:33:41.050" style="s2">in theory we could roll back to 1931 but</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.680" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">I would bet long dollars against it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.050" end="00:33:47.140" style="s2">I think to achieve the same result a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:48.700" style="s2">much more likely scenario is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.140" end="00:33:49.900" style="s2">carve ourselves up into independent</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.700" end="00:33:53.830" style="s2">nations now we might still have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.900" end="00:33:55.750" style="s2">free-trade zone like the EU but in terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.830" end="00:33:57.490" style="s2">of yeah but how did Corbett Jeff killed</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.750" end="00:34:00.730" style="s2">us the Soviet Union it wasn&#39;t really I</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.490" end="00:34:02.500" style="s2">mean I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s in some ways kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.730" end="00:34:04.810" style="s2">of similar to what we&#39;re saying now with</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.500" end="00:34:06.700" style="s2">with Trump and the federal government I</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.810" end="00:34:09.340" style="s2">mean Trump may be the Gorbachev of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.700" end="00:34:12.220" style="s2">u.s. is that Gorbachev I mean started</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.340" end="00:34:13.870" style="s2">those those pilot projects in in private</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.220" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">ownership pilot projects and in certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.870" end="00:34:17.860" style="s2">sub sectors and that spun out of control</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:20.050" style="s2">when and then he started putting you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.860" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">know more and more restrictions on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.050" end="00:34:25.450" style="s2">Nama culture and and they started opting</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:27.429" style="s2">out yeah you know they started</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.450" end="00:34:29.110" style="s2">instituting those pilot projects and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.429" end="00:34:30.669" style="s2">starting you know grab resources and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.110" end="00:34:32.649" style="s2">selling them and making a fortune and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.669" end="00:34:33.669" style="s2">the whole thing kind of fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.649" end="00:34:35.590" style="s2">really really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.669" end="00:34:37.330" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m certainly not Gorbachev planner</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.590" end="00:34:39.940" style="s2">I actually had lunch with Gorbachev oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.330" end="00:34:42.490" style="s2">yeah a long long time ago and he was</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.940" end="00:34:43.330" style="s2">absolutely flabbergasted by the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.490" end="00:34:45.159" style="s2">thing right</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.330" end="00:34:47.290" style="s2">he thought he was you know he thought he</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.159" end="00:34:49.630" style="s2">was a gentle good reformer but he was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.290" end="00:34:51.480" style="s2">true to heart communist right that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.630" end="00:34:54.580" style="s2">whole thing blew up in his face was</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.480" end="00:34:56.620" style="s2">absolutely unintended it was not not his</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.580" end="00:34:58.300" style="s2">intent at all and and then the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.620" end="00:35:00.630" style="s2">thing here is letting the states and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.300" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">individuals fend for themselves on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.630" end="00:35:06.610" style="s2">may end up creating the impetus stack to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:09.370" style="s2">see these things break up I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.610" end="00:35:11.350" style="s2">know we&#39;re seeing a vast diminishment of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.370" end="00:35:13.000" style="s2">federal power I mean there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.350" end="00:35:15.880" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing anything a confident</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.000" end="00:35:19.180" style="s2">nation you know World War two America or</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.880" end="00:35:20.710" style="s2">Cold War America is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.180" end="00:35:22.630" style="s2">different place and what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.710" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">right now I mean total lack of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.630" end="00:35:26.110" style="s2">confidence and everything and anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:30.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no national will to get anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.110" end="00:35:32.380" style="s2">done and with forcing people to you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.520" end="00:35:34.300" style="s2">to make decisions on their own in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.380" end="00:35:36.970" style="s2">face of a crisis is the surest way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.300" end="00:35:39.430" style="s2">see thing breakup because they&#39;re going</p>
