<p begin="00:00:05.180" end="00:00:11.070" style="s2">so Hana you put together a film called</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">from women to men and it&#39;s gone pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.070" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">viral online it&#39;s had we think over</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:18.420" style="s2">about a million views</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">lots of polarized reactions and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.420" end="00:00:23.220" style="s2">as you say in the film what you want is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">to start a new conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.220" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">women and men and in the film it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">and a lot of other women including ile</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.250" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">am owning parts of themselves that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not proud of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">female shadow and it&#39;s created a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">polarized reaction but as as you say in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">the film you want to start a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">conversation between women and men so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">hopefully we can start that happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:54.030" style="s2">now but I&#39;d love to hear a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:55.620" style="s2">about your background and what you hope</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:00:57.059" style="s2">to achieve through the film what what</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.620" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">you want that conversation to look like</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.059" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">so I&#39;m working in conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">since more than 10 years and mediating</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:07.950" style="s2">huge conflicts on various levels it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">always the experiences always that our</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.950" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">concepts we are so used to thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">either I&#39;m right or you are right either</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">I&#39;m the victim or I&#39;m the perpetrator</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.890" style="s2">either I&#39;m wrong or you&#39;re wrong either</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">it&#39;s my fault or it&#39;s you fault</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.890" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">that they&#39;re never true and that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">are never leading anywhere I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">realized that it&#39;s as true what is true</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">for any every conflict is just true for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">the wounding between men and women and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">in the gender war as well and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">dreaming of a new step and a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.409" style="s2">dialogue at the cultural level it feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">like we&#39;re in a really dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.409" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">relationship between men and women and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">that I guess is what kind of where the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">film came from and also what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">trying to achieve through this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:55.530" style="s2">as well so to me it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">to analyze the wound between men and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.530" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">women because I think had some special</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">insights into years of prostitution ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.930" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">years ago in my life and when I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">writing a book about it like just one</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:11.210" style="s2">year ago I realized I&#39;m not the victim</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:14.210" style="s2">and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.210" end="00:02:16.370" style="s2">not the aggressor I&#39;m both roads as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.210" end="00:02:19.550" style="s2">prostitute and I think prostitute is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.370" end="00:02:21.080" style="s2">mainly seen as the victim and the client</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.550" end="00:02:23.150" style="s2">of prostitute is mainly seen as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.080" end="00:02:25.430" style="s2">aggressor and when I started writing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.150" end="00:02:28.850" style="s2">about the clients sexuality as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.430" end="00:02:31.070" style="s2">remember it I felt we have not address</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.850" end="00:02:33.230" style="s2">us they are not the winners and no</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.070" end="00:02:35.150" style="s2">client on earth feels like a winner</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.230" end="00:02:37.610" style="s2">they are sufferer they suffering so</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.150" end="00:02:41.450" style="s2">deeply and are helpless and overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.610" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">and like also victims and I think by</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.450" end="00:02:46.670" style="s2">writing this I somehow surprised myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:48.920" style="s2">and then Hanif wrote to me in email</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.670" end="00:02:52.600" style="s2">because she read this book when I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.920" end="00:02:56.780" style="s2">your script just just came out of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.600" end="00:02:59.720" style="s2">inspiration and I think then we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.780" end="00:03:03.320" style="s2">these perilous and fear felt this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.720" end="00:03:06.980" style="s2">new aspect or dynamics between the sexes</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.320" end="00:03:09.050" style="s2">that is as needed as me too and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.980" end="00:03:11.450" style="s2">think due to this book and the parallel</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.050" end="00:03:15.230" style="s2">to the film we got close with each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.450" end="00:03:17.540" style="s2">very soon and I was reading the script</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.230" end="00:03:19.490" style="s2">and feeling whoa after all the trailer</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.540" end="00:03:21.560" style="s2">doing stuff that I&#39;d written this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.490" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">really challenging and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.560" end="00:03:27.230" style="s2">taboo and then I need a time to digest</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">and also I had an immediately immediate</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.230" end="00:03:32.600" style="s2">yes at the same time I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:35.330" style="s2">push myself over my limits because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:38.330" style="s2">felt it&#39;s not about my shadow was gone</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.330" end="00:03:40.790" style="s2">when I participate in the film it&#39;s whoa</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.330" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">I&#39;m more deeply connected with my shadow</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.790" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">it&#39;s still there and so I I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:49.310" style="s2">happy about the time between getting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:50.900" style="s2">know the script and participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.310" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">film because it was already a huge</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.900" end="00:03:55.880" style="s2">healing journey for me and it went on</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:57.950" style="s2">after the film I&#39;m so so grateful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.880" end="00:04:00.440" style="s2">touched by this invitation I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.950" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">because it really opens another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.440" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">of an interesting and lively dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:07.210" style="s2">instead of something where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.760" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">say are we the good ones or the bad ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.210" end="00:04:14.570" style="s2">and it seems as if collectively I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:17.030" style="s2">know some something is ready that things</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.570" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">show up now and in the meat too we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.030" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">see that really the female wounding has</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">up I said look what happens we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.660" style="s2">about this obviously quite a few times</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:30.110" style="s2">before and what I&#39;m really fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.660" end="00:04:32.389" style="s2">about is that your your background seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.110" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">to kind of mirror a lot of the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.389" end="00:04:37.370" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing now that it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">goes back to the 70s the first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.370" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">move the first kind of eruption of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:43.880" style="s2">women&#39;s movement I&#39;ll let you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:45.970" style="s2">tell the story but it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.880" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">interesting kind of life story in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.970" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">experience I come from a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:55.639" style="s2">generation I was living in Berkeley and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:05:00.050" style="s2">Berkeley was also simultaneously going</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.639" end="00:05:02.630" style="s2">through the very first first appearance</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.050" end="00:05:04.580" style="s2">of a really strong women&#39;s movement was</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.630" end="00:05:07.190" style="s2">probably the place where it was coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.580" end="00:05:10.729" style="s2">forth the strongest and that was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.190" end="00:05:12.440" style="s2">challenging you know also like because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.729" end="00:05:15.260" style="s2">never thought about objectifying women</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.440" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">or any of the things that was just how</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.260" end="00:05:21.169" style="s2">it was you know and then suddenly there</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.630" end="00:05:24.229" style="s2">was like thousands of women in Berkeley</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.169" end="00:05:28.849" style="s2">who were coming together in getting very</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.229" end="00:05:34.039" style="s2">angry and I was just lost with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.849" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">thing but fortunately there was also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.039" end="00:05:40.669" style="s2">kind of cutting edge of new therapies</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">and in her work that was happening and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.669" end="00:05:48.500" style="s2">out of desperation and necessity I found</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:50.539" style="s2">myself in my very first group which</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:54.289" style="s2">happened to be a men&#39;s group immense</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.539" end="00:05:57.020" style="s2">encounter bioenergetic group and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.289" end="00:05:59.720" style="s2">in about 20 minutes because it tossed me</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.020" end="00:06:03.349" style="s2">into the middle of the room and started</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:06.020" style="s2">provoking me because I had no access to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.349" end="00:06:09.349" style="s2">my anger and that was what was driving</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.020" end="00:06:11.470" style="s2">me crazy and I got him both with living</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.349" end="00:06:13.880" style="s2">together with a group of men who</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.470" end="00:06:17.060" style="s2">identified themselves we identified</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.880" end="00:06:19.880" style="s2">ourselves as feminists it was we were so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.060" end="00:06:22.070" style="s2">we and we created a min Center and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.880" end="00:06:23.550" style="s2">had a men&#39;s radio talk show to talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.070" end="00:06:25.980" style="s2">about men&#39;s issues</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.550" end="00:06:28.500" style="s2">but and there were all in response to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.980" end="00:06:31.740" style="s2">the challenges that were coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.500" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">feminists and basically literally we</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.740" end="00:06:40.910" style="s2">were caught with our pants down feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:45.050" style="s2">very guilty and apologetic and castrated</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.910" end="00:06:50.700" style="s2">like we&#39;re wrong and I remember one day</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.050" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">in in a meeting just not connecting with</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.700" end="00:06:54.990" style="s2">the words everybody was saying and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:57.420" style="s2">having this kind of almost like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.990" end="00:07:00.270" style="s2">out-of-body experience in a way where I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.420" end="00:07:02.580" style="s2">felt like I could just see all of us men</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.270" end="00:07:08.760" style="s2">and I had this vision that we were all</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:11.490" style="s2">sitting there sawing off our balls and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.760" end="00:07:15.300" style="s2">was like shocked by it and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.490" end="00:07:17.550" style="s2">and I realized in that moment that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.300" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to it wasn&#39;t going to free</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.550" end="00:07:24.630" style="s2">me you know and I about after seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:27.060" style="s2">no woman pardon nor the women that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.630" end="00:07:28.650" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an answer and I didn&#39;t feel all</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.060" end="00:07:32.270" style="s2">of a sudden I felt separate from that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.650" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">group that I felt very connected to and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.270" end="00:07:39.600" style="s2">about 15 minutes later I stood up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.670" style="s2">resigned from the group and I just said</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.600" end="00:07:44.370" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on here and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.670" end="00:07:46.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t name it as castration I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.370" end="00:07:49.140" style="s2">understand that really even at that time</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.470" end="00:07:51.480" style="s2">I didn&#39;t name it as guilt but I saw it</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.140" end="00:07:53.970" style="s2">as guilt and I saw it being turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.480" end="00:07:58.590" style="s2">everybody was turning against themselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.970" end="00:08:00.570" style="s2">were so wrong we&#39;re so bad and I got up</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.590" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">and I walked out and I went out to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.570" end="00:08:07.410" style="s2">dinner with my mother and I can&#39;t became</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.530" end="00:08:10.050" style="s2">so interested in this subject or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.410" end="00:08:12.480" style="s2">healing of Matt of the masculine and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.050" end="00:08:14.280" style="s2">healing of the feminine that I became a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.480" end="00:08:17.010" style="s2">therapist and it became one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.280" end="00:08:20.970" style="s2">subjects that I specialized in and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.010" end="00:08:23.640" style="s2">still lead workshops and trainings with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.970" end="00:08:27.300" style="s2">that and it&#39;s so so it&#39;s the works I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.640" end="00:08:29.060" style="s2">have a big passion for and even so after</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.300" end="00:08:33.790" style="s2">all those years</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.060" end="00:08:36.310" style="s2">your words were like something I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.790" end="00:08:39.640" style="s2">before or even allowed myself to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.310" end="00:08:43.540" style="s2">actually conceive of so it was also a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.640" end="00:08:47.170" style="s2">kind of waking up moment for me and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.540" end="00:08:49.240" style="s2">then was me too coming out and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.170" end="00:08:52.060" style="s2">that anger coming out and having my own</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.240" end="00:08:55.060" style="s2">history of realizing how my empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.060" end="00:08:57.460" style="s2">came by really getting in touch with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.060" end="00:09:05.560" style="s2">anger and letting it come out there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.460" end="00:09:10.780" style="s2">a big Bravo yes you know about it and at</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.560" end="00:09:13.840" style="s2">the same time I think that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.780" end="00:09:16.290" style="s2">come out of the blame culture you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.840" end="00:09:18.850" style="s2">and we need to come into the responsible</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.290" end="00:09:20.590" style="s2">culture and just a little bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.850" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">that we spent together in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.590" end="00:09:25.450" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking and everything just</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:27.550" style="s2">feels like yes this is the real</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.450" end="00:09:32.830" style="s2">conversation between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.550" end="00:09:35.260" style="s2">hasn&#39;t happened yet and I hope that as</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.830" end="00:09:37.090" style="s2">part of our learning where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.260" end="00:09:39.280" style="s2">learning from each other as we talk and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.090" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">that we&#39;re still in that and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.280" end="00:09:45.310" style="s2">want to posture myself as somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:48.760" style="s2">has all the answers I don&#39;t it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.310" end="00:09:50.500" style="s2">it&#39;s still a process of Revelation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.760" end="00:09:55.000" style="s2">learning it&#39;s so interesting I just need</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.500" end="00:09:58.330" style="s2">to catch that need to stop the blaming</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.000" end="00:10:00.100" style="s2">and when I was listening to your story I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.330" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">immediately thought yes and also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">safe blaming we need to stop the blaming</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:08.340" style="s2">over there and also the safe self</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">blaming and in your story you shared how</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.340" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been experiencing in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:16.870" style="s2">man groups group back then was not so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:18.790" style="s2">much okay did we take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.870" end="00:10:23.380" style="s2">our shadow it was self blaming and going</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.790" end="00:10:27.190" style="s2">into guilt and that&#39;s what we women can</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.380" end="00:10:30.400" style="s2">do very well as well and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.190" end="00:10:32.170" style="s2">some women out there who have seen the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.400" end="00:10:34.840" style="s2">film are afraid that that&#39;s what we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.170" end="00:10:36.490" style="s2">doing another round of self blaming okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.840" end="00:10:39.630" style="s2">now it&#39;s not blaming now itself blaming</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.490" end="00:10:43.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s not we don&#39;t have a Hydra of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:46.630" style="s2">saying sorry for what happened out of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.330" end="00:10:47.470" style="s2">place of greatness we always learn how</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.630" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">to apologize</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.470" end="00:10:51.970" style="s2">from a place of smallness and small</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:54.220" style="s2">people won&#39;t save the earth they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.970" end="00:10:56.950" style="s2">be happy they won&#39;t contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.220" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">anything I have to have this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.950" end="00:11:02.680" style="s2">courage of loving myself with all those</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:06.220" style="s2">shadows yeah and it&#39;s when we stop out</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.680" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">of this thing of guilt and fault and go</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.220" end="00:11:10.060" style="s2">into just taking responsibility that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:12.760" style="s2">start to be curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.060" end="00:11:16.690" style="s2">conversation yeah it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.760" end="00:11:18.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a big phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.690" end="00:11:20.110" style="s2">became quite popular in the 60s through</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.460" end="00:11:23.320" style="s2">the through the women&#39;s movement was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.110" end="00:11:24.490" style="s2">personal is political and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.320" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">interesting is your film is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.490" end="00:11:31.210" style="s2">personal very very personal but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:34.740" style="s2">also putting a finger on one of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.210" end="00:11:37.240" style="s2">of the real source points on the culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.740" end="00:11:39.190" style="s2">especially coming so soon after me to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.240" end="00:11:43.090" style="s2">the site have kind of so many women</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.190" end="00:11:45.190" style="s2">owning their stuff even I I have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.090" end="00:11:46.810" style="s2">admit when I watched the film when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.190" end="00:11:48.280" style="s2">watched the poem first time you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.810" end="00:11:50.890" style="s2">delivered it I was immensely touched by</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:52.210" style="s2">it and I have felt touched by it when</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.890" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched it but I&#39;ve also watched it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.210" end="00:11:58.260" style="s2">and felt wow this is so countercultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:00.970" style="s2">for want of a better word it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.260" end="00:12:03.190" style="s2">opposite to the narrative that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.970" end="00:12:05.140" style="s2">we&#39;re in as a culture right now that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.190" end="00:12:07.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve that I&#39;ve also felt wow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.140" end="00:12:08.890" style="s2">unbalanced and I do feel that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.150" end="00:12:11.410" style="s2">unbalanced in some way because it has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.890" end="00:12:13.540" style="s2">be matched by a similar ownership from</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.410" end="00:12:15.640" style="s2">the other side certain parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.540" end="00:12:18.310" style="s2">media I would say at the moment of very</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.640" end="00:12:19.810" style="s2">have a very ideological perspective a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.310" end="00:12:23.020" style="s2">very sort of feminist ideological</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.810" end="00:12:26.380" style="s2">perspective and online there is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.020" end="00:12:28.690" style="s2">of growing anti feminist movement I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.380" end="00:12:30.610" style="s2">sort of you saw with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.690" end="00:12:32.200" style="s2">comments on YouTube especially and there</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.610" end="00:12:36.250" style="s2">is a growing kind of they call the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.200" end="00:12:40.120" style="s2">manosphere online and there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.250" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2">any any sign of men kind of owning their</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.120" end="00:12:45.160" style="s2">stuff is seen as apologetic it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.850" end="00:12:47.380" style="s2">and it can be kind of if it&#39;s done from</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.160" end="00:12:49.330" style="s2">a place of guilt it can be this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:51.190" style="s2">self castration it can be this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.330" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">self negation and I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.190" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">interesting is can you have ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:58.510" style="s2">how we are contributing to the division</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:00.430" style="s2">between men and women without slipping</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.510" end="00:13:03.180" style="s2">into self-hatred without so</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.430" end="00:13:07.030" style="s2">into castration without slipping into</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.180" end="00:13:11.830" style="s2">apologetic I think that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.030" end="00:13:15.130" style="s2">I find yet that that rebalances the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.830" end="00:13:18.430" style="s2">film kind of the ownership of a vast off</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.130" end="00:13:22.270" style="s2">as men I think it is very possible I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.430" end="00:13:24.130" style="s2">think rather than you know going</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.270" end="00:13:26.920" style="s2">together can be these self revelation</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.130" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">and revelation we expands you and makes</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.920" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">you happy and and as you pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:36.520" style="s2">anything it is empowering you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">like my shadow will play out negatively</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.520" end="00:13:41.260" style="s2">as long as I try to keep it in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:42.940" style="s2">closet and it will distort my life it</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.260" end="00:13:44.650" style="s2">will bring unhappiness to me and it will</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.940" end="00:13:48.310" style="s2">bring unhappiness to the people around</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.650" end="00:13:50.350" style="s2">me and it will perpetuate the need then</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.310" end="00:13:52.180" style="s2">to blame other people for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.350" end="00:13:54.940" style="s2">consequences of the ways that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.180" end="00:13:57.880" style="s2">played out so to me it&#39;s very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.940" end="00:14:00.310" style="s2">truth it&#39;s still a difficult one because</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.880" end="00:14:02.200" style="s2">the shadow is in the shadow it means</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.310" end="00:14:04.750" style="s2">it&#39;s hidden it means it&#39;s not the parent</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.200" end="00:14:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not totally obvious you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.750" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know if when it ends you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.840" end="00:14:14.980" style="s2">when the win the self-discovery process</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:17.050" style="s2">ends but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s been with me</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.980" end="00:14:20.380" style="s2">for quite a while that understanding</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.900" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">a very big key that especially men in</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.720" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">our fast food culture don&#39;t learn they</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:24.110" style="s2">deserve time for learning because this</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:25.640" style="s2">is deep stuff it&#39;s not something that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.110" end="00:18:28.970" style="s2">can buy it&#39;s not something that anybody</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.970" end="00:18:35.750" style="s2">guilt that I have to unravel the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.580" end="00:18:39.140" style="s2">and I think then and this is when you</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.140" end="00:18:44.630" style="s2">to apologize and it reached me what me</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:48.260" style="s2">reached is something so touching because</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.630" end="00:18:52.070" style="s2">I experienced it so so little from men</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.260" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">in our days they say sorry and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.070" end="00:18:56.750" style="s2">don&#39;t need me they don&#39;t need my</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.490" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">because you learned it yesterday but</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.530" end="00:19:13.820" style="s2">because you started studying at 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">ago and I just want to say thank you for</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.140" end="00:19:26.390" style="s2">collective what I experienced is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.750" end="00:19:29.419" style="s2">something that really matters to me and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.390" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">I think this is something that I might</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.419" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">say to many women in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:36.140" style="s2">thank you something more that I could</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">feel I could feel the relaxation in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.140" end="00:19:42.289" style="s2">nervous system when you were just saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:47.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the truth and in allowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.289" end="00:19:49.160" style="s2">yourself to say I cannot say into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.090" end="00:19:52.940" style="s2">camera that is all heal now I&#39;m clean</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.160" end="00:19:55.429" style="s2">now I&#39;m continuously doing this work and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.940" end="00:19:56.350" style="s2">owning and trying to be as honest as I</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.429" end="00:20:00.590" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.350" end="00:20:08.210" style="s2">gives me the allowance to be allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.590" end="00:20:12.110" style="s2">learn to and I want to learn to be more</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.210" end="00:20:14.210" style="s2">and more and more clear with my truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.110" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">and my boundaries instead of going into</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.210" end="00:20:20.419" style="s2">the seduction and manipulation games we</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:22.010" style="s2">have learned and I cannot promise that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.419" end="00:20:25.159" style="s2">will do in every moment and I will not</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:29.030" style="s2">step back into it in moments and thus I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.159" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">do understand a Stan man&#39;s mistrust I do</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.030" end="00:20:34.940" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s not easy to trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:38.690" style="s2">as women I do understand and I even</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.940" end="00:20:42.169" style="s2">can&#39;t say me honestly me you can trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.690" end="00:20:44.150" style="s2">always I can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.169" end="00:20:45.860" style="s2">sometimes I can&#39;t even trust myself and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.150" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really important that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.860" end="00:20:52.730" style="s2">acknowledge that it&#39;s part of a learning</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:54.620" style="s2">curve and you can&#39;t see further ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.730" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">the learning curve than where you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.620" end="00:21:01.010" style="s2">right now but that you recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:02.929" style="s2">history of it and who knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.010" end="00:21:05.419" style="s2">next challenges are going to be one</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.929" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">thing I definitely realize is that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.419" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">the moment where we just decide and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:17.780" style="s2">commit both to wanting to learn owning</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:22.130" style="s2">that we make mistakes that we fall back</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.780" end="00:21:24.200" style="s2">and that we are curious about finding</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.130" end="00:21:26.870" style="s2">out what it is what what is acting out</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.200" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">what are we doing when I feel that both</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.870" end="00:21:32.120" style="s2">sides are curious about it then I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:34.370" style="s2">start to become really alive and really</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.120" end="00:21:35.750" style="s2">interested and really interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.370" end="00:21:38.690" style="s2">relation and really interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.750" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">dialogue in the conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:43.730" style="s2">interesting comparing two to you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:47.870" style="s2">we&#39;re from different generations yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.730" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2">and I was raised by a very feminist</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.870" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">family by a feminist mother a FEMINIST</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">father and my I think the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:22:02.510" style="s2">that I&#39;ve behaved in relationships has</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:04.990" style="s2">been much more holding myself back and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.510" end="00:22:08.570" style="s2">the lying has been a kind of lie of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.990" end="00:22:10.250" style="s2">omission all the time it&#39;s been not</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.570" end="00:22:12.830" style="s2">fully showing up not fully telling the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.250" end="00:22:14.360" style="s2">truth not kind of taking on this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.830" end="00:22:19.669" style="s2">feeling of I&#39;m completely responsible</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.360" end="00:22:21.080" style="s2">for the way that my partner feels so not</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.669" end="00:22:24.220" style="s2">being honest about the way I was feeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.080" end="00:22:26.990" style="s2">and stringing stringing women along of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.220" end="00:22:28.850" style="s2">kind of internalizing this this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.990" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">of I&#39;m completely responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.850" end="00:22:33.950" style="s2">everything that they feel and then not</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.150" style="s2">really being honest and being in</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.950" end="00:22:36.860" style="s2">relationships for longer than I should</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.150" end="00:22:38.659" style="s2">be and not being honest about what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.860" end="00:22:40.940" style="s2">feeling so when I look at the me to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.659" end="00:22:43.010" style="s2">movement and that it&#39;s a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.940" end="00:22:47.659" style="s2">men the moments like men acting out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.010" end="00:22:49.429" style="s2">being sexually predatory I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.659" end="00:22:51.620" style="s2">experience that I don&#39;t think that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.429" end="00:22:54.380" style="s2">my stuff and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.620" end="00:22:55.640" style="s2">of guys from from my generation stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.380" end="00:22:57.530" style="s2">and a lot of them were actually brought</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.640" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">up in a different environment and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.530" end="00:23:01.669" style="s2">of it was feeling a sense of shame</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.690" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">around themselves as men and not fully</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.669" end="00:23:05.659" style="s2">showing up for that reason at least that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">is something that I have started to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.659" end="00:23:15.290" style="s2">experience and in my work with my</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:17.419" style="s2">client&#39;s etc etc that as I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.290" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2">beginning in the moment where I started</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.419" end="00:23:25.190" style="s2">to be interested in my shadow and when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:27.350" style="s2">started to feel more empowered and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.190" end="00:23:29.929" style="s2">loving towards myself I started to feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.350" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">really compassion for the role I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.929" end="00:23:37.659" style="s2">see wow it has to be difficult to grow</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:43.780" style="s2">up as a boy and to become a man nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.659" end="00:23:47.060" style="s2">because the narrative of men are</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.780" end="00:23:50.460" style="s2">perpetrators men are violators men are</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.060" end="00:23:52.440" style="s2">abusers is so huge and out of good</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.460" end="00:23:56.190" style="s2">reasons of course it&#39;s the this does not</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.440" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">come out of nothing but no man is born</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.190" end="00:24:03.750" style="s2">as a abuser and other aggressor and has</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:06.750" style="s2">a problem it oh it&#39;s a biological</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.750" end="00:24:09.240" style="s2">problem so yes and you get born and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.750" end="00:24:11.160" style="s2">you&#39;d grow up with these images of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.240" end="00:24:12.900" style="s2">manhood and I think this is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.160" end="00:24:16.200" style="s2">that raffia talks about really well that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.900" end="00:24:18.870" style="s2">if as a man you grow up feeling that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.200" end="00:24:20.760" style="s2">then suppress a lot of the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.870" end="00:24:23.910" style="s2">natural aggression or the natural kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.760" end="00:24:25.320" style="s2">of feelings you you don&#39;t you you very</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.910" end="00:24:27.540" style="s2">much don&#39;t want to be like those other</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.320" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">guys and actually that leads to a sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.540" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">of shadow of perverted aggression so</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">when we hear the word aggression and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:40.560" style="s2">male aggression we think about men</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:41.910" style="s2">taking their gun or taking the penis and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.560" end="00:24:45.540" style="s2">raping woman and I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.910" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">perverted expressions of an aggression</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.540" end="00:24:50.790" style="s2">that the men had to suppress before it</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:53.310" style="s2">got into this form so even though our</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.790" end="00:24:54.900" style="s2">language is very it&#39;s it&#39;s very subtle</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.310" end="00:24:57.180" style="s2">what what we are looking for in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.900" end="00:24:59.490" style="s2">first place is an instinctual anger of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.180" end="00:25:02.280" style="s2">protecting boundaries and that&#39;s for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.490" end="00:25:04.170" style="s2">sake of peace and for the sake of war</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.280" end="00:25:06.030" style="s2">between the sexes so yeah and that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.170" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">interesting the way you say that because</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.030" end="00:25:11.790" style="s2">what I work with a lot of times with men</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:14.730" style="s2">is that they they have rejected a side</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.790" end="00:25:16.440" style="s2">of their own masculinity like the roots</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.730" end="00:25:19.860" style="s2">of their investment because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.440" end="00:25:22.560" style="s2">be like anything but like all those guys</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.860" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">who they see as responsible for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.560" end="00:25:28.560" style="s2">problems and so they and and they think</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:31.410" style="s2">that that&#39;s a level of aggression and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.560" end="00:25:34.890" style="s2">violence and sexual abuse and so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.410" end="00:25:37.830" style="s2">repress that side and of course then it</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.890" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">gets acted out it comes out and all</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.830" end="00:25:42.990" style="s2">kinds of things and a lot of times what</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:46.440" style="s2">I&#39;m doing in groups with men is getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.990" end="00:25:48.690" style="s2">men to go in and really feel that layer</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.440" end="00:25:52.170" style="s2">of the masculine whether is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.690" end="00:25:55.260" style="s2">aggression and frustration and anger and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.170" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">hatred and encourage them to just allow</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.260" end="00:25:59.720" style="s2">it to come out and rather than that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:02.180" style="s2">overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.720" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">their personality like they&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.180" end="00:26:07.250" style="s2">and then becoming that way they find</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:09.530" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually not that much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.250" end="00:26:10.730" style="s2">like it&#39;s a lair but as long as you deny</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.530" end="00:26:13.400" style="s2">that lair</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.730" end="00:26:16.580" style="s2">you know you you lose your roots and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.400" end="00:26:19.970" style="s2">lose your instinctive connection to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.580" end="00:26:23.270" style="s2">masculinity and into the truth that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.970" end="00:26:25.910" style="s2">could express in your sexuality you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.270" end="00:26:27.860" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a big part of flick the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.910" end="00:26:30.950" style="s2">men&#39;s work I do is to get men to go into</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.860" end="00:26:33.260" style="s2">that culture creates the specific male</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.950" end="00:26:35.660" style="s2">shadow of aggression and it&#39;s like every</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.260" end="00:26:38.540" style="s2">shadow of the thing is this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.660" end="00:26:40.910" style="s2">healthy and it&#39;s good but a shadow is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.540" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">monster and then you say you want me</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.910" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">touching this monster no way you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:48.560" style="s2">honey trust me I&#39;m doing this for 40</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:50.810" style="s2">years it&#39;s worth it every time I do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.560" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">and then you say hey come on I see I</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.810" end="00:26:55.190" style="s2">think every also with female rage I</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:58.070" style="s2">think this is not that big difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.190" end="00:27:01.250" style="s2">whenever I go really infrared and really</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.070" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">enter and guide stay with my body I find</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.250" end="00:27:07.610" style="s2">myself to be the most peaceful being on</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:10.460" style="s2">earth the last thing that I plant I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.610" end="00:27:15.800" style="s2">plan to somehow survive this wave of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.460" end="00:27:18.160" style="s2">rage and then wow I&#39;m okay you okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.800" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">quite a shock how positive it is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.160" end="00:27:22.520" style="s2">discharge suppressed aggression because</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:25.040" style="s2">this because this thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.520" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">repressed or the repressed aggression</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.040" end="00:27:29.930" style="s2">which then as any any shadow does then</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:32.090" style="s2">plays out I think is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.930" end="00:27:34.280" style="s2">unspoken dynamic behind a lot of the me</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.090" end="00:27:36.230" style="s2">to stuff that we&#39;ve seen because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.280" end="00:27:41.030" style="s2">it&#39;s come out that a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.230" end="00:27:43.280" style="s2">who were accused of acting out in ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.030" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">during me to identify themselves as male</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.280" end="00:27:48.710" style="s2">feminists they identified themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:50.300" style="s2">not those kind of guys and if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.710" end="00:27:52.550" style="s2">identify yourself as I&#39;m not that kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.300" end="00:27:54.110" style="s2">of guy then you&#39;re suppressing this</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.550" end="00:27:57.620" style="s2">thing and it comes out sideways</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.110" end="00:28:00.230" style="s2">and I think this is this is part of on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.620" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">cultural level I think unless we realize</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.230" end="00:28:04.040" style="s2">this that actually we need to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:07.670" style="s2">men to embrace their masculinity to live</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.040" end="00:28:09.710" style="s2">that out to be in in a full way then</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.670" end="00:28:11.330" style="s2">they are discharging it they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.710" end="00:28:11.940" style="s2">pushing it down into the cellar and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.330" end="00:28:13.710" style="s2">it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.940" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">sideways and I think as a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.710" end="00:28:16.860" style="s2">we&#39;re actually probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.929" style="s2">encourage more of that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.860" end="00:28:20.460" style="s2">because we&#39;re teaching men to be ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.929" end="00:28:23.669" style="s2">of their sexuality we&#39;re teaching men to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.460" end="00:28:26.490" style="s2">be ashamed of their masculine aggression</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.669" end="00:28:28.350" style="s2">I think that&#39;s actually going to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.490" end="00:28:30.899" style="s2">the the the reverse effect to the one</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.350" end="00:28:34.110" style="s2">that we think and I want to add that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.899" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">when a group of men go through that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.110" end="00:28:39.330" style="s2">it&#39;s something I would try and bring in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:41.549" style="s2">rather early in a men&#39;s group they come</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.330" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">into a relaxation and like you said</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.549" end="00:28:48.750" style="s2">peacefulness and and this thing of male</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">bonding becomes very real a support for</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.750" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">each other and a love and a kindness</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:58.350" style="s2">and and and the almost the cessation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:29:01.320" style="s2">a certain kind of competition that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.350" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">there when somebody feels castrated or</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.320" end="00:29:04.500" style="s2">when somebody is not empowered and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.299" style="s2">they&#39;re always having to prove</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.500" end="00:29:08.190" style="s2">themselves and they come in as brothers</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.299" end="00:29:10.409" style="s2">and support and it&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.190" end="00:29:13.590" style="s2">beautiful things that happens in men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.409" end="00:29:16.620" style="s2">group it isn&#39;t that they arrive okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.590" end="00:29:19.350" style="s2">this is home and I&#39;m a I&#39;m a beast I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.620" end="00:29:22.710" style="s2">rapist I&#39;m a killer I&#39;m I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.350" end="00:29:25.139" style="s2">quite the opposite they go oh god I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.710" end="00:29:26.909" style="s2">so good and I love being a man and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.139" end="00:29:28.500" style="s2">and they can feel their legs and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.909" end="00:29:31.860" style="s2">can feel their balls and they can feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.500" end="00:29:35.720" style="s2">that kind of connection and it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.860" end="00:29:38.250" style="s2">of simple healing in fact of all of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.720" end="00:29:41.519" style="s2">tremendous amount of what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.250" end="00:29:46.289" style="s2">absorbed from the culture which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.519" end="00:29:49.409" style="s2">making masculinity so toxic and and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.289" end="00:29:52.200" style="s2">want to say that it that it&#39;s also right</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.409" end="00:29:53.909" style="s2">to really challenge the masculinity in</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.200" end="00:29:56.070" style="s2">the way that it acts out with the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.909" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">that acts out when this when a man is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.070" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">castrated and when he hasn&#39;t owned as</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">part of himself he really is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:08.039" style="s2">monster and I think the big</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">misunderstanding collectively is that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.039" end="00:30:15.509" style="s2">mistake this expression of distorted</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:18.179" style="s2">castrated masculinity as masculinity so</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.509" end="00:30:22.019" style="s2">many when I listen to many feminist</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.179" end="00:30:23.470" style="s2">women not all of them of course many it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.019" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">sounds as if</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.470" end="00:30:30.070" style="s2">that was the essence of masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:31.960" style="s2">thus we have to fight it and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.070" end="00:30:35.830" style="s2">huge misunderstanding because this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:40.150" style="s2">not natural masculinity these is already</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.830" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">coming out of this castration of losing</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.150" end="00:30:46.539" style="s2">access to natural masculinity and also</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:50.289" style="s2">same as for for as women to you to to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.539" end="00:30:52.750" style="s2">natural power I think both femininity I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.289" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">was so turned off of being a woman when</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.750" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">I thought what the sky tree offers me as</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:31:01.059" style="s2">typical feminine it&#39;s it&#39;s the loser cut</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:03.460" style="s2">who who should want to have tits nobody</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.059" end="00:31:06.400" style="s2">on earth it&#39;s just being being the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.460" end="00:31:09.549" style="s2">secondary class of human beings and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.400" end="00:31:12.400" style="s2">when I started to question is this right</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.549" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">or am i right and have every right on</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.400" end="00:31:16.900" style="s2">earth to unravel my kind of femininity I</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">became curious and I think this is so</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.900" end="00:31:21.100" style="s2">important for men truth they want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:24.520" style="s2">gain back their masculine essence and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.100" end="00:31:27.190" style="s2">they have to be curious about what comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.520" end="00:31:30.010" style="s2">up in themselves when they allow to set</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.190" end="00:31:32.230" style="s2">boundaries to this conditioning or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.010" end="00:31:34.630" style="s2">cultural imprint what masculinity means</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.230" end="00:31:36.850" style="s2">so it&#39;s almost like we need true words</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.630" end="00:31:39.100" style="s2">we need are we talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.850" end="00:31:41.320" style="s2">masculinity or the true masculinity of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.100" end="00:31:43.720" style="s2">boy psychology and man psychology a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.320" end="00:31:46.750" style="s2">of people divide it into that so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.720" end="00:31:49.240" style="s2">of what people are protesting against or</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.750" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">attacking is boy psychology rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.240" end="00:31:57.220" style="s2">man psychology it&#39;s not fully and in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:32:00.070" style="s2">both cases I think like a real rite of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.220" end="00:32:02.530" style="s2">passage at the time of life when were</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.070" end="00:32:06.549" style="s2">coming into puberty were you&#39;re welcomed</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.530" end="00:32:09.100" style="s2">into the feminine and into womanhood and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.549" end="00:32:11.830" style="s2">you&#39;re the secrets and mysteries of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.100" end="00:32:14.590" style="s2">are revealed to you by elder women and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.830" end="00:32:18.920" style="s2">the same for men my life would have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.590" end="00:32:21.530" style="s2">different God if I had if I had gotten</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.920" end="00:32:23.390" style="s2">the teaching in that way of what it what</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.530" end="00:32:26.270" style="s2">does it mean and I felt included and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.390" end="00:32:30.230" style="s2">felt the support I felt like a group of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.270" end="00:32:32.780" style="s2">men or just even my father you know had</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.230" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">my back come were there for me you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.780" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">it would have changed everything you</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:44.540" style="s2">know I just I was so I really the amount</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:47.390" style="s2">of suffering and and pain and loss and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.540" end="00:32:49.850" style="s2">being alone with it and just completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.390" end="00:32:51.740" style="s2">confused I would like to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.850" end="00:32:52.940" style="s2">what you have been sharing because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.740" end="00:32:54.500" style="s2">think it&#39;s really interesting you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.940" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">been sharing that your personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.500" end="00:32:59.090" style="s2">experience is quite different in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:04.160" style="s2">different generation it has not been as</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.090" end="00:33:07.670" style="s2">much conditioning let&#39;s say of women are</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.160" end="00:33:10.850" style="s2">objects has more been you have to care</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.670" end="00:33:12.950" style="s2">for women from women&#39;s emotion for you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.850" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">are responsible or let&#39;s say guilty when</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.950" end="00:33:20.030" style="s2">a woman feels bad this kind of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:24.500" style="s2">I imagine that this brings along a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.030" end="00:33:27.650" style="s2">of holding back of own needs wishes</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.500" end="00:33:30.620" style="s2">whatever truthful and that this can</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.650" end="00:33:35.030" style="s2">bring a lot of rage to I&#39;m curious I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.620" end="00:33:36.590" style="s2">curious to hear about you is there right</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.030" end="00:33:37.460" style="s2">about that understand what what is your</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.590" end="00:33:41.150" style="s2">experience with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.460" end="00:33:43.430" style="s2">well yeah I don&#39;t know how much of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.150" end="00:33:47.300" style="s2">is particular to my upbringing because</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.430" end="00:33:50.210" style="s2">my mother was often depressed and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.300" end="00:33:51.590" style="s2">think a lot of children take on if they</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.210" end="00:33:53.750" style="s2">have a depressed parent that it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.590" end="00:33:58.430" style="s2">fault so a lot of that could be tied in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.750" end="00:33:59.570" style="s2">with it as well but I also know from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.430" end="00:34:01.130" style="s2">inner work that I&#39;ve done and I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.570" end="00:34:02.780" style="s2">you&#39;ve done a lot of inner work as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.130" end="00:34:05.060" style="s2">if you dig down</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.780" end="00:34:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;s almost universal that you have some</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.060" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">kind of anger towards your parents you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.520" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">were in this kind of very you you you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.100" style="s2">pretty much you all of your emotions you</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:15.410" style="s2">you kind of put onto your parents they</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.100" end="00:34:16.790" style="s2">were the world and they never they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.410" end="00:34:17.900" style="s2">they were there they weren&#39;t there and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.790" end="00:34:19.610" style="s2">when they weren&#39;t there we all have this</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.900" end="00:34:22.550" style="s2">kind of infantile rage I think we all</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.610" end="00:34:24.650" style="s2">have on some level inside us and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.550" end="00:34:25.210" style="s2">getting that out in some way is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.650" end="00:34:27.970" style="s2">an essential</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.210" end="00:34:31.990" style="s2">part of of getting more healthy as a as</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.970" end="00:34:34.210" style="s2">an adult but also going into that kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.990" end="00:34:36.129" style="s2">of inner work what I found really</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.210" end="00:34:38.919" style="s2">interesting was how much more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.129" end="00:34:40.540" style="s2">it is to identify the mother stuff than</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.919" end="00:34:43.419" style="s2">it is to identify the father stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.540" end="00:34:44.830" style="s2">often and I&#39;ve seen it with other people</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.419" end="00:34:46.869" style="s2">in these kind of processes as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.830" end="00:34:48.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s quite easy sometimes to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.869" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">what my father did this my father did</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.940" end="00:34:53.800" style="s2">that he was there he wasn&#39;t there he was</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">an alcoholic it was whatever and you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.800" end="00:34:58.150" style="s2">kind of quite easily identify and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:35:00.609" style="s2">seems much more easy to process whereas</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.150" end="00:35:03.070" style="s2">the mother stuff I found far more</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.609" end="00:35:05.020" style="s2">difficult to see I&#39;m far more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.070" end="00:35:07.180" style="s2">to clear because a lot of the time it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.020" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">comes with these sort of feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.180" end="00:35:12.220" style="s2">what it would be so wrong to feel angry</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:13.980" style="s2">towards your mother it would be so bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.220" end="00:35:18.010" style="s2">to feel that towards your mother and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.980" end="00:35:19.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;ve seen yeah I certainly for</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.010" end="00:35:21.790" style="s2">myself I found it much more difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.750" end="00:35:24.420" style="s2">see you identify it and then to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.790" end="00:35:26.980" style="s2">work with it than with the father stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.420" end="00:35:29.890" style="s2">you just touched something though that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.980" end="00:35:32.980" style="s2">think for myself personally and I see it</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.890" end="00:35:36.940" style="s2">with other men ties the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.980" end="00:35:44.230" style="s2">mother and lack of power and the men</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.940" end="00:35:47.560" style="s2">together and that has been this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.230" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">that you&#39;re become very very sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.560" end="00:35:53.950" style="s2">to your mother&#39;s feelings and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:57.910" style="s2">changes of mood and whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.950" end="00:36:00.940" style="s2">happening in the house and it creates a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.910" end="00:36:03.820" style="s2">kind of pleaser mentality in a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.940" end="00:36:06.339" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to damage control women</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.820" end="00:36:09.070" style="s2">and I&#39;ve noticed in my relationships I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.339" end="00:36:11.380" style="s2">carry that sensitivity it&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.070" end="00:36:13.450" style="s2">mother was mostly really quite a bright</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.380" end="00:36:17.230" style="s2">and happy person but when she would go</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.450" end="00:36:20.470" style="s2">you&#39;d feel the air change you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.230" end="00:36:23.230" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on and then I I</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.470" end="00:36:24.940" style="s2">see myself getting activated in a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:28.900" style="s2">that I become a pleaser</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.940" end="00:36:30.430" style="s2">it&#39;s then what can I do in order and bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.900" end="00:36:34.150" style="s2">underneath it I&#39;m trying to change her</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.690" end="00:36:40.660" style="s2">brings</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.470" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">and I know it from my own experience and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.660" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">I see it mother thinks it brings out the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:46.599" style="s2">contempt of the woman because the women</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:51.130" style="s2">hate because I become regressing to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.599" end="00:36:54.280" style="s2">boy in that moment I&#39;m afraid basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.130" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">of the feminine feelings and that may be</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.280" end="00:36:58.330" style="s2">some kind of negativity is gonna come up</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.929" end="00:39:01.289" style="s2">of the complexity of the relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.789" end="00:39:04.140" style="s2">the mother because the mother was</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.289" end="00:39:52.469" style="s2">a kid but I&#39;ve somehow to confront that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.989" end="00:39:55.799" style="s2">place as a man and see it and then say</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.469" end="00:39:57.179" style="s2">what I really feel you know instead of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.799" end="00:39:59.549" style="s2">trying to manipulate because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.179" end="00:40:01.529" style="s2">where the manipulation goes in and just</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.549" end="00:40:04.229" style="s2">come out and ask really straight hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.529" end="00:40:07.019" style="s2">what&#39;s going on right now you know and</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.229" end="00:40:10.709" style="s2">be there and be present and grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.019" end="00:40:13.380" style="s2">in in the mask on and recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.709" end="00:40:16.919" style="s2">something&#39;s happening and not be in</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.380" end="00:40:19.650" style="s2">trying to fix it or be in judgment of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.919" end="00:40:21.569" style="s2">but be actually really curious does that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.650" end="00:40:23.640" style="s2">work Kirsten I&#39;m really curious what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.569" end="00:40:25.259" style="s2">going on right now and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.640" end="00:40:29.279" style="s2">interesting for me it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.259" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">to hear and to realize how this having</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.279" end="00:40:34.499" style="s2">learned that somehow manipulate the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:38.909" style="s2">situation and the other person is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.499" end="00:40:42.299" style="s2">only way to damage control or to is</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.909" end="00:40:45.630" style="s2">mutual is because we as girls have</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.299" end="00:40:48.230" style="s2">learned that from our mother to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.630" end="00:40:50.150" style="s2">slightly different reasons I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.230" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">for myself and I know this is true for</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.150" end="00:40:56.270" style="s2">many women I know that we have not</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">learned from our mothers that a girl and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.270" end="00:41:01.310" style="s2">a woman can have clear boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.869" style="s2">say what she thinks and what she means</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.310" end="00:41:05.570" style="s2">and say no and stand up for what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.869" end="00:41:07.580" style="s2">right for me I have not learned that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.570" end="00:41:10.190" style="s2">had no role model for that it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.580" end="00:41:10.760" style="s2">now trying to make it right for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.190" end="00:41:13.340" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.760" end="00:41:15.880" style="s2">and in order to get it at least a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.340" end="00:41:20.450" style="s2">bit right for yourself to manipulate and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.880" end="00:41:22.700" style="s2">it&#39;s always trying to find safety by</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.450" end="00:41:25.640" style="s2">going through the outer world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.700" end="00:41:27.080" style="s2">always the wrong first step I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.640" end="00:41:29.630" style="s2">safe with myself and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.080" end="00:41:31.850" style="s2">also an insight where it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.630" end="00:41:33.800" style="s2">really 10 deaths at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.850" end="00:41:35.720" style="s2">like somebody asks me what do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.800" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">and I try to train it what does you want</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.720" end="00:41:41.060" style="s2">to hear how sick is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:44.090" style="s2">but how normal how collective how deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.060" end="00:41:46.700" style="s2">am I not in touch with myself so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.090" end="00:41:48.980" style="s2">out of touch with myself when my women</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.700" end="00:41:50.840" style="s2">gets a woman gets grumpy I&#39;ve heard of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.980" end="00:41:53.750" style="s2">touch with my life like all the time</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.840" end="00:41:56.570" style="s2">so this is something of where we really</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.750" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">I think get humble and wise around how</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.570" end="00:42:03.320" style="s2">deeps wounding is and how big the gifts</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:05.869" style="s2">that we can get on this way because what</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.320" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">I notice is that if I don&#39;t lose my</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.869" end="00:42:10.460" style="s2">ground and I don&#39;t go into the pleasing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.030" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">boy and I don&#39;t go into the damage</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:15.170" style="s2">controlling thing and I stay grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:19.220" style="s2">myself and I ask for granted plus hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.170" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">what&#39;s going on I find women generally</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.220" end="00:42:25.640" style="s2">will go the sense that safety from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:29.380" style="s2">grounded Mexican and they&#39;ll go in their</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.640" end="00:42:32.180" style="s2">share very honestly and they&#39;ll tell me</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.380" end="00:42:33.890" style="s2">yeah no and it&#39;s really because in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.180" end="00:42:36.859" style="s2">it&#39;s the easy conversation and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.890" end="00:42:39.490" style="s2">rather than have a long complicated kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.859" end="00:42:43.100" style="s2">of thing that swims in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.490" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">maresi swampy territory for a few days</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.100" end="00:42:49.070" style="s2">it&#39;s over in a couple minutes and again</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:51.740" style="s2">I feel in the kind of you asking what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.070" end="00:42:54.050" style="s2">going on that I won&#39;t be able to get you</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.740" end="00:42:55.640" style="s2">with my manipulation so I can stop my</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.050" end="00:42:57.820" style="s2">drama queen behavior right at this</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.640" end="00:43:00.710" style="s2">moment and to be honest it&#39;s a relief</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.820" end="00:43:02.150" style="s2">but I don&#39;t get this exit normally</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.710" end="00:43:04.250" style="s2">because you always</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.150" end="00:43:05.930" style="s2">going on like honey can I be a better</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.250" end="00:43:08.390" style="s2">person and then you stop crying</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.930" end="00:43:10.910" style="s2">and so it&#39;s so interesting around men</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.390" end="00:43:12.829" style="s2">with healthy boundaries it&#39;s it&#39;s a high</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.270" end="00:43:28.670" style="s2">become safe enough to trust and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.809" end="00:43:30.559" style="s2">it&#39;s as you&#39;ve said it it&#39;s the growing</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.670" end="00:43:32.359" style="s2">up from a boy to a man being prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.559" end="00:43:35.059" style="s2">say something that might make a woman</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.359" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">reject you and being grounded enough to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.059" end="00:43:44.059" style="s2">be able to receive not happy reactions</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:48.260" style="s2">in the person yes yeah I think even</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.059" end="00:43:51.890" style="s2">retraction rejected of being the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.260" end="00:43:53.630" style="s2">being rejected from the woman is a fear</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.890" end="00:43:55.730" style="s2">of death because it&#39;s your mother</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.630" end="00:43:58.760" style="s2">rejecting you I think rejection itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.730" end="00:44:00.589" style="s2">isn&#39;t dangerous enough I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.760" end="00:44:03.079" style="s2">not something I&#39;m not love but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.589" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">threatened to death I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.079" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">sense it is an existential thing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:12.410" style="s2">really take it way way back yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:14.119" style="s2">manifests this is like rejection or so</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.410" end="00:44:16.700" style="s2">it&#39;s also that&#39;s maybe I&#39;m the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.119" end="00:44:19.010" style="s2">it or and then you enter into a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.700" end="00:44:21.559" style="s2">complex relationship with a feminine in</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.010" end="00:44:23.390" style="s2">that whole thing whereas you as I said a</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.559" end="00:44:24.380" style="s2">minute ago and you confirm it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.390" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">actually very simple</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:29.529" style="s2">but also from an evolutionary level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:31.970" style="s2">that women hold the key for men men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.529" end="00:44:34.099" style="s2">jeans to go into the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.970" end="00:44:37.400" style="s2">so being rejected by a woman is being</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.099" end="00:44:39.799" style="s2">rejected by its life by existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.400" end="00:44:41.359" style="s2">and on some level I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.799" end="00:44:43.460" style="s2">absolutely true I think that&#39;s the level</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.359" end="00:44:45.710" style="s2">of that&#39;s the level of existential</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:50.029" style="s2">terror that a lot of men have asking</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.710" end="00:44:51.289" style="s2">women out that in some sense they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.029" end="00:44:52.549" style="s2">standing in for the world they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.289" end="00:44:55.039" style="s2">standing in for nature they&#39;re standing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.549" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">in for existence itself so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.039" end="00:45:02.900" style="s2">a male ego thing it&#39;s really an urgent</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:06.260" style="s2">instinctual threat of yes or no life or</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.900" end="00:45:09.020" style="s2">death I want to this something else that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.260" end="00:45:11.630" style="s2">struck me recently as always thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.020" end="00:45:13.250" style="s2">about your film Hannah is that and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.630" end="00:45:13.819" style="s2">also saw this with some of the reactions</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.250" end="00:45:16.849" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.819" end="00:45:18.739" style="s2">was quite a few especially on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.849" end="00:45:21.469" style="s2">there were some reactions from guys who</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.739" end="00:45:24.559" style="s2">I&#39;d say to the mug town men going their</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.469" end="00:45:28.849" style="s2">own way or men&#39;s rights activists saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.559" end="00:45:32.289" style="s2">too late ladies you you won&#39;t trick us</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.849" end="00:45:36.140" style="s2">again all of this really sort of toxic</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.289" end="00:45:38.660" style="s2">pretty misogynistic comments and there</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.140" end="00:45:43.219" style="s2">are online there are quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.660" end="00:45:45.709" style="s2">places that where talk about women</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.219" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">degenerates into this very sort of toxic</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.709" end="00:45:51.890" style="s2">or very misogynistic very very</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:53.509" style="s2">suspicious very misogynistic place and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.890" end="00:45:55.989" style="s2">what I found really interesting when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.509" end="00:45:58.489" style="s2">was thinking about your film is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.989" end="00:46:01.849" style="s2">because there is very little discussion</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.489" end="00:46:04.099" style="s2">of the female shadow in culture the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.849" end="00:46:05.809" style="s2">place that I think a lot of guys who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.099" end="00:46:08.959" style="s2">maybe been hurting relationships</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.809" end="00:46:10.849" style="s2">find it is on these websites so suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.959" end="00:46:13.459" style="s2">the only place that you ever hear anyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.849" end="00:46:15.380" style="s2">talking about while women are women can</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.459" end="00:46:17.630" style="s2">be manipulative women can be bitch&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.380" end="00:46:19.459" style="s2">women can be like and behave badly if</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.630" end="00:46:22.789" style="s2">the only place that people find it is on</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.459" end="00:46:24.380" style="s2">these websites then what I think will</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.789" end="00:46:26.449" style="s2">happen is that people will then get more</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.380" end="00:46:28.190" style="s2">and more radicalized because on this</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.449" end="00:46:29.779" style="s2">websites it&#39;s not that women can behave</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.190" end="00:46:32.420" style="s2">like this it&#39;s women always behave like</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.779" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">this women always will ditch you for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.420" end="00:46:37.339" style="s2">more more attractive man they will you</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">can&#39;t trust what they say there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.339" end="00:46:45.079" style="s2">these kind of really yeah and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:48.140" style="s2">like you expressing both of you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.079" end="00:46:50.509" style="s2">expressing the the fact of the female</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.140" end="00:46:53.180" style="s2">shadow and bringing that somehow more</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.509" end="00:46:56.839" style="s2">into the conversation is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.180" end="00:46:58.130" style="s2">essential to because otherwise the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.839" end="00:47:01.549" style="s2">place that you can find it is where the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.130" end="00:47:04.069" style="s2">conversation goes toxic and making that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.549" end="00:47:06.949" style="s2">conversation much more mainstream I</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.069" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">think is essential really essential to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.949" end="00:47:12.559" style="s2">to try and because otherwise it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:15.140" style="s2">really unbalanced yes and I was really</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.559" end="00:47:16.940" style="s2">surprised - honestly I discovered these</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.140" end="00:47:20.059" style="s2">men&#39;s rights movement and men going</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.940" end="00:47:21.259" style="s2">their own way thanks to the film and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.059" end="00:47:24.289" style="s2">reactions to the film I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.259" end="00:47:25.609" style="s2">anything about it I had learned a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.289" end="00:47:28.910" style="s2">about men&#39;s moon</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.609" end="00:47:30.650" style="s2">I had started to see how difficult it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.910" end="00:47:34.279" style="s2">also to grow up as a man in this society</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.650" end="00:47:36.410" style="s2">and in this world but I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.279" end="00:47:41.779" style="s2">there could be and of course I knew</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.410" end="00:47:44.859" style="s2">about devaluation of women by men but</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.779" end="00:47:47.660" style="s2">that there can be so much hurt and hate</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.859" end="00:47:50.239" style="s2">against women as you find it on these</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.660" end="00:47:53.450" style="s2">websites I didn&#39;t even know I was not</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.239" end="00:47:55.039" style="s2">aware of and it&#39;s shocking some way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.450" end="00:47:57.529" style="s2">really shocking but it&#39;s also touching</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.039" end="00:48:02.299" style="s2">because it it shows how deep the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.529" end="00:48:06.309" style="s2">wounding is and something that stroked</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.299" end="00:48:13.400" style="s2">me is that I I start to see a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.309" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2">and a parallel between where feminism</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.400" end="00:48:20.989" style="s2">has partly gone where me too has partly</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:24.109" style="s2">gun means turned into something toxic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.989" end="00:48:26.660" style="s2">turned instead of standing up for our</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.109" end="00:48:29.989" style="s2">rights and our boundaries starting to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.660" end="00:48:31.910" style="s2">fight all men collectively sitting in we</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.989" end="00:48:34.099" style="s2">are the victims we are the poor ones and</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.910" end="00:48:39.170" style="s2">you are all all the bad ones</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.099" end="00:48:43.069" style="s2">and it struck me to see that these men</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.170" end="00:48:45.410" style="s2">who write in that way in these internet</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.069" end="00:48:47.809" style="s2">pages etc are doing exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:49.609" style="s2">they saying we men are the victims and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.809" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">all women are evil and now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.609" end="00:48:54.529" style="s2">fight the women instead of standing up</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:56.390" style="s2">and saying stop here I have a clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.529" end="00:48:58.759" style="s2">boundary because not all men are evil</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.390" end="00:49:00.680" style="s2">and we have our wounds we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.759" end="00:49:05.859" style="s2">experience we have had a lot of bad</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.680" end="00:49:08.450" style="s2">experiences that is great but but this</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.859" end="00:49:09.980" style="s2">going into a victim&#39;s hole and pointing</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.450" end="00:49:13.190" style="s2">the finger finger and fighting</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.980" end="00:49:14.599" style="s2">collectively the other sex I can see it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.190" end="00:49:17.029" style="s2">on both sides and it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.599" end="00:49:19.309" style="s2">anywhere it&#39;s as Patrick&#39;s would work it</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.029" end="00:49:21.890" style="s2">would have worked already yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.309" end="00:49:24.769" style="s2">really like flipping it around it just</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.890" end="00:49:26.779" style="s2">changes the color of the same problem we</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.769" end="00:49:29.539" style="s2">won&#39;t get anywhere with the same metrics</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.779" end="00:49:32.749" style="s2">with the same thinking and yet and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.539" end="00:49:35.569" style="s2">but it&#39;s also true for both sides that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.749" end="00:49:37.430" style="s2">see the pain where it comes from I see</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.569" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen it for a woman first to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.430" end="00:49:41.329" style="s2">honest</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:43.279" style="s2">but I see it there now too and I see</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.329" end="00:49:45.740" style="s2">many things they have gone through and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.279" end="00:49:49.369" style="s2">I&#39;m happy what you have pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.740" end="00:49:51.170" style="s2">yes that this film might be one</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.369" end="00:49:54.130" style="s2">contribution I hope it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.170" end="00:49:58.130" style="s2">beginning of a new conversation a</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.130" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">beginning of a contribution to offering</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.130" end="00:50:06.470" style="s2">space for having these conversations in</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:09.019" style="s2">the more mature way and in a more</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.470" end="00:50:12.170" style="s2">constructive way and I am actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.019" end="00:50:17.720" style="s2">touched by quite some feedbacks I get</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.170" end="00:50:21.049" style="s2">from man who have experienced very badly</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.720" end="00:50:23.539" style="s2">but have very bad experiences many wrote</p>
