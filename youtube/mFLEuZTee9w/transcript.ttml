<p begin="00:00:12.150" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">that they don&#39;t happen hoping that by</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:16.740" style="s2">virtue of saying and it&#39;s like a spell</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.179" end="00:00:18.090" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t happen that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.740" end="00:00:20.600" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:23.100" style="s2">well actually in our first conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.600" end="00:00:25.800" style="s2">you said something that gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.100" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">shivers he said like you said like what</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">happens if a million people are you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">died and we have to watch that and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">would the culture do he said something</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.739" end="00:00:41.700" style="s2">like that and that was like like a month</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">before this whole business came down and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.700" end="00:00:46.050" style="s2">I remember when you said that I you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">people say stuff and you don&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.050" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">you just it just washes over you most of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">the time but that kind of made me shiver</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">a little bit I remember that moment that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:01:01.430" style="s2">to him I&#39;m releasing the the one heaven</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">dialogue that three of us had tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.430" end="00:01:13.070" style="s2">on my channel so cool cool great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:13.070" style="s2">well maybe we can we can delve in deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">with the subject with the subjects that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve already started to discuss you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">know we are talking about we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">started talking we talking about kovat</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">how this is a strange time a weird time</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:34.549" style="s2">a bizarre time and and and the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">actually time itself is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.549" end="00:01:41.909" style="s2">different during this period and which</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">is the Greek word Kairos that was my</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.909" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">first question that I had for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">is is if you could collaborate on this</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:59.810" style="s2">this Kairos this idea of critical moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">sure you might I go for a second so is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.810" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">what&#39;s important to that I put some</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">fighting into that before all of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">when because in my series because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">originally got the notion from Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">he talks about it in quite a bit of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:20.520" style="s2">work and also connection you know it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:25.610" style="s2">took the courage to be and which he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.520" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">dealing with the meeting crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.610" end="00:02:32.580" style="s2">effect it&#39;s having on religion and his</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:34.380" style="s2">time and of course it&#39;s he gets it he</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.580" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">has the Christian slant on it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.380" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">he&#39;s a Protestant theologian but and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">claims that it was that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">really interesting sort of Christian</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">spin on the Greek term one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:51.980" style="s2">original metaphor is not metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:56.070" style="s2">mythological in the good sense of myth</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.980" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">is the idea that of christ&#39;s advent came</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.070" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">in the fullness of time so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:05.300" style="s2">that systems will go along in place and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">they have a lot of inertia to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.300" end="00:03:10.050" style="s2">they&#39;re very resistant to change and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:15.300" style="s2">then certain sets of conditions will</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.050" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">console 8 such that an intervention will</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.300" end="00:03:19.800" style="s2">have a huge has a huge potential to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">really steer the course of things so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.800" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">idea about a Kairos is a fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">time in which timing matters because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">can turn the way in which time unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:33.300" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s sort of many things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:36.170" style="s2">but that we&#39;re only in potentia have</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.300" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">come to a place where actualization and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.170" end="00:03:43.830" style="s2">transformation is possible and and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.800" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">the way I try to take that mythological</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.830" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">notion that mythological existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">notion because you you know you can note</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">you can note that in your own life you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:52.800" style="s2">do not like when you&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.630" style="s2">relationship with person and you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.800" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">come to a point where you feel that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.630" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">know the relationship has been stable</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">and then it hits this point right it</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:02.610" style="s2">hits this point and you go oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">this you know people talk about maker</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.610" end="00:04:09.090" style="s2">breakpoints in in relationships and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:11.070" style="s2">you get a sense that oh this this could</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">change the whole course of nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.070" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">relationship so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">mythological sense there&#39;s that personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">phenomenological sense and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:21.510" style="s2">it I try to map it onto dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">systems and the idea of criticality in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.510" end="00:04:27.390" style="s2">self-organizing systems this comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:27.540" style="s2">per Bach systems are self-organizing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.390" end="00:04:29.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.540" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">quite stable and then they get to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.760" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">point where the processes the very</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">processes that made them stable actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">start to undermine their structure the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">classic example is the grain of you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">the column of stand that&#39;s falling and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:44.460" style="s2">it builds a mound and the mound is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.230" style="s2">stable for long periods and then when it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.460" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">gets too high because of its</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.230" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">self-organization it goes critical it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:52.530" style="s2">avalanches its structure breaks down and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">that criticality can either lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.530" end="00:04:58.140" style="s2">disintegration of the system or it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.080" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">afford a new base from which something</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.140" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">new can emerge and be restructured and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:05.040" style="s2">so in my mind I sort of put those three</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:06.570" style="s2">together when I think about Kairos and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.040" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">think we&#39;re getting increasing evidence</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.570" end="00:05:12.630" style="s2">that we&#39;re in something I mean I think a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:17.250" style="s2">lot of stuff is already chaotic and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.630" end="00:05:22.910" style="s2">I think the the the Cova crisis has just</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.250" end="00:05:22.910" style="s2">been an accelerant of of the Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.530" end="00:05:32.040" style="s2">Blair I yeah I mean I hold it similarly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.920" end="00:05:34.350" style="s2">I first got it actually from off table</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.040" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">Omar who was at Meridian University</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.350" end="00:05:39.200" style="s2">whose students of James Helens work and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:42.840" style="s2">then read it read Hillman writing about</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.200" end="00:05:45.270" style="s2">Kairos and relating it to this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.840" end="00:05:47.610" style="s2">opportunity in particular and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.270" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">kind of like penetrable opening within</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.610" end="00:05:53.780" style="s2">the usually impenetrable fabric of fate</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">or time that there&#39;s like a nick in time</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.780" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">like in the nick of time in the sense if</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a chink in the armor of Chronos</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">so that you can get in somehow and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:08.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about it too and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">relating it to the complex systems is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.850" end="00:06:12.930" style="s2">something that I do instinctively in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:15.060" style="s2">in the realm of like individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.930" end="00:06:17.310" style="s2">development that if you look at critical</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.060" end="00:06:19.530" style="s2">periods in the development of any</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.310" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">individual the critical period of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.530" end="00:06:23.730" style="s2">adolescent identity formation for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">example like most of adolescence feels</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.730" end="00:06:28.620" style="s2">chyron ik it feels so much pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">opportunity so much can go right or</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.620" end="00:06:33.810" style="s2">wrong and so much is locking in even</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.110" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">physiological the dysregulation andrey</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.810" end="00:06:38.139" style="s2">regulation of whole parts of identity</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:40.090" style="s2">structure but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.139" end="00:06:43.569" style="s2">hormones and growth spurts and other</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.090" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">things similarly in early childhood when</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.569" end="00:06:48.009" style="s2">you&#39;ve got these critical the so called</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:49.900" style="s2">critical periods which are not set in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.009" end="00:06:52.539" style="s2">stone but you can feel them when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.900" end="00:06:55.289" style="s2">happening as an educator or a parent and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.539" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of written into the way the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.289" end="00:07:00.879" style="s2">system develops and grows so similar</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:04.840" style="s2">then you have a system that&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.879" end="00:07:06.819" style="s2">like embryologically for example or</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.840" end="00:07:07.719" style="s2">developmentally epigenetically within</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.819" end="00:07:11.770" style="s2">childhood</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.770" end="00:07:17.110" style="s2">equilibration adolescence is a great</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.750" end="00:07:20.500" style="s2">example where there&#39;s to be expected a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.110" end="00:07:22.120" style="s2">kind of identity dysregulation affective</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.500" end="00:07:25.180" style="s2">dysregulation these things are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:27.279" style="s2">par for the course there because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:31.960" style="s2">system&#39;s trying to get up and into some</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.279" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">new form of patterning so crises are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.960" end="00:07:36.009" style="s2">usually moments of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:40.419" style="s2">they&#39;re usually these moments of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.009" end="00:07:42.009" style="s2">and identity crises in particular when</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.419" end="00:07:44.919" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.009" end="00:07:46.659" style="s2">the kind of phenomenology of Kairos in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.919" end="00:07:48.189" style="s2">your own life like what&#39;s it like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.659" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">does it feel like you can remember those</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.189" end="00:07:54.449" style="s2">periods in your life when it just ended</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:57.189" style="s2">and so the question of kind of antigen</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.449" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny to what</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.189" end="00:08:02.139" style="s2">extent we can apply that model to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:04.629" style="s2">growth of cultures and civilizations we</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.139" end="00:08:07.180" style="s2">could say something like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.629" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">civilization is in a kind of adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.180" end="00:08:14.919" style="s2">identity crisis of mmm neurotic import</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:17.949" style="s2">which is to say like this if we become a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.919" end="00:08:19.899" style="s2">planetary civilization this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.949" end="00:08:22.149" style="s2">pandemic is something we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.899" end="00:08:24.490" style="s2">to be able to deal with because of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.149" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">nature of Trade and the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.490" end="00:08:28.569" style="s2">travel and the nature of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:29.949" style="s2">organization structures it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.569" end="00:08:33.010" style="s2">like this is much like to be a mature</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.949" end="00:08:34.930" style="s2">species that has planet eyes like grow</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.010" end="00:08:37.779" style="s2">up we need to figure out how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.930" end="00:08:39.640" style="s2">with this and so that&#39;s this moment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.779" end="00:08:42.329" style="s2">opportunity where either the adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.640" end="00:08:44.860" style="s2">feels with reality or the adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.329" end="00:08:46.269" style="s2">adapts to miss adapts to reality and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.860" end="00:08:47.410" style="s2">create some identity structure and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.269" end="00:08:49.620" style="s2">behavior patterns that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.410" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">maladaptive and then you&#39;ve locked in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.620" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">kind of a difficult way forward into</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:57.899" style="s2">full maturation if not an end up being</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:00.550" style="s2">self terminating identity construction</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.899" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">mmm-hmm so that&#39;s one way I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.550" end="00:09:05.190" style="s2">model it I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">think about it that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.190" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">you know there are limitations to it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:12.850" style="s2">there&#39;s something powerful to yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">said that just you said that it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.850" end="00:09:20.140" style="s2">or either you go into a new higher level</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:22.089" style="s2">of realization or the thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.140" end="00:09:24.040" style="s2">disintegrates and when I was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.089" end="00:09:28.449" style="s2">I think both kind of happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.040" end="00:09:29.980" style="s2">simultaneously right it depends I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.449" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">isn&#39;t that what sort of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.980" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">now or what could be happening now or</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2">well I mean it&#39;s may be that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a degree of the criticality</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.100" end="00:09:45.569" style="s2">means the previous structure is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:49.240" style="s2">disintegrating literally to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.569" end="00:09:51.430" style="s2">so but there is there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.240" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">tipping point right where if you go too</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.430" end="00:09:56.079" style="s2">far the disintegration the entropy</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">overtakes the system and the system</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.079" end="00:10:03.130" style="s2">collapses right and and and and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:06.310" style="s2">might you might and and then it gets in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.130" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">it can get stuck into a aberrant pattern</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.310" end="00:10:08.949" style="s2">which is kind of like I think with</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:11.829" style="s2">Jacques is talking about with the waking</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.949" end="00:10:15.220" style="s2">goal become maladaptive you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.829" end="00:10:17.560" style="s2">team you know who you know gets into</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.220" end="00:10:19.810" style="s2">crime or something like that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.560" end="00:10:21.069" style="s2">like that but there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.810" end="00:10:24.339" style="s2">want to riff on with Jacques said</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.069" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">because so when you look at that those</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.339" end="00:10:28.750" style="s2">that self-organizing criticality you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">actually see it in the brain you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.750" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">actually see it at work in the insight</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.120" style="s2">like this is the work of stuff and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">Dixon in fact if when people are locked</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.120" end="00:10:37.449" style="s2">into a frame and this is why maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:39.069" style="s2">bringing in framing might help because</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.449" end="00:10:40.360" style="s2">we could sort of link framing an</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.069" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">identity that might give us even a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.360" end="00:10:45.160" style="s2">richer metaphor because they get locked</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:47.260" style="s2">into a particular frame and then what</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.160" end="00:10:49.060" style="s2">you have to do is you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.260" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">you have to throw a lot of noise you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.060" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">have to destabilize them you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.040" style="s2">introduce entropy into the system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:57.160" style="s2">then that will actually provoke an</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.040" end="00:11:00.069" style="s2">insight and what&#39;s interesting is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.160" end="00:11:00.970" style="s2">can see development I mean I think you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.069" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">did make a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.970" end="00:11:07.840" style="s2">if from interpreting Piaget because he</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:10.360" style="s2">sees the stages as bound to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.840" end="00:11:12.610" style="s2">systematicity of error you could see</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.360" end="00:11:14.740" style="s2">development when you move from one stage</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.610" end="00:11:17.560" style="s2">to another a systematic insight not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.740" end="00:11:21.100" style="s2">an insight here or here but a much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.560" end="00:11:24.130" style="s2">comprehensive set of insights like so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.100" end="00:11:26.290" style="s2">that your entire ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.130" end="00:11:28.510" style="s2">world entire ways of being would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.290" end="00:11:30.430" style="s2">changing and that&#39;s where you could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.510" end="00:11:32.830" style="s2">even see the cognitive change and the a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.430" end="00:11:36.340" style="s2">change in identity are then start to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.830" end="00:11:42.580" style="s2">woven together and and why why that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.340" end="00:11:45.850" style="s2">might be helpful to think about it is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.580" end="00:11:47.140" style="s2">sort of officially in terms of the text</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.850" end="00:11:49.630" style="s2">books we&#39;re not we&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.140" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">call them critical periods anymore was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.630" end="00:11:54.040" style="s2">for because because the turn out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:55.210" style="s2">term had that you know the you know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.040" end="00:11:56.830" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re not exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.210" end="00:11:58.570" style="s2">language by the time you&#39;re 12</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.830" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">you&#39;ll never get syntax and it had that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.570" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">sort of so the the terminology doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:08.590" style="s2">matter but it&#39;s felicitous here because</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:12.070" style="s2">we now call them sensitive periods and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.590" end="00:12:13.840" style="s2">so the idea here is just like the noise</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.070" end="00:12:15.910" style="s2">can sensitize the system and make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.840" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">possible for it insight and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.910" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">at complex systems you have sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:22.660" style="s2">dependence on initial conditions when</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.310" style="s2">you get into these Kairos States actions</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.660" end="00:12:27.190" style="s2">that normally that would have just been</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.310" end="00:12:30.070" style="s2">submerged into the system have like they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.190" end="00:12:31.840" style="s2">have a tremendous capacity the sense to</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.070" end="00:12:35.800" style="s2">change the future course of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.840" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">system mmm and and so why I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.800" end="00:12:38.920" style="s2">that up story this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:41.650" style="s2">belated I&#39;m trying to get the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.920" end="00:12:44.230" style="s2">and the the development of identity</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.650" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">linked to this notion of a special kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.230" end="00:12:51.850" style="s2">of sensitivity because what that then</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">brings in that is that there&#39;s a timing</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.850" end="00:12:55.210" style="s2">issue to this right there&#39;s a timing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:58.300" style="s2">issue to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.210" end="00:13:00.210" style="s2">that&#39;s really really crucial so like an</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.300" end="00:13:05.170" style="s2">action that would it have been impotent</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.210" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">four weeks five weeks ago yeah right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.170" end="00:13:10.150" style="s2">might make a big difference and it might</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">also be impotent from five weeks from</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.150" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">now right we&#39;re in we&#39;re in a period</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">where this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:19.690" style="s2">system is sensitive to our actions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">if we can figure out a system ax tissa T</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.690" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">in the air this is how I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:25.330" style="s2">bring it all together we can make an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:26.740" style="s2">intervention that can permeate</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.330" end="00:13:29.470" style="s2">promulgate throughout that entire</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.740" end="00:13:31.510" style="s2">systematicity so it seems like if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.470" end="00:13:34.900" style="s2">could just jump in that what we do right</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.510" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">now is very important yeah it&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.900" end="00:13:37.690" style="s2">do right now is very important but we</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:39.610" style="s2">have to couple that to a deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.690" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">discernment we have to try and track out</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.610" end="00:13:46.210" style="s2">like is it in all of the chaos and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:48.670" style="s2">of the noise is there a systematicity of</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.930" end="00:13:58.930" style="s2">something happens in their cognition</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.430" end="00:14:01.450" style="s2">where their brain figures out oh wait</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.450" end="00:14:05.950" style="s2">doing this from now on I won&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.580" end="00:14:07.570" style="s2">of these mistakes again we could do</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.570" end="00:14:11.620" style="s2">there has to be like we have to find</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.620" end="00:14:16.420" style="s2">to find where we could do so we can find</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.540" end="00:14:18.910" style="s2">like a nexus point right so we can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.420" end="00:14:20.920" style="s2">can we can find what&#39;s it sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.910" end="00:14:22.900" style="s2">and where&#39;s the nexus point and where</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.920" end="00:14:26.920" style="s2">can our actions make the most impact</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.900" end="00:14:28.780" style="s2">right now so it&#39;s a timing it&#39;s a timing</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.920" end="00:14:30.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a sensitivity issue it&#39;s an issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.780" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">but trying to find the systematicity in</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.940" end="00:14:35.050" style="s2">the error I think the people like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:38.500" style="s2">got a we&#39;ve got a shift off of it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.050" end="00:14:39.640" style="s2">chaos we&#39;ve got a shift - okay yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.500" end="00:14:42.430" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of noise there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.640" end="00:14:43.810" style="s2">entropy let&#39;s try and find because if</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.430" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2">there&#39;s no systematicity - very well</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.810" end="00:14:48.430" style="s2">we&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s no systematicity error our</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.430" end="00:14:51.520" style="s2">interventions won&#39;t make a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:52.680" style="s2">difference and the system just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.520" end="00:14:56.050" style="s2">everything&#39;s just going to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.680" end="00:14:57.730" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a timing issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.050" end="00:14:59.350" style="s2">it&#39;s the sensitivity issue and most</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.730" end="00:15:02.200" style="s2">importantly it&#39;s a discernment issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.350" end="00:15:05.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to do a lot of work to try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.200" end="00:15:07.210" style="s2">figure out what do what what what what</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.740" end="00:15:09.130" style="s2">Gestalt what Consulate&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.210" end="00:15:12.070" style="s2">all these error signals so that we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.130" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">some kind of unified sense of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.070" end="00:15:17.170" style="s2">make use of the carros that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.170" end="00:15:22.060" style="s2">so I&#39;m at me let&#39;s did that make I did I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.420" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">think it did um Zach</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.060" end="00:15:27.250" style="s2">maybe Zach could riff on on this notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:30.040" style="s2">of what we work how we can make use of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.250" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">this Kairos because that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.040" end="00:15:37.810" style="s2">question right is and you know what John</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.199" end="00:15:38.829" style="s2">speaking to is exactly correct from my</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.810" end="00:15:42.070" style="s2">perspective of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.829" end="00:15:45.310" style="s2">development and learning like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.070" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">in a class and during the entire class</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.310" end="00:15:48.040" style="s2">you get through you&#39;re never confused</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:49.690" style="s2">and you&#39;re right like a perfect paper at</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.040" end="00:15:52.510" style="s2">the end you have not learned anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.690" end="00:15:54.100" style="s2">right yeah well you I&#39;ve always tell my</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.510" end="00:15:56.620" style="s2">students like I want you to be very</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.100" end="00:15:58.810" style="s2">confused at certain points and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.620" end="00:16:00.190" style="s2">confusion is like it&#39;s kind of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.810" end="00:16:01.449" style="s2">because you thought you understood and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.190" end="00:16:03.550" style="s2">now you&#39;ve encountered something and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.449" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand so you&#39;ve been what</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.550" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">Piaget says disequilibrium right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:10.779" style="s2">ability for you to just like run with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:15.790" style="s2">is it no longer viable you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.779" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">somehow adjust your operating and so if</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.790" end="00:16:20.769" style="s2">you&#39;re in a situation you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:22.660" style="s2">develop or learn you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.769" end="00:16:25.269" style="s2">comfortable with being disick wa</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.660" end="00:16:28.570" style="s2">liberated thrown off and put in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.269" end="00:16:30.130" style="s2">chaotic confusion and then as Johnny</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.570" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">Sack I was not saying within that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.130" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">need to then start looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:35.290" style="s2">invariants because I&#39;m going you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">hunting that&#39;s what Piaget was always</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.290" end="00:16:41.529" style="s2">looking for the the abstraction of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:43.870" style="s2">invariants from from the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.529" end="00:16:45.370" style="s2">first you discover the environment with</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.870" end="00:16:49.089" style="s2">your son the invariants with your</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.370" end="00:16:50.769" style="s2">sensory motor properties and affordances</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.089" end="00:16:53.079" style="s2">of the body and then slowly you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.769" end="00:16:55.630" style="s2">extracting Berens from the social and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.079" end="00:16:57.820" style="s2">the physical into these abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.630" end="00:17:01.089" style="s2">then into principles and paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.820" end="00:17:02.649" style="s2">processes and things so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.089" end="00:17:05.860" style="s2">something here there&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.649" end="00:17:08.610" style="s2">for the social system itself to move</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.860" end="00:17:12.939" style="s2">into a kind of higher order of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.610" end="00:17:14.549" style="s2">abstraction and complexity being able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.939" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">look at what&#39;s actually invariant</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.549" end="00:17:19.540" style="s2">because when the simulation is going</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:20.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite clear to tell what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.540" end="00:17:22.510" style="s2">and what&#39;s not real where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.890" end="00:17:24.760" style="s2">invariance like it&#39;s all working so when</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:26.949" style="s2">you&#39;re perfectly aquila braiding your</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.760" end="00:17:28.089" style="s2">class and economics so it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.949" end="00:17:29.480" style="s2">perfect sense there&#39;s a good opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.089" end="00:17:32.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.480" end="00:17:34.230" style="s2">part of economics precisely because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.760" end="00:17:35.669" style="s2">working but there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.230" end="00:17:37.260" style="s2">there&#39;s something missing there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.669" end="00:17:38.760" style="s2">working so well that you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.260" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">something&#39;s wrong it&#39;s working so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.760" end="00:17:42.990" style="s2">can&#39;t and so this is what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:44.580" style="s2">happening with the civilization for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.990" end="00:17:47.190" style="s2">long time it&#39;s been working so well for</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.580" end="00:17:49.770" style="s2">the key members of the whole nation</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.190" end="00:17:52.250" style="s2">yeah yeah yep enough error signal it can</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.770" end="00:17:54.510" style="s2">absorb it it&#39;s so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.250" end="00:17:55.620" style="s2">exactly so it&#39;s absorbing their signal</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.510" end="00:17:58.470" style="s2">and so now there&#39;s this thing where are</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.620" end="00:18:00.179" style="s2">now we&#39;re getting a sense of all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.470" end="00:18:01.500" style="s2">possible error signals and now is John</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.179" end="00:18:03.419" style="s2">saying we can look at the system today</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.500" end="00:18:05.370" style="s2">the error systematicity of the errors</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.419" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">and detect the invariance and the mass</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.370" end="00:18:10.140" style="s2">the opportunity to move to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:12.510" style="s2">order of abstraction spelled reflective</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.140" end="00:18:14.429" style="s2">abstraction in the pisciadood model and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.510" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">then you have the grasp of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.429" end="00:18:18.419" style="s2">with the company&#39;s own so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.960" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">inside which is we put it in front of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.419" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">you the subject becomes object as Keegan</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">says and then the grasp of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:26.789" style="s2">comes in there&#39;s insight and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:28.770" style="s2">can consolidate at the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.789" end="00:18:30.630" style="s2">hopefully is that&#39;s the other thing you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.770" end="00:18:32.909" style="s2">can have the insight and then drop back</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.630" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">down and this is Kurt Fisher is great</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.909" end="00:18:36.630" style="s2">instead like this movement about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">zone of proximal development the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.630" end="00:18:41.100" style="s2">development to a range is such that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:43.830" style="s2">can pop up and see it and then drop back</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.100" end="00:18:46.200" style="s2">down let me hop up and see it again drop</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.830" end="00:18:48.299" style="s2">back down so it&#39;s not just eating the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.200" end="00:18:50.490" style="s2">inside it&#39;s also finding the ways to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.299" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">the scaffolding in place to secure the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.490" end="00:18:57.960" style="s2">inside now kind of moving forward and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:19:00.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the level consolidation and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.960" end="00:19:01.830" style="s2">then there&#39;s this notion of enduring and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.120" end="00:19:03.150" style="s2">transitional structures as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.830" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">developmental process that there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.150" end="00:19:08.730" style="s2">some structures which are transient</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:10.169" style="s2">they&#39;re put in place temporarily to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.730" end="00:19:11.970" style="s2">to a structure that&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.169" end="00:19:15.450" style="s2">enduring structure part of the learning</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.970" end="00:19:17.610" style="s2">process like different kind of steps</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.450" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">that you can use you can have parts of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.610" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">the web as fisher described it that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:25.470" style="s2">yeah what structures are enduring and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">what structures are sort of superficial</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.470" end="00:19:29.970" style="s2">and are just treads transition</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">structures right and this is the deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.970" end="00:19:33.419" style="s2">question and development you know like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:35.400" style="s2">there are some structures you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.419" end="00:19:36.990" style="s2">discard like the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.400" end="00:19:38.530" style="s2">mathematics that you got from sensory</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.990" end="00:19:40.630" style="s2">motor operation</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.530" end="00:19:43.000" style="s2">those are partier and during cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.630" end="00:19:45.730" style="s2">structures but lower levels of moral</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.000" end="00:19:47.049" style="s2">development often you do kind of discard</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.730" end="00:19:50.409" style="s2">or at least you put them in a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.049" end="00:19:53.770" style="s2">kind of context so yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.409" end="00:19:57.070" style="s2">many strands here but I pick up my</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.770" end="00:19:58.870" style="s2">general yeah please so one is to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.070" end="00:20:00.909" style="s2">so what you just said was very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.870" end="00:20:02.440" style="s2">because it helps me try to refine this</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.909" end="00:20:04.600" style="s2">discernment that I&#39;m trying to put up</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.440" end="00:20:09.490" style="s2">because part of like let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.600" end="00:20:11.169" style="s2">the insight problem-solving and one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.490" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">the things you do to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.169" end="00:20:14.770" style="s2">afford insight as you call it you do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:16.179" style="s2">notice and variance heuristic you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.770" end="00:20:17.710" style="s2">people to pay attention and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.179" end="00:20:20.200" style="s2">where why humility is really important</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.710" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">but you get people to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.200" end="00:20:24.549" style="s2">failed problem formulations and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:27.370" style="s2">try to notice what&#39;s invariant across</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.549" end="00:20:29.230" style="s2">those problem formulations and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.370" end="00:20:31.419" style="s2">change that and that&#39;s exactly how you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.230" end="00:20:33.700" style="s2">afford insight so this this brings up a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.419" end="00:20:36.520" style="s2">sort of a question in my mind it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.700" end="00:20:38.710" style="s2">of a challenge to discernment which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.520" end="00:20:39.850" style="s2">how do you you have to you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.710" end="00:20:42.010" style="s2">know you have to notice the good</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.850" end="00:20:43.630" style="s2">invariance that you&#39;re gonna track as</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.010" end="00:20:45.130" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about exact but you also</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.630" end="00:20:47.080" style="s2">have to notice the bad invariance that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.130" end="00:20:49.720" style="s2">you have to let go of but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.080" end="00:20:51.130" style="s2">abandon in order to get the insight that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.720" end="00:20:52.870" style="s2">is needed for the transformation does</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.130" end="00:20:55.270" style="s2">that make they&#39;re sort of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.870" end="00:20:57.309" style="s2">wisdom is what&#39;s the so you get the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.270" end="00:20:58.299" style="s2">noise we turn it into systematicity as</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.309" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">you said we&#39;re looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.299" end="00:21:01.750" style="s2">invariance but I think there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:03.250" style="s2">something more fine-grain we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.750" end="00:21:04.450" style="s2">able to discern the good invariance if</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.250" end="00:21:06.429" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me these normative terms</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.450" end="00:21:08.770" style="s2">from the bad invariance the bad</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.429" end="00:21:11.409" style="s2">invariants like that might be you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.770" end="00:21:13.809" style="s2">analogous to you know the sets of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.409" end="00:21:15.750" style="s2">constraints in the child schema you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.809" end="00:21:18.460" style="s2">that was actually holding them back and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.750" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">they have to be relaxed but as you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.460" end="00:21:22.299" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you abandon all</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:25.690" style="s2">invariance because that&#39;s a disaster and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.299" end="00:21:27.309" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just it&#39;s not sorry I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.690" end="00:21:28.510" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to be critical or exact</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.309" end="00:21:31.299" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to build on it it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.510" end="00:21:33.370" style="s2">sort of finding the invariance it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.299" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">finding it&#39;s also distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.370" end="00:21:37.750" style="s2">the two kinds of invariants and getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:42.280" style="s2">the right trade-off between them I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.750" end="00:21:45.130" style="s2">it&#39;s part of what we&#39;re also what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.280" end="00:21:46.630" style="s2">also trying to get to with your help to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.130" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">this notion of discernment that we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.630" end="00:21:51.110" style="s2">to bring in did does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:56.120" style="s2">it does makes perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.110" end="00:21:59.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.120" end="00:22:02.450" style="s2">emotion and cognition are completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.150" end="00:22:04.460" style="s2">inter digitated and union model and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:05.809" style="s2">you get although those works mostly are</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.460" end="00:22:07.130" style="s2">not translated so he&#39;s conceived as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.809" end="00:22:08.990" style="s2">cognitive but it always says that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.130" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">feeling emotion and cognition they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.990" end="00:22:14.090" style="s2">related and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:15.500" style="s2">discernments not just cognitive cuz</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.090" end="00:22:17.150" style="s2">you&#39;re right there&#39;s a lot I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.500" end="00:22:18.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of invariants that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.150" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">don&#39;t own you know because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.860" end="00:22:24.740" style="s2">relevant right because it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:28.610" style="s2">the of the field of what matters to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.740" end="00:22:31.100" style="s2">developing child and so this is where</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.610" end="00:22:33.500" style="s2">again I think our identity and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.100" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">are related as well because eventually</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.500" end="00:22:40.340" style="s2">what matters to me is a function of who</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">I take myself to be and so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.340" end="00:22:46.160" style="s2">this question of who one is and how one</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:52.090" style="s2">feels which is to say how one uses</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.160" end="00:22:56.299" style="s2">emotion as an information system those</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.090" end="00:22:58.250" style="s2">are kind of like more foundational than</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.299" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">the cognitive moment not more</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.250" end="00:23:02.780" style="s2">foundational but there&#39;s a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:06.500" style="s2">interaction between these and you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.780" end="00:23:08.540" style="s2">you cannot remove and this is what makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.500" end="00:23:12.790" style="s2">AI so dangerous right is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.540" end="00:23:15.770" style="s2">removing the affective and embodied</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.790" end="00:23:18.740" style="s2">vector of salience and relevance let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.770" end="00:23:21.049" style="s2">say then your unmoored</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.740" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">from what actually matters and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.049" end="00:23:24.200" style="s2">that difference between the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">and the reality that civilizations going</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:29.720" style="s2">to Sue&#39;s that if you&#39;re if the commodity</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.730" style="s2">disguises its relation to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.720" end="00:23:33.020" style="s2">biosphere so you don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.730" end="00:23:36.110" style="s2">actually this thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.020" end="00:23:38.059" style="s2">it&#39;s the disembodied idea but the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.110" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">actual body is quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.059" end="00:23:42.350" style="s2">completely unsustainable couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:43.910" style="s2">extracted at that rate for another two</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.350" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">years five years you know depending on</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.910" end="00:23:49.220" style="s2">what the commodity is and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:54.250" style="s2">this way that though the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.220" end="00:23:57.110" style="s2">apparatus needs to be within the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.250" end="00:23:58.290" style="s2">affective and the evaluative and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.110" end="00:24:01.230" style="s2">embodied contain</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.290" end="00:24:04.830" style="s2">when that helps get the sense of which</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.230" end="00:24:05.460" style="s2">invariance am i detecting right I agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.830" end="00:24:07.950" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.460" end="00:24:10.830" style="s2">I mean fact I think that&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.950" end="00:24:12.660" style="s2">to relevance realization Montagu</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.830" end="00:24:14.370" style="s2">actually talked about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.660" end="00:24:17.310" style="s2">difference between us and computers to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.370" end="00:24:19.020" style="s2">use your your point azar is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.310" end="00:24:19.860" style="s2">to take care of ourselves and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.020" end="00:24:22.200" style="s2">therefore we have to care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.860" end="00:24:24.870" style="s2">information and so I&#39;m using care here</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.200" end="00:24:26.430" style="s2">in a Heidegger sense that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.870" end="00:24:28.590" style="s2">taught as relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.430" end="00:24:30.570" style="s2">ultimately and I think this will get us</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.590" end="00:24:32.910" style="s2">back to the affective stuff even the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.570" end="00:24:33.720" style="s2">existential stuff the the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.910" end="00:24:36.120" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the level of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.720" end="00:24:37.800" style="s2">identity because relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.120" end="00:24:39.960" style="s2">is also ultimately processed by which</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.800" end="00:24:41.730" style="s2">you&#39;re committing it&#39;s it&#39;s it is acts</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.960" end="00:24:43.620" style="s2">of commitment and they could be micro</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.250" end="00:24:59.400" style="s2">ultimately and this is what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:01.070" style="s2">have to do the a I think but this is one</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.400" end="00:25:03.780" style="s2">of the things holding back AI right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.070" end="00:25:05.640" style="s2">because because ultimately relevance</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.780" end="00:25:07.890" style="s2">realization is never cold calculation</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.640" end="00:25:10.410" style="s2">it&#39;s never cold calculation it&#39;s always</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.410" end="00:25:15.060" style="s2">sound like howdy there and commitment is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.990" end="00:25:17.160" style="s2">always an act of caring and commitment</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.060" end="00:25:20.340" style="s2">and caring are always identity forming</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.160" end="00:25:22.560" style="s2">processes that&#39;s just the way I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.340" end="00:25:24.360" style="s2">best way to find out who I am is not to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.560" end="00:25:26.700" style="s2">do some sort of romantic introspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.360" end="00:25:29.070" style="s2">act it&#39;s to pay careful attention to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.700" end="00:25:31.350" style="s2">what I systematically care about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.070" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s that that&#39;s a clearer way of</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.180" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">is and so I think I think that if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.900" end="00:25:53.810" style="s2">could if we could agree that you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:57.750" style="s2">this process we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.810" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">deeply one of caring and commitment and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.750" end="00:26:02.940" style="s2">cognition and I think that overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">your terms of effect and identity really</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.940" end="00:26:08.970" style="s2">deeply then is it possible and I like</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:12.809" style="s2">your point that it&#39;s only that fully</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.970" end="00:26:16.019" style="s2">embodied process</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.809" end="00:26:17.580" style="s2">that can get the discernment or at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.019" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">get good discernment between the bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.580" end="00:26:22.429" style="s2">environments and the good invariants</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:25.470" style="s2">what&#39;s the analog for the culture right</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.429" end="00:26:27.149" style="s2">because I think you&#39;re right if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.470" end="00:26:29.340" style="s2">taking a look at an individual cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.149" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">we can you know there&#39;s relevance</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.340" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">realization it&#39;s never cold calculation</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:36.210" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s about trying to zero</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:37.950" style="s2">in on what I should care about what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.210" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">should commit to what I there by</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.950" end="00:26:44.039" style="s2">identify with right and that that whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:45.960" style="s2">process is you know and insight is just</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.039" end="00:26:47.580" style="s2">moments where that&#39;s restructuring and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.960" end="00:26:49.649" style="s2">and that&#39;s what actually is helping me</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.580" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">pull apart the grid and variance from</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.649" end="00:26:54.629" style="s2">the batted variance within times of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.690" end="00:26:55.889" style="s2">development times of Kairos so Zach this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.629" end="00:26:58.340" style="s2">is a hard question but I&#39;m loving it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.889" end="00:27:01.529" style="s2">over to you what&#39;s the analog to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.340" end="00:27:04.860" style="s2">distributed cognition and collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.529" end="00:27:05.999" style="s2">intelligence right it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.860" end="00:27:08.669" style="s2">the first thing that came to mind was</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.999" end="00:27:16.590" style="s2">that something like a properly</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.669" end="00:27:21.720" style="s2">functioning religion yeah trying my best</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.590" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">not to buy away so I throw in one one</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.720" end="00:27:26.249" style="s2">word here that I got from Nora Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.700" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">which came to mind you&#39;re talking he</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.249" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">talked about warm data versus cold data</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.159" end="00:27:36.119" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.539" end="00:27:40.860" style="s2">warm data would be data that&#39;s embodied</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.119" end="00:27:42.990" style="s2">in well I mean III got to talk to Nora</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.860" end="00:27:45.149" style="s2">directly about this there&#39;s a video on</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.990" end="00:27:47.399" style="s2">my channel about that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.149" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">actually with tempte modeling and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.399" end="00:27:55.919" style="s2">think any Nora means she means she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.749" style="s2">dismissing the effect but she&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.919" end="00:27:59.669" style="s2">to point out that we&#39;re all always if</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.749" end="00:28:01.950" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me this ethnographically</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.669" end="00:28:03.779" style="s2">immersed and in the problems that really</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.950" end="00:28:06.659" style="s2">matter to us they&#39;re not just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.779" end="00:28:08.639" style="s2">problems out there there&#39;s there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.659" end="00:28:10.049" style="s2">are a complexity there a complexity in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.639" end="00:28:13.049" style="s2">their interactions between them is</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.049" end="00:28:15.450" style="s2">complex and so we the warm data is data</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.049" end="00:28:18.179" style="s2">that is much more contextually sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.450" end="00:28:21.350" style="s2">and comprehensive and more much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.179" end="00:28:24.090" style="s2">dynamically sensitive and responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.350" end="00:28:26.010" style="s2">that reality that&#39;s how I understood</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.090" end="00:28:28.139" style="s2">what she meant by warm data</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.010" end="00:28:30.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the effect part is being</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.139" end="00:28:31.950" style="s2">excluded but I think I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.600" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">that that&#39;s what she&#39;s primarily put her</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.950" end="00:28:35.669" style="s2">in your finger on I think she&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:38.309" style="s2">to put a finger on yeah well no no there</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.669" end="00:28:40.830" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the kind of data that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.309" end="00:28:42.809" style="s2">we are gathering when we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.830" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">the really important decisions the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.809" end="00:28:48.090" style="s2">decisions that involve commitment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.870" end="00:28:49.710" style="s2">essential commitment and transformation</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.090" end="00:28:51.510" style="s2">are warm data decisions they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.710" end="00:28:55.649" style="s2">data we can never get data that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.510" end="00:28:58.620" style="s2">coldly dis identified coldly abstracted</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.649" end="00:29:00.389" style="s2">and coldly separate from us when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.620" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">trying to wrestle on really important</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.389" end="00:29:05.429" style="s2">decisions time that&#39;s how I understood</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:07.889" style="s2">her to mean that okay well sorry Mike</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.429" end="00:29:12.419" style="s2">Chris John&#39;s question I just threw that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.889" end="00:29:14.309" style="s2">but but three seconds but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.419" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">idea of one data is exactly the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.309" end="00:29:17.970" style="s2">data processing if you&#39;ll allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:19.320" style="s2">stretch your metaphor that goes on in</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.970" end="00:29:20.970" style="s2">religion so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.320" end="00:29:23.519" style="s2">irrelevant what you said Andrew I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.970" end="00:29:26.190" style="s2">think it&#39;s great yeah that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.519" end="00:29:28.260" style="s2">interesting yeah I&#39;m out that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.190" end="00:29:30.330" style="s2">times you get Nagle&#39;s with the view from</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.260" end="00:29:32.850" style="s2">nowhere right like this is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.330" end="00:29:36.049" style="s2">actually no it&#39;s not science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.850" end="00:29:40.230" style="s2">scientists there everyone has a body and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.049" end="00:29:42.870" style="s2">has a family and mother who brought him</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.230" end="00:29:45.240" style="s2">forth screaming and the dinner they go</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.870" end="00:29:48.840" style="s2">to the bathroom and so the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.240" end="00:29:50.789" style="s2">scientist is primary that the science</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.840" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">follows from the scientists and you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.789" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">take that too far into the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:58.679" style="s2">critique we&#39;re all science becomes power</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:30:01.590" style="s2">and psychoanalyze away truth and to Bob</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.679" end="00:30:04.350" style="s2">you know biography but there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.590" end="00:30:06.059" style="s2">something really profound about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.350" end="00:30:08.789" style="s2">reorientation which has happened I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.059" end="00:30:10.230" style="s2">since the maybe the 90s it&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.789" end="00:30:11.610" style="s2">completed that&#39;s not well distributed</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.230" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">but there&#39;s been an awareness of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.610" end="00:30:17.309" style="s2">scholars that actually we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:19.620" style="s2">the human element within the knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.309" end="00:30:23.789" style="s2">system very seriously and that reduces</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.620" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">us down not reduces us but it it shifts</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.789" end="00:30:28.440" style="s2">the figure in ground so that we become</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">aware we become more aware of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.440" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:35.390" style="s2">emotional identity positions that were M</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:38.750" style="s2">as researchers and and and intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.390" end="00:30:42.070" style="s2">and things of that nature and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.750" end="00:30:45.260" style="s2">so in that sense it&#39;s similar to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.070" end="00:30:47.990" style="s2">admitting that there are religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.260" end="00:30:50.120" style="s2">aspects to even science right that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.990" end="00:30:52.460" style="s2">are investigating truth together and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.120" end="00:30:55.070" style="s2">that if we do it in an earnest enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.460" end="00:30:58.910" style="s2">manner know that we would end up finding</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.070" end="00:31:00.770" style="s2">things that we would kind of live by and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.910" end="00:31:03.050" style="s2">that would allow us as a group to then</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.770" end="00:31:04.670" style="s2">do the kind of concern to sermon you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.050" end="00:31:07.330" style="s2">talking about John like at the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.670" end="00:31:11.960" style="s2">level there have to be these shared</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.330" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">frameworks of value and identity and for</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.960" end="00:31:19.370" style="s2">shared frameworks of reality and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:21.740" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and we&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.370" end="00:31:23.420" style="s2">that cuts both ways right we know them</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.740" end="00:31:26.270" style="s2">bad stories of religion and we know my</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.420" end="00:31:30.260" style="s2">why modernity decided to try a different</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.270" end="00:31:34.280" style="s2">way of organizing people and it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.260" end="00:31:38.420" style="s2">important human evasions right right Zak</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.280" end="00:31:39.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s not like you&#39;re not yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.420" end="00:31:41.750" style="s2">you brought up you brought up the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.560" end="00:31:42.830" style="s2">analogy and say well what&#39;s that is for</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.750" end="00:31:46.400" style="s2">the collective intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.830" end="00:31:49.130" style="s2">well-functioning religion all right then</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.400" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">and I want to link it to your previous</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.130" end="00:31:53.720" style="s2">point I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t unlearned the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.720" end="00:31:57.980" style="s2">prepared you if I can put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:32:00.350" style="s2">you&#39;re not proposing religion in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.980" end="00:32:02.690" style="s2">nostalgic fashion you&#39;re not saying I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.350" end="00:32:04.430" style="s2">want to give up this is what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.690" end="00:32:06.830" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it right now you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.430" end="00:32:09.590" style="s2">to pull apart right the the invariance</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:11.180" style="s2">that we should hang on to from religion</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.590" end="00:32:13.190" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me this language and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.180" end="00:32:14.870" style="s2">discern which are the what are the bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.190" end="00:32:17.180" style="s2">invariants that we need to notice and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.870" end="00:32:19.400" style="s2">let go of so we can break through to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.180" end="00:32:21.620" style="s2">new developmental stage I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.400" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">you&#39;re doing concretely exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.620" end="00:32:27.020" style="s2">was asking for yeah and this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:29.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a decentering in PHH in terms and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.020" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">so you&#39;re revealing you&#39;re moving out</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.480" end="00:32:36.470" style="s2">from the surface to the depth and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.950" end="00:32:38.750" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.470" end="00:32:41.380" style="s2">what are the enduring structures that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.750" end="00:32:44.600" style="s2">need to preserve within the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.380" end="00:32:46.130" style="s2">and what&#39;s the form that the enduring</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.600" end="00:32:49.070" style="s2">structures take is they&#39;re integrated</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.130" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">into new life structures emerge in</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.070" end="00:32:52.610" style="s2">structures and so the moment now the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:54.020" style="s2">chaotic moment is one where all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.610" end="00:32:55.700" style="s2">structures are kind of coming undone</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.020" end="00:32:57.650" style="s2">which means we can gather the bests</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.700" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">enduring structures together moving</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.650" end="00:33:04.460" style="s2">forward yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:08.210" style="s2">interesting frame I like because this</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.460" end="00:33:10.460" style="s2">helps to make beautiful to use a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.210" end="00:33:12.770" style="s2">from Plato seven-letter the idea I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.460" end="00:33:14.060" style="s2">always rendering very in a very ugly</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.770" end="00:33:19.670" style="s2">fashion I was trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.060" end="00:33:21.230" style="s2">salvaging from these traditions he tries</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.670" end="00:33:23.660" style="s2">to find what was what&#39;s still good</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.230" end="00:33:25.220" style="s2">within which which has been discarded</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.660" end="00:33:27.410" style="s2">but I like what how we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.220" end="00:33:32.840" style="s2">it now I think it&#39;s much more refined</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.410" end="00:33:34.220" style="s2">and and much more interesting so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.840" end="00:33:36.140" style="s2">so that has something to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.220" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">living beauty you mentioned beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:45.740" style="s2">the living beauty yeah what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:48.550" style="s2">there rather than whatever is dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.740" end="00:33:51.140" style="s2">we&#39;re superficial or or dangerous or</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.550" end="00:33:52.850" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.140" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">way that&#39;s an excellent segue I do</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.850" end="00:33:58.850" style="s2">because I mean so if you&#39;ll allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.410" style="s2">talk about a bit you know UDL the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.850" end="00:34:01.730" style="s2">aesthetics of this are very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.410" end="00:34:02.630" style="s2">because the aesthetics is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.730" end="00:34:04.910" style="s2">where we&#39;re bridging</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.630" end="00:34:06.800" style="s2">you know between a lot of these things</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.910" end="00:34:08.030" style="s2">would we Karen thing about it when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.800" end="00:34:09.590" style="s2">when you&#39;re experiencing beauty this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.030" end="00:34:10.640" style="s2">the great photonic inside you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.590" end="00:34:13.370" style="s2">having one of your most profound</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.640" end="00:34:16.160" style="s2">cognitive insight but you&#39;re also having</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.370" end="00:34:18.170" style="s2">an education in the Platonic sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.160" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">you were of your Sensibility and when</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.170" end="00:34:22.910" style="s2">you care about right this is why Plato</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:25.580" style="s2">linked the understanding Beauty to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.910" end="00:34:28.220" style="s2">cultivation of virtue and so think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.580" end="00:34:30.290" style="s2">Ron&#39;s work on saving beauty and think</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.220" end="00:34:32.810" style="s2">about the aesthetics so he he talks</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.290" end="00:34:34.850" style="s2">about and you see how this is prescient</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.810" end="00:34:36.620" style="s2">along always before all of this hit we</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.850" end="00:34:38.660" style="s2">were in what he calls the aesthetics of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.620" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">the smooth we like things that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.660" end="00:34:45.220" style="s2">smooth and like objects that are smooth</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">and we like data production and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.220" end="00:34:48.349" style="s2">communication we want everything to run</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:50.839" style="s2">smooth</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.349" end="00:34:55.460" style="s2">and we want everybody&#39;s face and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.839" end="00:34:57.470" style="s2">smooth is a is an aesthetic that is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.460" end="00:35:00.019" style="s2">the tyranny of the projection of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.470" end="00:35:03.410" style="s2">subjective right the world is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.019" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">to be completely conducive to me and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.410" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">no way rupture or challenge me and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:10.339" style="s2">he when he actually says when I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:12.109" style="s2">he&#39;s right as he says we&#39;ve really that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.339" end="00:35:14.329" style="s2">really has lost that aesthetic has</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.109" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">really lost Beauty that&#39;s a simulacrum</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.329" end="00:35:20.239" style="s2">of beauty rather than beauty itself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:23.089" style="s2">which has always has edges to it and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.239" end="00:35:25.369" style="s2">always is as depth and even isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.089" end="00:35:28.039" style="s2">slightly painful and and well it should</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.369" end="00:35:33.589" style="s2">be caring and and yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.039" end="00:35:35.690" style="s2">okay describes the angel beauty is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.589" end="00:35:38.690" style="s2">terror that were basically barely able</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.690" end="00:35:41.989" style="s2">and that&#39;s so much I think relevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.690" end="00:35:44.329" style="s2">right now because you know beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.989" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">something that should I mean it should</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.329" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">strike you that&#39;s the verb that Plato</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:51.259" style="s2">uses repeatedly you&#39;re struck by it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:55.339" style="s2">it&#39;s and and the Greek is a very violent</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.259" end="00:35:58.460" style="s2">striking right and and the point about</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.339" end="00:36:02.719" style="s2">the lover and also the fall-off Ilia</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.460" end="00:36:08.599" style="s2">Sophia the lover of wisdom is the they</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.719" end="00:36:10.549" style="s2">have they have a capacity to do well</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.599" end="00:36:14.329" style="s2">these if he has any interest they can</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.549" end="00:36:16.910" style="s2">find they can they can accommodate to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.329" end="00:36:19.309" style="s2">the beauty and it&#39;s in and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.910" end="00:36:21.619" style="s2">distinguished from each other right the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.309" end="00:36:23.779" style="s2">ability to accommodate the beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.619" end="00:36:26.719" style="s2">precisely what makes it beautiful if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.779" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">can&#39;t if you can&#39;t accommodate you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.719" end="00:36:32.359" style="s2">have you don&#39;t have ah your terror right</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:36.109" style="s2">mm-hmm and so this this allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.359" end="00:36:37.900" style="s2">print another question right so think</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.109" end="00:36:40.779" style="s2">about the deep interconnection of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.900" end="00:36:45.170" style="s2">education of sensibility and aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.779" end="00:36:47.420" style="s2">within a religious community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.170" end="00:36:48.829" style="s2">functioning well here&#39;s what I think of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.420" end="00:36:49.999" style="s2">you know the work my friend and</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.829" end="00:36:51.759" style="s2">colleague Jonathan payaso</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.999" end="00:36:54.799" style="s2">where he goes back and he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.759" end="00:36:56.509" style="s2">re-educate people right into what all</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.799" end="00:36:58.279" style="s2">this symbolism was doing it you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.509" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">aesthetically in this deeper sense that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.279" end="00:37:05.049" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about seeing seeing the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:08.049" style="s2">aesthetics of people&#39;s experience as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.049" end="00:37:09.670" style="s2">fundamental thing sweep okay I&#39;ll put it</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.049" end="00:37:14.380" style="s2">in a put it in a sentence and I&#39;ll turn</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.670" end="00:37:16.750" style="s2">it to Zack as a question right I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.380" end="00:37:18.460" style="s2">you know children go through this the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.750" end="00:37:19.569" style="s2">limo with serious play I&#39;ve made that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.460" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">argument before you guys are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.569" end="00:37:24.700" style="s2">with it we can bring it up again</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:26.680" style="s2">but right I think and coupled to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.700" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">has to be an education that removes</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.680" end="00:37:34.599" style="s2">aesthetics out of entertainment and puts</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:38.170" style="s2">it back into education and because</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.599" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;s part that&#39;s a part of is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.170" end="00:37:42.940" style="s2">religious vision that Zack I think is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:45.160" style="s2">alluding to that we have lost the threat</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.940" end="00:37:49.329" style="s2">of we&#39;ve lost the threat of in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.160" end="00:37:56.289" style="s2">powerful way and so my question to Zack</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.329" end="00:37:58.299" style="s2">is that right do you think that so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.289" end="00:38:00.099" style="s2">is kind of self-deprecating for all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.299" end="00:38:02.619" style="s2">us as well do you think that the answer</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.099" end="00:38:04.030" style="s2">that we&#39;re looking for and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.619" end="00:38:07.210" style="s2">that as a simple answer you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.030" end="00:38:11.710" style="s2">mean a comprehensive trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.210" end="00:38:14.859" style="s2">response is going to come out more from</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.710" end="00:38:16.779" style="s2">an artistic set of people people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.859" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">are at home with the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.779" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">aspects of beauty then us intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">so I&#39;m getting a lot of emails from</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.700" end="00:38:32.950" style="s2">artists now that I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:34.869" style="s2">before a lot a lot more and they&#39;re dirt</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.950" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">they seem to be the people that rush</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.869" end="00:38:39.309" style="s2">into the Kairos better than anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:41.799" style="s2">because they one of the ways they</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.309" end="00:38:44.650" style="s2">systematize the error is if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.799" end="00:38:46.210" style="s2">me a verb a they beautify it which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.650" end="00:38:48.130" style="s2">the same thing as resolving it and are</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.210" end="00:38:50.020" style="s2">solving it in the intellectual fashion</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.130" end="00:38:55.329" style="s2">but they beautify it so that people can</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.020" end="00:38:56.440" style="s2">accommodate it and move into it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.329" end="00:38:58.390" style="s2">think what the answers gotta be of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.440" end="00:39:01.180" style="s2">course of course it&#39;s gonna come from</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.390" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">the artists you know I think Plato said</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:07.029" style="s2">though that often the artist doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:08.140" style="s2">know exactly what they&#39;re saying on but</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.029" end="00:39:09.460" style="s2">they&#39;re saying the truth the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.140" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">profound truth than the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.460" end="00:39:13.000" style="s2">could say but they they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:14.710" style="s2">exactly what they&#39;re saying because</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.000" end="00:39:15.770" style="s2">there&#39;s an inspiration there&#39;s a muse</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.710" end="00:39:19.010" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.770" end="00:39:21.730" style="s2">than the inside and so can I just agree</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.010" end="00:39:24.380" style="s2">maybe what they know is in the future</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.730" end="00:39:27.020" style="s2">they have an insight that is unpacked</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.380" end="00:39:29.030" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been unpacked yet so they</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.020" end="00:39:30.290" style="s2">have a prophetic as what I wanted is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.030" end="00:39:33.020" style="s2">prophetic yeah that the artist</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.290" end="00:39:35.540" style="s2">accredited since which you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.020" end="00:39:37.670" style="s2">access through mere intellectual idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.540" end="00:39:40.940" style="s2">that the artist is prophetic is I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.670" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">it&#39;s actually one of the it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.940" end="00:39:44.990" style="s2">one of the unspoken kind of Gospels of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:46.340" style="s2">modernity actually is that the artist is</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.990" end="00:39:48.860" style="s2">prophetic the only place where the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.340" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">Prophet still lives within the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.860" end="00:39:53.630" style="s2">deep disenchanted nature of modernity is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.900" style="s2">in the artist they get to be the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.630" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">prophetic voice and Emerson&#39;s poet comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.900" end="00:40:00.140" style="s2">to mind right for Amherst in the poet</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:01.730" style="s2">was much deeper for Emerson the poet was</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.140" end="00:40:05.870" style="s2">like Socrates was the greatest poet</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.730" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">Jesus was the greatest poet right and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.870" end="00:40:10.760" style="s2">you end up getting this notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:13.220" style="s2">artist is exactly the person to live to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.760" end="00:40:17.090" style="s2">and the german idealists ended up here</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.220" end="00:40:20.150" style="s2">too with romanticism and and they have</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.090" end="00:40:22.580" style="s2">their attempts to create a kind of uber</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.150" end="00:40:27.130" style="s2">christianity with all these symbolisms</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.580" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">moved also towards a kind of artist as</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.130" end="00:40:34.760" style="s2">social reform on guard and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:36.770" style="s2">look at artistic personality types from</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.760" end="00:40:43.010" style="s2">a psychological perspective you also see</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.770" end="00:40:45.500" style="s2">the sensitives and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.010" end="00:40:47.030" style="s2">aware of the war in heaven even as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.500" end="00:40:49.340" style="s2">simulations going and everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.030" end="00:40:51.560" style="s2">trekked that the world to normal the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.340" end="00:40:53.180" style="s2">artists are usually clued in which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.560" end="00:40:55.400" style="s2">why I hold artists usually it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.180" end="00:40:57.170" style="s2">kind of a vulnerable population which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.400" end="00:41:00.100" style="s2">to say they end up medicated or</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.170" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">institutionalized or addicted or</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.100" end="00:41:06.260" style="s2">unemployed underemployed miss employed</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:07.670" style="s2">so there&#39;s no Marge marginalize or</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.260" end="00:41:10.370" style="s2">systematic the marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.670" end="00:41:12.140" style="s2">modernity writes that into the artists</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.370" end="00:41:15.350" style="s2">that this is well you have to struggle</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.140" end="00:41:17.300" style="s2">to mean I justify it but you know other</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.350" end="00:41:20.090" style="s2">societies have revered their prophets</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.300" end="00:41:22.280" style="s2">although they&#39;ve been persecuted but so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.090" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">yeah so I think looking to the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.280" end="00:41:28.850" style="s2">and realizing that although we can see</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:29.810" style="s2">the intellectual synthesis clearly the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.850" end="00:41:31.810" style="s2">way for it to grab</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.810" end="00:41:36.470" style="s2">in the human heart is going to come from</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.810" end="00:41:39.170" style="s2">something more like an artistic movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.470" end="00:41:42.980" style="s2">and when you&#39;re thinking of the the move</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.170" end="00:41:45.350" style="s2">I think of from entertainment to culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.980" end="00:41:46.700" style="s2">right I think of the theater and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.350" end="00:41:48.920" style="s2">of the disappearance of the theater into</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.700" end="00:41:51.860" style="s2">the movie right now the potency and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.920" end="00:41:54.050" style="s2">possibility of the movie to do what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.860" end="00:41:57.070" style="s2">theater did for ancient Greece right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.050" end="00:41:59.500" style="s2">to show us this complex cathartic</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.070" end="00:42:01.820" style="s2">beautiful thing that allows us to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.500" end="00:42:02.660" style="s2">people in a new way together like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.820" end="00:42:05.420" style="s2">film could do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.660" end="00:42:09.490" style="s2">but I&#39;ve seen one that&#39;s time happy what</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.420" end="00:42:14.870" style="s2">I see is mostly an industry which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.490" end="00:42:16.730" style="s2">capturing attention and etc etc so yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.870" end="00:42:18.980" style="s2">part of this move out of entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.730" end="00:42:20.840" style="s2">and into culture is changing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.980" end="00:42:24.170" style="s2">incentive systems around cultural</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.840" end="00:42:26.210" style="s2">production and so that means moving the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.170" end="00:42:32.030" style="s2">artists out of marginal into something</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.210" end="00:42:35.900" style="s2">like supported right and through either</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.030" end="00:42:38.150" style="s2">federal or private reinvestment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.900" end="00:42:40.490" style="s2">a serious thinking now in this time of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.150" end="00:42:43.580" style="s2">crisis but a whole bunch of money&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.490" end="00:42:44.600" style="s2">moving around for better and for worse</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.580" end="00:42:46.610" style="s2">thinking about what the hell&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.600" end="00:42:50.260" style="s2">happen of the artists right what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.610" end="00:42:53.030" style="s2">hell is gonna happen to the to the young</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.260" end="00:42:56.540" style="s2">yeah the yeah the people who would give</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.030" end="00:42:59.470" style="s2">us those symbols and the effective</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.540" end="00:43:01.430" style="s2">grounding point so we can move around</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.470" end="00:43:02.810" style="s2">the answer that&#39;s kind of what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.430" end="00:43:04.610" style="s2">up when I&#39;m thinking about what you said</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.810" end="00:43:06.440" style="s2">John and I&#39;m agreeing with you enough to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.610" end="00:43:08.660" style="s2">say whoa yeah we actually get track that</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.440" end="00:43:12.260" style="s2">as priority and figure out in schools</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.660" end="00:43:15.140" style="s2">and colleges and cities how we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.260" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">support artists now it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.140" end="00:43:20.870" style="s2">problem this this this connects to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:24.080" style="s2">of the things that I actually wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.870" end="00:43:25.910" style="s2">talk to you guys about and both both of</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.080" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">you have been talking about stealing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.910" end="00:43:31.910" style="s2">culture I think that was John&#39;s phrase</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.100" end="00:43:35.870" style="s2">and your phrase Zak was in your talk you</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.910" end="00:43:38.630" style="s2">talked about being an outlaw right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.870" end="00:43:41.010" style="s2">being an outlaw not in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.630" end="00:43:44.619" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.010" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">immature adolescent you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.619" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">rule-breaking sense but being an outlaw</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:52.510" style="s2">and as the person who breaks the rules</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">so that the new rule can emerge or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.510" end="00:43:57.390" style="s2">new culture can emerge and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:44:00.280" style="s2">related somehow to this prophetic artist</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.390" end="00:44:03.609" style="s2">personally we&#39;re talking about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.280" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">was eventually killed by the state and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.609" end="00:44:08.349" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s relevant and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">prophets no prophet what did Jesus say</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.349" end="00:44:14.380" style="s2">no prophet is honored in his own home</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:17.170" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in it may mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.380" end="00:44:19.570" style="s2">answering that question are people like</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.170" end="00:44:23.530" style="s2">Socrates and especially Plato but also</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.570" end="00:44:26.080" style="s2">Platonist and people like Barfield and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.530" end="00:44:28.300" style="s2">you know courage and the the early post</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.080" end="00:44:31.570" style="s2">content that Zack was alluding to and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.300" end="00:44:33.849" style="s2">Goethe comes to mind as well mom these</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.570" end="00:44:36.070" style="s2">are the individuals right and it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.849" end="00:44:38.109" style="s2">interesting that when Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.070" end="00:44:40.810" style="s2">pronounced he gave one clear example</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.109" end="00:44:43.150" style="s2">that he stood behind as an example of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.810" end="00:44:45.369" style="s2">the uber mention it wasn&#39;t Napoleon that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.150" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t Hegel it was good the artist was</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.369" end="00:44:49.300" style="s2">good too but but the thing about Goethe</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:50.740" style="s2">and the thing about Socrates right is</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.300" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">you you baby</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.740" end="00:44:54.250" style="s2">let&#39;s do at least Plato because Plato</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">said that he made Socrates more</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.250" end="00:45:03.190" style="s2">beautiful let&#39;s take Plato because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:05.320" style="s2">the the if you&#39;ll allow me the artistry</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.190" end="00:45:07.980" style="s2">and the argumentation are completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.320" end="00:45:11.109" style="s2">interpenetrating so the artistry and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.980" end="00:45:13.150" style="s2">argumentation and the aspiration are all</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.109" end="00:45:15.849" style="s2">deeply interwoven together like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.150" end="00:45:16.510" style="s2">can&#39;t pull them apart like people you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.849" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">know I</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.510" end="00:45:20.109" style="s2">Zack probably had this too maybe you did</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.220" end="00:45:23.020" style="s2">Andrew in my education when they taught</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.109" end="00:45:24.460" style="s2">me Plato I was taught a great disservice</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.020" end="00:45:26.859" style="s2">because what was they would do is they</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.460" end="00:45:27.310" style="s2">would distract the arguments out of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.859" end="00:45:28.690" style="s2">drama</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.310" end="00:45:30.970" style="s2">remember the your reference to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.690" end="00:45:33.490" style="s2">theaters not it was right and they would</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.970" end="00:45:36.490" style="s2">and they would not even bringing up it</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.490" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">was it was marginalized to obscurity the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.490" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">aspiration all right so the artistry and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:44.020" style="s2">the aspiration were put aside dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">and then always held out is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.020" end="00:45:50.849" style="s2">argumentation but I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:54.010" style="s2">those kinds of people who can do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.849" end="00:45:58.900" style="s2">because I think they</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.010" end="00:46:00.700" style="s2">I think they&#39;re well I suspect I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.900" end="00:46:01.780" style="s2">trying to be very cautious it I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.700" end="00:46:03.310" style="s2">that they&#39;re more important than just</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.780" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">the artists right now I think the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.310" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">aesthetic is important and the artists</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:10.690" style="s2">are going to be do a lot for us but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:13.869" style="s2">think that the those individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.690" end="00:46:18.490" style="s2">make great art while also making new</p>

<p begin="00:46:18.490" end="00:46:23.560" style="s2">that so the three together I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.250" end="00:46:26.290" style="s2">they&#39;re the individuals and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.560" end="00:46:28.300" style="s2">interesting for me is I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.290" end="00:46:31.030" style="s2">to pick up on how do they communicate</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.300" end="00:46:32.619" style="s2">and how do they think with and through</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.030" end="00:46:35.260" style="s2">other people right</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.619" end="00:46:38.730" style="s2">the idea that dialectic is always this</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.260" end="00:46:42.880" style="s2">deeply interpenetration of argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.730" end="00:46:44.920" style="s2">aspiration and artistry and in which the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.880" end="00:46:46.690" style="s2">beauty and the truth seek this the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.920" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">beauty seeking and the truth seeking and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.690" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">the transformation seeking are all bound</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:55.480" style="s2">up together and so I&#39;m kind of looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:56.320" style="s2">to see and so here&#39;s another hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.480" end="00:46:57.790" style="s2">question for you is that because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.320" end="00:47:01.030" style="s2">been doing really well and answering</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.790" end="00:47:05.650" style="s2">them there no but I can make it concrete</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.030" end="00:47:07.450" style="s2">how do how do we educate for a good and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.650" end="00:47:11.820" style="s2">this is the question of building which</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.450" end="00:47:11.820" style="s2">is of course sourced and that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.910" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">when I had a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.900" end="00:47:17.530" style="s2">recently and he pointed to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:19.480" style="s2">building movement and this so this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.530" end="00:47:21.430" style="s2">important because it&#39;s not you toefl the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.480" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">Builder movement is intubated in</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.430" end="00:47:25.900" style="s2">instituted in the secular monastery</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:27.640" style="s2">retreats retreats that network in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.900" end="00:47:30.190" style="s2">Scandinavian countries to turn them from</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.640" end="00:47:31.840" style="s2">an authoritarian or grand societies into</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.190" end="00:47:34.810" style="s2">some of the best most advanced and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.840" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">happiest places on the earth so this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.810" end="00:47:39.550" style="s2">not fantasy this is not utopia this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:41.800" style="s2">doable it has been done there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.550" end="00:47:43.750" style="s2">historical piece and Thomas book the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.800" end="00:47:44.260" style="s2">Nord a secret lays it out really really</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.750" end="00:47:48.250" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.260" end="00:47:50.200" style="s2">yeah and Goethe and Humboldt and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.250" end="00:47:53.380" style="s2">gather the immediate post Conti in</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.200" end="00:47:55.180" style="s2">milieu it was that sense of and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.380" end="00:47:56.770" style="s2">right to correct me there that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.180" end="00:48:00.040" style="s2">it&#39;s all three it&#39;s the good deterrent</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.770" end="00:48:02.859" style="s2">beautifully United and so complex symbol</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.040" end="00:48:04.030" style="s2">right and that in our society someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.859" end="00:48:05.530" style="s2">who&#39;s capable of doing that probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.030" end="00:48:08.470" style="s2">looks more like an artist</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.530" end="00:48:09.640" style="s2">scientists as Girja did right but as</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.470" end="00:48:11.740" style="s2">many people know correct it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.640" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">a totally badass scientist and this was</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.740" end="00:48:15.730" style="s2">real rough Steiners many people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:18.250" style="s2">know this Rudolf Steiners first work was</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:20.920" style="s2">actually in the archives of Goethe</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.250" end="00:48:23.830" style="s2">looking at his scientific work and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.920" end="00:48:26.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a richness there but yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.830" end="00:48:31.630" style="s2">point being that yeah the what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.140" end="00:48:34.180" style="s2">looking for is that complex truly after</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.630" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">modern right to the the differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.180" end="00:48:39.340" style="s2">of the value spheres separating art from</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:40.900" style="s2">science from morality right the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.340" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">that they need to be reintegrated in</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.900" end="00:48:49.570" style="s2">some new form that&#39;s the that&#39;s the in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:52.090" style="s2">sense the holy grail of of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.570" end="00:48:55.480" style="s2">West that the only way out of this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.090" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">the somehow reintegrate these these</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.480" end="00:49:00.370" style="s2">values spheres and to somehow find forms</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">of expression and communication and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.370" end="00:49:05.110" style="s2">interaction that represent a new merger</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:06.490" style="s2">of them not a regression back to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.110" end="00:49:08.460" style="s2">medieval system where they refused</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.490" end="00:49:10.660" style="s2">together right where you couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.460" end="00:49:11.890" style="s2">that&#39;s their work because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.660" end="00:49:13.060" style="s2">many you can&#39;t talk about the planets</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.890" end="00:49:14.830" style="s2">because we already know because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.830" end="00:49:18.060" style="s2">can&#39;t be some of it so like the dogmatic</p>

<p begin="00:49:18.060" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">pre-modern undifferentiated than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.010" end="00:49:24.760" style="s2">differentiated modernity and then Weber</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.110" style="s2">lays out the problem right the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.760" end="00:49:28.360" style="s2">technocrats without heart and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.110" end="00:49:30.280" style="s2">aesthetic artists without any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.360" end="00:49:33.820" style="s2">ethics and the fragmentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.280" end="00:49:35.350" style="s2">unity dimensional man and so always the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.820" end="00:49:38.680" style="s2">quest has been there&#39;s free integration</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.350" end="00:49:40.570" style="s2">and one way to think about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.680" end="00:49:43.090" style="s2">is actually also as a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.570" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">socio-economic thing here that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.090" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">we need to heal certain underlying</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:50.140" style="s2">social structures to allow for those</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:51.370" style="s2">forms of complex identity formation back</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.140" end="00:49:53.290" style="s2">to the question of Education which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.370" end="00:49:55.150" style="s2">where you&#39;re moving this because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.290" end="00:49:58.570" style="s2">caricature of the artist right now is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.150" end="00:50:00.460" style="s2">some wounded degenerate tight who&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.570" end="00:50:02.040" style="s2">of an egomaniac and doesn&#39;t get along</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.460" end="00:50:05.770" style="s2">with the rest of society and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.040" end="00:50:09.460" style="s2">narcissistic and and the scientists and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.770" end="00:50:11.230" style="s2">the scientists the and he&#39;s got no</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.460" end="00:50:13.240" style="s2">emotions and he might as well be a robot</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.230" end="00:50:16.090" style="s2">right and the politician is cutthroat</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.240" end="00:50:17.660" style="s2">and the businessman has no morals or</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.090" end="00:50:20.030" style="s2">aesthetic sense and so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.660" end="00:50:22.190" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s each person with this</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.030" end="00:50:23.960" style="s2">fragmented so can I say that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.190" end="00:50:27.319" style="s2">artist is actually the total person</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.960" end="00:50:30.500" style="s2">right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not being an artist</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.319" end="00:50:32.390" style="s2">as a specialized activity in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.500" end="00:50:35.270" style="s2">being an artist is is what we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.390" end="00:50:37.789" style="s2">sort of the total person meant to be on</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.270" end="00:50:40.670" style="s2">some level right whether you actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.789" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">art or not if we&#39;re using artists in</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.670" end="00:50:43.789" style="s2">that sense that we were where the artist</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:46.789" style="s2">is the one who finds a way to make a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.789" end="00:50:49.750" style="s2">life that reunites the fragmented value</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.789" end="00:50:52.819" style="s2">spheres of modernity right that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.750" end="00:50:54.049" style="s2">like I said the Emersonian poet who</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.819" end="00:50:55.910" style="s2">integrates the good the true and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.049" end="00:51:00.020" style="s2">beautiful if that&#39;s the artist talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.910" end="00:51:03.500" style="s2">about then yes but again the the artist</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.020" end="00:51:08.660" style="s2">of modernity right the mad genius like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.500" end="00:51:13.160" style="s2">derelict marginalized artists is as much</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.660" end="00:51:15.170" style="s2">of a kind of character as the modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.160" end="00:51:17.630" style="s2">businessman or the modern politician yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.170" end="00:51:20.089" style="s2">also stopped from having aesthetic sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.630" end="00:51:23.089" style="s2">or an ethical sense and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.089" end="00:51:28.730" style="s2">just that sense again the whole person</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.089" end="00:51:32.450" style="s2">where you can essentially not be</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.730" end="00:51:35.660" style="s2">fragmented at such a root level</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.450" end="00:51:40.190" style="s2">alongside clefts and identity as the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.660" end="00:51:42.200" style="s2">good determine the beautiful and I get</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.190" end="00:51:44.750" style="s2">the sense that like when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.200" end="00:51:47.000" style="s2">the other day I mentioned poetry and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.750" end="00:51:49.190" style="s2">John kind of jumped and said no because</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.000" end="00:51:52.849" style="s2">of the way people think of a poet today</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.190" end="00:51:57.349" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s this contempt for poetry</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.849" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">right and then maybe this event that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.349" end="00:52:02.569" style="s2">happening right now when people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">stuck in their houses etc etc maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.569" end="00:52:07.490" style="s2">will start to see a little bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:11.059" style="s2">value of that from the poetic poetry are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.490" end="00:52:12.410" style="s2">oh I agree I think that crisis it does</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.059" end="00:52:14.930" style="s2">two things and they play off against</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.410" end="00:52:17.690" style="s2">each other I mean it creates Dom aside</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.930" end="00:52:19.309" style="s2">it because people connection it brings</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.160" end="00:52:29.150" style="s2">many ways and we&#39;re already seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.539" end="00:52:30.859" style="s2">it exacerbates the meaning crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.150" end="00:52:31.600" style="s2">predict we&#39;re going to see a mental</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.839" end="00:55:32.560" style="s2">afforded him insight and then he</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.089" end="00:55:32.800" style="s2">proposed you&#39;ll see where I&#39;m going with</p>

<p begin="00:55:32.800" end="00:55:39.310" style="s2">you posts he those two he said what we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.460" end="00:55:42.790" style="s2">really need because the first emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.310" end="00:55:46.359" style="s2">subjectivity right autonomy the second</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.790" end="00:55:49.089" style="s2">got localizes everything in objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.359" end="00:55:51.849" style="s2">right but he said there&#39;s a third which</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.089" end="00:55:54.849" style="s2">is the enemy and this is being god</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.849" end="00:55:55.990" style="s2">governed right and and this brings us</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.849" end="00:55:58.750" style="s2">back again to the well-functioning</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.990" end="00:56:01.780" style="s2">religion the idea is there are a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.750" end="00:56:03.940" style="s2">form because when people feel called by</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.780" end="00:56:06.430" style="s2">God they don&#39;t feel that they&#39;re being</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.430" end="00:56:10.650" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re acting autonomously</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.660" end="00:56:13.420" style="s2">they feel it&#39;s if they feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.650" end="00:56:14.890" style="s2">simultaneously that they are moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.420" end="00:56:16.869" style="s2">they&#39;re being moved by something beyond</p>

<p begin="00:56:18.430" end="00:56:26.080" style="s2">realize themselves in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.609" end="00:56:29.650" style="s2">and so I think part I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.080" end="00:56:31.420" style="s2">deep reason by and to why you brought</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.650" end="00:56:35.109" style="s2">this up and I think it&#39;s even a deep</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.109" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">well-functioning religion like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.780" end="00:56:43.450" style="s2">going to break out of the fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:47.530" style="s2">we have to challenge the normativity</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.450" end="00:56:50.920" style="s2">that drives the fragmentation which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.530" end="00:56:54.250" style="s2">the absolute value radiation of autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.920" end="00:56:57.670" style="s2">as the final way in which all</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.250" end="00:56:59.230" style="s2">normativity is generated no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.670" end="00:57:00.940" style="s2">to give in to hitter on me and say</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.230" end="00:57:03.160" style="s2">what we need is the strong man and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.940" end="00:57:05.050" style="s2">authoritarian structure and Tillich was</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.160" end="00:57:07.030" style="s2">really playing with the idea that what</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.050" end="00:57:10.420" style="s2">Christianity was trying to offer people</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.030" end="00:57:12.250" style="s2">was the Animus um normativity and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.420" end="00:57:14.500" style="s2">would break us out and we help to</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.250" end="00:57:17.140" style="s2">reunite us as an entire person</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.500" end="00:57:20.200" style="s2">well that&#39;s very abstract and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.140" end="00:57:23.080" style="s2">exactly what Zak was talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.200" end="00:57:25.210" style="s2">when you talk about the unique self</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.080" end="00:57:28.660" style="s2">Symphony I have it written down here in</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.210" end="00:57:32.830" style="s2">a mystical body of Christ it&#39;s breaking</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.660" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">out modern idea of self right our modern</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.830" end="00:57:38.080" style="s2">idea of self into something else you</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.080" end="00:57:44.890" style="s2">sure I understand what I want to reform</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.460" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what the back was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.890" end="00:57:49.540" style="s2">exactly Zacks yes concept and he also</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re also said that&#39;s the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.540" end="00:57:55.780" style="s2">body of Christ right yes yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:58.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.780" end="00:57:59.710" style="s2">conventional way in but yes eventually</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.060" end="00:58:01.900" style="s2">is in one consistent mystical body of</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.710" end="00:58:03.400" style="s2">Christ and it was interesting here so we</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.900" end="00:58:05.369" style="s2">can go back to the developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.400" end="00:58:09.190" style="s2">because that stack you just ran from</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.369" end="00:58:12.250" style="s2">heteronomous to autonomous - what was</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.460" end="00:58:24.070" style="s2">that that stacks very closely to the pre</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.920" end="01:06:57.540" style="s2">us it&#39;s also connected to the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.170" end="01:07:00.090" style="s2">intelligibility and even reality are</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.540" end="01:07:02.280" style="s2">unfolding and that that&#39;s ultimately I</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.090" end="01:07:06.060" style="s2">think why we belong to it rather than it</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.280" end="01:07:09.870" style="s2">belonging to us and so part of what I</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.060" end="01:07:17.610" style="s2">think the sage artists can do is in is</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.870" end="01:07:21.090" style="s2">invoke do logos and invoke that as you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.610" end="01:07:23.400" style="s2">know the thing the the sort of trans</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.090" end="01:07:25.290" style="s2">systemic thing that allows us to bridge</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.400" end="01:07:28.710" style="s2">between the normativity is an important</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.290" end="01:07:30.540" style="s2">way and I think the so I want to throw</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.710" end="01:07:33.540" style="s2">in that one of the things that has</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.540" end="01:07:37.020" style="s2">supported the autonomy and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.540" end="01:07:38.220" style="s2">subjectivity you know model and and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.020" end="01:07:39.780" style="s2">and then we have this thing called</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.220" end="01:07:41.790" style="s2">authenticity which isn&#39;t part of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.780" end="01:07:45.330" style="s2">sense it just basically means sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.790" end="01:07:49.260" style="s2">celebrating your autonomy right um but</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.330" end="01:07:50.460" style="s2">one of one of the one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.260" end="01:07:57.900" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.460" end="01:08:05.849" style="s2">right is this idea that in the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.900" end="01:08:13.290" style="s2">and in the dialectic we have access to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.849" end="01:08:15.420" style="s2">right a way like when you when you read</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.290" end="01:08:18.330" style="s2">when you read the dialogues it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.420" end="01:08:20.810" style="s2">just argumentation that&#39;s in competition</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.330" end="01:08:23.670" style="s2">ways of life are being brought into</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.810" end="01:08:26.759" style="s2">competition but not just in an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.670" end="01:08:27.630" style="s2">fashion they&#39;re being regulated but is</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.759" end="01:08:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the right word there being</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.630" end="01:08:32.790" style="s2">regulated by the logos and everybody has</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.960" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">to be willing to follow the logos which</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.790" end="01:08:38.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just drifting subjectively</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">it means you know answering the call</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.549" end="01:08:43.859" style="s2">being responsive to the way it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.520" end="01:08:47.370" style="s2">on a life of its own and then it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.859" end="01:08:49.529" style="s2">polarity is it&#39;s not grounded in us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.370" end="01:08:51.870" style="s2">grounded between us and each other and</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.529" end="01:08:54.509" style="s2">the end our culture of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.870" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">and ultimately the world in which that</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.509" end="01:09:00.270" style="s2">culture is embedded like the logos the</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.359" end="01:09:03.750" style="s2">logos exemplifies the normativity of our</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.270" end="01:09:06.900" style="s2">embeddedness Animax it for us and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.750" end="01:09:08.700" style="s2">think that is a way in which linked with</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.900" end="01:09:12.779" style="s2">sort of post conventional thinking it</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.700" end="01:09:15.060" style="s2">can help us to get the kind of Fionna</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.779" end="01:09:21.420" style="s2">--mess normativity that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.060" end="01:09:23.640" style="s2">talk about the you know well we talked</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.420" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">about this and Zack Zack because you use</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.640" end="01:09:29.370" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s something sacred or perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:30.930" style="s2">even divine about the logos that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.370" end="01:09:33.719" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get it to take</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.930" end="01:09:35.370" style="s2">the role the Fionna the Fiona might roll</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.719" end="01:09:36.750" style="s2">that till it was 22 words</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.370" end="01:09:39.239" style="s2">did that make sense I was struggling</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.750" end="01:09:40.440" style="s2">that what I did know I mean it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.239" end="01:09:41.759" style="s2">a beautiful international essentially</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.440" end="01:09:42.839" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing is that this artists</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.759" end="01:09:45.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about this like</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.839" end="01:09:47.160" style="s2">Gertie and RDS who integrates the value</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.750" end="01:09:49.020" style="s2">spheres what they&#39;re creating their</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.160" end="01:09:50.790" style="s2">words like they&#39;re they&#39;re inviting us</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.020" end="01:09:53.330" style="s2">actually to something into sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.790" end="01:09:56.460" style="s2">ritual some kind of ritual of</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.330" end="01:09:58.389" style="s2">interaction and communication where the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.460" end="01:10:01.080" style="s2">logos is revealed between us</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.389" end="01:10:04.300" style="s2">right yeah the artist needs to create</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.080" end="01:10:05.469" style="s2">our collective yeah form it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.300" end="01:10:07.270" style="s2">perform that&#39;s why Theatre is so</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.469" end="01:10:09.670" style="s2">interesting and a theater that would</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.270" end="01:10:12.520" style="s2">break down that fourth wall and engage</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.670" end="01:10:14.739" style="s2">the audience you know and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.520" end="01:10:16.389" style="s2">always hints in postmodern art that</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.739" end="01:10:19.210" style="s2">there was something trying to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.389" end="01:10:21.280" style="s2">that would actually embrace the audience</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.210" end="01:10:25.090" style="s2">and blur the line between the art and</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.280" end="01:10:28.750" style="s2">non-art though and essentially Rhys ACK</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.090" end="01:10:31.330" style="s2">realized all of life by casting the veil</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.750" end="01:10:32.980" style="s2">of art across all things and so that</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.330" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">notion that the artists were looking for</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.980" end="01:10:38.469" style="s2">someone who invites us into a new ritual</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:42.520" style="s2">and way of being worth through it we</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.469" end="01:10:44.889" style="s2">can&#39;t help but be swept into the logo</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.520" end="01:10:47.710" style="s2">he&#39;s essentially and that were going</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.889" end="01:10:49.900" style="s2">full circle into the logos mysticism</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.710" end="01:10:53.530" style="s2">right of the the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.900" end="01:10:56.469" style="s2">rooted in the Neoplatonic stuff and yet</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.530" end="01:11:01.449" style="s2">a sense that there&#39;s a way to there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.469" end="01:11:03.250" style="s2">way to create a human civilization so</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.449" end="01:11:07.300" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of the tightness here in</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.250" end="01:11:09.730" style="s2">particular he he almost built a city yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.300" end="01:11:11.230" style="s2">big novel is it yeah exactly he must</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.730" end="01:11:12.909" style="s2">build the city and so he was in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.230" end="01:11:15.730" style="s2">kind of civilizational design mindset</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.909" end="01:11:18.010" style="s2">from a deeply meta philosophical the a</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.730" end="01:11:20.650" style="s2">platonic video and to my sense is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.010" end="01:11:23.860" style="s2">yeah in this such a society there would</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.650" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">be some kind of and again when you think</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.860" end="01:11:28.690" style="s2">of properly functioning religion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:30.820" style="s2">not just like the books and stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.690" end="01:11:32.409" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a building and we all</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.820" end="01:11:33.969" style="s2">get there and we&#39;re in it together and</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.409" end="01:11:36.940" style="s2">we do something and what that something</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.969" end="01:11:39.369" style="s2">is is a ritual that would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.940" end="01:11:41.590" style="s2">tremendously beautiful and that would</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.369" end="01:11:43.989" style="s2">then the conception of it would be as</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.590" end="01:11:45.940" style="s2">you&#39;re describing John it would be not</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.989" end="01:11:48.730" style="s2">us all looking at one thing like some</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.940" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">medieval ritual but in fact this moving</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.730" end="01:11:54.489" style="s2">between us of the Holy Spirit and of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:56.170" style="s2">dialogue goes yeah where the evidence is</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.489" end="01:11:57.940" style="s2">clear just by that were fact we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.170" end="01:12:00.070" style="s2">together looking one other&#39;s eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.940" end="01:12:01.810" style="s2">that&#39;s what can happen sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.070" end="01:12:02.980" style="s2">why a a works and that&#39;s why circling</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.810" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">works a bunch of other things work</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.980" end="01:12:07.570" style="s2">because you just it descends it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:09.190" style="s2">you&#39;re looking between the eyes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.570" end="01:12:12.630" style="s2">a self-evident how</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.190" end="01:12:17.050" style="s2">in the experience personhood and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.630" end="01:12:18.790" style="s2">co-relating and it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.050" end="01:12:20.620" style="s2">they always say you&#39;re selling water by</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.790" end="01:12:22.180" style="s2">the well or selling water by the river</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.620" end="01:12:24.670" style="s2">or something like that I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.180" end="01:12:27.910" style="s2">one of those things you know and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.670" end="01:12:30.340" style="s2">it&#39;s right there and I like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.910" end="01:12:31.960" style="s2">that the logos is building something</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.340" end="01:12:36.130" style="s2">like you said building a city or a</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.960" end="01:12:38.740" style="s2">Patronus is building a city that strikes</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.130" end="01:12:41.380" style="s2">me as that&#39;s the thing that is building</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.740" end="01:12:47.350" style="s2">the city of God is the logos or you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.380" end="01:12:49.570" style="s2">if we got yeah incredible terms there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.350" end="01:12:50.830" style="s2">two myths to identification crisis</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.570" end="01:12:52.240" style="s2">identified with the body of the church</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.830" end="01:12:54.940" style="s2">but Christ is also identified with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.240" end="01:12:56.890" style="s2">logos of God right and it&#39;s because I</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.940" end="01:12:58.840" style="s2">said because he media&#39;s between them and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.890" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">he creates ways of being</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.840" end="01:13:02.620" style="s2">he was the followers of Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:04.270" style="s2">were the followers of Jesus were</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.620" end="01:13:06.160" style="s2">originally not called Christians that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.270" end="01:13:08.350" style="s2">was an insult they originally called</p>

<p begin="01:15:26.010" end="01:15:30.040" style="s2">wanted to say how much Zach said I think</p>

<p begin="01:15:34.180" end="01:15:39.370" style="s2">that was grounded in sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:41.560" style="s2">the emergence of subjectivity which is</p>

<p begin="01:16:37.510" end="01:16:40.749" style="s2">it but honesty isn&#39;t a place I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.369" end="01:16:42.909" style="s2">to get to I can now say okay I&#39;m done</p>

<p begin="01:16:59.769" end="01:17:04.329" style="s2">to my mind like Moses never gets to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.570" end="01:17:06.400" style="s2">the promised land and John the Baptist</p>

<p begin="01:17:09.699" end="01:17:14.170" style="s2">something on faith because it will never</p>

<p begin="01:17:14.170" end="01:17:19.269" style="s2">that&#39;s why don&#39;t perfection right right</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.570" end="01:17:22.539" style="s2">that&#39;s right and but ultimately we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.269" end="01:17:25.300" style="s2">which find the faith is always affording</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.539" end="01:17:28.239" style="s2">the emergence precisely because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.300" end="01:17:30.219" style="s2">only in the logos of emergence that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.239" end="01:17:31.389" style="s2">move into post conventionality that we</p>

<p begin="01:17:31.389" end="01:17:37.269" style="s2">that we can find the resources to</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.539" end="01:17:40.510" style="s2">respond to Kairos it&#39;s also that that</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.269" end="01:17:43.510" style="s2">the you can&#39;t write you can&#39;t make it a</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.510" end="01:17:46.689" style="s2">is going to appear in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.070" end="01:17:48.699" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.689" end="01:17:52.599" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna happen in fact taking</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.699" end="01:17:55.329" style="s2">that stance will kill it right will kill</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.599" end="01:17:57.400" style="s2">it completely well it won&#39;t show up it</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.329" end="01:17:59.709" style="s2">won&#39;t show up sorry Zach you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.400" end="01:18:01.719" style="s2">say something no I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.709" end="01:18:03.219" style="s2">vibing on it and I&#39;m thinking with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.719" end="01:18:05.320" style="s2">ideal notion and I&#39;m thinking of Tillich</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.219" end="01:18:08.199" style="s2">- in the his notion of idolatry right</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.320" end="01:18:09.519" style="s2">just yeah you invest something with</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.199" end="01:18:12.760" style="s2">infinite worth it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.519" end="01:18:14.679" style="s2">infinite and the proper ideal would be</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.760" end="01:18:16.150" style="s2">infinite that you precisely couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.679" end="01:18:18.010" style="s2">achieve it in this life and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.150" end="01:18:19.989" style="s2">you&#39;ve adopted it as your ideal on some</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.010" end="01:18:22.239" style="s2">of the most compelling religious ideals</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.989" end="01:18:24.340" style="s2">have that quality like Buddhahood for</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:26.229" style="s2">example like media which contains a</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.340" end="01:18:28.300" style="s2">whole bunch of qualities that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.229" end="01:18:31.539" style="s2">unlikely to achieve in this lifetime but</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.300" end="01:18:33.039" style="s2">wish you were strong right again even</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.539" end="01:18:35.229" style="s2">the love of wisdom for luck finally Oh</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.039" end="01:18:36.969" style="s2">Sophia you are always in love with</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.229" end="01:18:38.920" style="s2">wisdom because you would never be a God</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.969" end="01:18:41.709" style="s2">you would never be perfectly wise right</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.920" end="01:18:44.510" style="s2">yeah exactly answer that that it is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.709" end="01:18:46.520" style="s2">infinitely pursuable like asymptotic</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.510" end="01:18:51.050" style="s2">throughout life basically it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.520" end="01:18:54.260" style="s2">notion of the of the ideal which is you</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.050" end="01:18:57.440" style="s2">know very different from other ways of</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.260" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">having motivation and so the question of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:02.750" style="s2">the how the post conventional identity</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.360" end="01:19:05.150" style="s2">is ideal driven where has many forms of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.750" end="01:19:09.200" style="s2">conventional identity or goal driven is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.150" end="01:19:10.190" style="s2">an important statement and as we know</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.200" end="01:19:11.840" style="s2">for most of the happiness research</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.190" end="01:19:14.810" style="s2">actually when you meet your goal watch</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.840" end="01:19:18.500" style="s2">out because that&#39;s when the depression</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.810" end="01:19:20.990" style="s2">sets and often people winning gold</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.500" end="01:19:22.280" style="s2">medals and and super bowls and then get</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.990" end="01:19:25.400" style="s2">suicidal afterwards because they</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.280" end="01:19:30.200" style="s2">actually did it whereas the ideal is</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.400" end="01:19:35.540" style="s2">actually infinitely renewable like</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.200" end="01:19:37.430" style="s2">resource of identity construction you</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.540" end="01:19:40.700" style="s2">know right it if it in finite game it</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.430" end="01:19:42.680" style="s2">right yeah courses you know that follows</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.700" end="01:19:45.830" style="s2">up on his previous book the religious</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.680" end="01:19:47.600" style="s2">case against belief and you know playing</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.830" end="01:19:51.680" style="s2">a finite game versus playing an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.600" end="01:19:56.150" style="s2">game and I think playing in a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.680" end="01:19:58.790" style="s2">serious play like playing a musical</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.150" end="01:20:02.330" style="s2">instrument rather than fooling around or</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.790" end="01:20:04.550" style="s2">yeah yeah or jazz where you jazz is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.330" end="01:20:07.430" style="s2">post formal post conventional thing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.550" end="01:20:08.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t do jazz unless you&#39;ve done you</p>
