<p begin="00:00:32.809" end="00:00:36.350" style="s2">Chapel perilous is a space where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.730" end="00:00:37.940" style="s2">trained to face the uncertainties of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.350" end="00:00:40.519" style="s2">world where we push the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.940" end="00:00:42.970" style="s2">who we are and how we think so it fits</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.519" end="00:00:47.269" style="s2">in real the perfectly here at the store</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.970" end="00:00:48.830" style="s2">so I see Chapel perilous I was talking a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.269" end="00:00:50.589" style="s2">little bit about this last week but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.830" end="00:00:54.049" style="s2">I&#39;ve had time to think about it now and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.589" end="00:00:56.390" style="s2">I conceived of this space as a space</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.049" end="00:00:59.780" style="s2">where we address one of the core</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.390" end="00:01:01.339" style="s2">problems that we as humans have and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.780" end="00:01:02.479" style="s2">one of those problems that we don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.339" end="00:01:05.780" style="s2">at directly because it&#39;s bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.479" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">intimidating a bit scary perhaps but</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.780" end="00:01:08.840" style="s2">once you notice that you see it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:12.200" style="s2">everywhere I think that problem is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.840" end="00:01:13.909" style="s2">intolerance of uncertainty and like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.200" end="00:01:16.220" style="s2">said once you start looking for it there</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.909" end="00:01:17.780" style="s2">it is you see people so certain they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.220" end="00:01:19.100" style="s2">right that they&#39;re absolute dicks to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.780" end="00:01:21.230" style="s2">each other on the internet and in real</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.100" end="00:01:23.450" style="s2">life sometimes you see all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.230" end="00:01:24.830" style="s2">individual psychological neuroses and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.450" end="00:01:27.230" style="s2">then there&#39;s this big you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.830" end="00:01:30.380" style="s2">society-wide existential meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.230" end="00:01:33.860" style="s2">it seems to be going around but for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.380" end="00:01:35.810" style="s2">it&#39;s personal I&#39;m one of those people</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.860" end="00:01:37.909" style="s2">who really likes to be in control of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.810" end="00:01:41.330" style="s2">things I like things to make sense I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.909" end="00:01:43.880" style="s2">like order I like I like control and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.330" end="00:01:46.700" style="s2">know this is not a realistic way to live</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.880" end="00:01:48.590" style="s2">my life obviously because the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.700" end="00:01:51.050" style="s2">isn&#39;t under my control and often it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.590" end="00:01:53.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to make much sense but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.050" end="00:01:55.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t realise quite how unflattering</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.060" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">this sort of perspective looked on me</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.880" end="00:02:00.500" style="s2">until I heard myself described in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:02.120" style="s2">pages of Peter&#39;s diary well on his</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.500" end="00:02:05.060" style="s2">online journal I&#39;ll keep what I read in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.120" end="00:02:06.950" style="s2">his private Diaries private see he</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.060" end="00:02:09.289" style="s2">described people like me as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.950" end="00:02:14.299" style="s2">rationalist to ameliorate their anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.289" end="00:02:16.010" style="s2">through control yeah that&#39;s done he</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.299" end="00:02:17.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t say people like Rebecca but</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.010" end="00:02:21.890" style="s2">that&#39;s how I interpreted it because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.390" end="00:02:23.719" style="s2">a masochist so I decided I need a place</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.890" end="00:02:25.579" style="s2">to work on this I need a place to sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.719" end="00:02:26.900" style="s2">of integrate those classic lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.579" end="00:02:28.819" style="s2">the Stoics that sounds so good when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.900" end="00:02:29.480" style="s2">read them so but does actually bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.819" end="00:02:33.110" style="s2">them into my</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.480" end="00:02:35.659" style="s2">if they thought psycho technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.110" end="00:02:37.220" style="s2">reduce my intolerance to uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.659" end="00:02:40.489" style="s2">things would be a lot easier to deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.220" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">with and of course I need people to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.489" end="00:02:45.140" style="s2">on this journey with because it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:47.810" style="s2">to do these things alone so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.140" end="00:02:51.610" style="s2">you guys I mean this is us and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.810" end="00:02:53.870" style="s2">Chapel perilous as I said this is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.610" end="00:02:56.180" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve been mulling</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.870" end="00:02:57.319" style="s2">over for a while but the term travel</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.180" end="00:02:59.239" style="s2">Paris only popped into my head a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.319" end="00:03:01.159" style="s2">fortnight ago so I&#39;ve been going on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.239" end="00:03:02.569" style="s2">sort of you know like a corkboard</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.159" end="00:03:04.549" style="s2">adventure I don&#39;t actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.569" end="00:03:06.019" style="s2">corkboard out but that&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.549" end="00:03:08.120" style="s2">in my head the court with all the string</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.019" end="00:03:10.340" style="s2">and the pins and everything so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.120" end="00:03:12.349" style="s2">take you through what I figured out so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.340" end="00:03:14.780" style="s2">far about what chapel palaces and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.349" end="00:03:16.459" style="s2">start with the history of the term that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.780" end="00:03:17.720" style="s2">kind of makes sense to me and I hope it</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.459" end="00:03:20.540" style="s2">makes sense to you guys at least a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.720" end="00:03:22.579" style="s2">little bit of sense let&#39;s see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.540" end="00:03:26.359" style="s2">show you what I&#39;ve been up to what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.579" end="00:03:29.569" style="s2">been thinking about here we go you guys</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.359" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">can all see that right that is the wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.569" end="00:03:34.880" style="s2">wood and the wild wood is a term that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">used to describe Britain&#39;s primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.880" end="00:03:40.880" style="s2">forests so the primary forests are you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">know those ones that have been there</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:44.840" style="s2">ever since the beginning I suppose and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:47.569" style="s2">that&#39;s where all those classic Grail</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.840" end="00:03:49.489" style="s2">romances are so anything Arthurian</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.569" end="00:03:51.260" style="s2">that&#39;s all set in the world or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.489" end="00:03:55.069" style="s2">sometimes called the waste forest I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:56.660" style="s2">prefer the term wild wood and the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.069" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">time Chappell perilous turns up is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.660" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">one of these Grail romances and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:02.209" style="s2">it&#39;s a hero and they&#39;re all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:03.799" style="s2">stories like mirror each other so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:07.010" style="s2">many heroes really this journey has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.799" end="00:04:08.419" style="s2">taken many times but it&#39;s a hero going</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.010" end="00:04:09.769" style="s2">on his quest for the ground he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.419" end="00:04:12.379" style="s2">through the wild wood and it&#39;s dense and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.769" end="00:04:14.299" style="s2">it&#39;s scary and the thing about the wild</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.379" end="00:04:15.799" style="s2">wood is its intimidating because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.299" end="00:04:18.049" style="s2">don&#39;t know what might be behind any</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.799" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">particular treaty just imagine a super</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.049" end="00:04:22.729" style="s2">dense forest and of course because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:25.099" style="s2">one of those old stories it&#39;s a dark and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.729" end="00:04:27.979" style="s2">stormy night so he has to seek shelter</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.099" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">in this Chapel and he goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.979" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">chapel think he whew I&#39;m in the chapel</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:34.580" style="s2">now everything&#39;s fine unfortunately not</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.270" end="00:04:36.260" style="s2">so he sees in the dim light in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:38.630" style="s2">flickering candle light he sees as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.260" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">dead body later on the altar and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.630" end="00:04:42.680" style="s2">just as he starts to back away from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.310" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">body the guttering candle light is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:45.410" style="s2">extinguished by</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.340" end="00:04:46.910" style="s2">these blackened hands reaching in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.410" end="00:04:48.680" style="s2">through the windows and cutting out all</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.910" end="00:04:51.320" style="s2">the candles and suddenly he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.680" end="00:04:52.940" style="s2">dark and the sound just this moaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.320" end="00:04:54.980" style="s2">intense sound and they&#39;re shifting</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.940" end="00:04:58.430" style="s2">around on the dead body on the altar and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.980" end="00:05:00.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just terrifying thankfully that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.430" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">not our chapel paradise but do you think</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.890" end="00:05:05.150" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that this turns up in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:07.310" style="s2">Grail quests because real quests I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.150" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">malaises all sorts of things we often</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.310" end="00:05:11.510" style="s2">think if it is linked to you know Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:13.100" style="s2">and stuff but actually there are stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.510" end="00:05:15.560" style="s2">where it&#39;s not anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.100" end="00:05:18.470" style="s2">religion but I do think it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.560" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">represents the old certainties like</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.470" end="00:05:22.340" style="s2">religion like the idea of a natural</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:23.810" style="s2">order like the idea that there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.340" end="00:05:25.550" style="s2">true king who&#39;ll come back and make</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.810" end="00:05:27.890" style="s2">everything right again it represents</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.550" end="00:05:30.200" style="s2">certainty and that&#39;s often what</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.890" end="00:05:32.030" style="s2">religions promised to give us nothing I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.200" end="00:05:33.590" style="s2">mean Scientology is actually called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.030" end="00:05:35.150" style="s2">religion of certainty or the science of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.590" end="00:05:36.680" style="s2">certainty I think they call it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.150" end="00:05:38.810" style="s2">what a lot of people are trying to sell</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.680" end="00:05:40.310" style="s2">to us when I start certainty maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.810" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">could think of those old certainties</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:46.670" style="s2">that become a bit destabilize now a sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:48.440" style="s2">of grail like because reason the reason</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.520" end="00:07:06.140" style="s2">go back to as a very like liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:08.690" style="s2">and this isn&#39;t our Chapel Palace either</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.140" end="00:07:11.030" style="s2">although I do like the hymns and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.690" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">poem ends with the Shanti Shanti Shanti</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.030" end="00:07:16.700" style="s2">which is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:19.100" style="s2">so that bought me thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.700" end="00:07:21.050" style="s2">word liminal I&#39;ve always been obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.100" end="00:07:22.760" style="s2">by this word I probably overuse it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.050" end="00:07:24.440" style="s2">the reason I hope you use it so I learnt</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.760" end="00:07:25.940" style="s2">it in University where I studied English</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.440" end="00:07:30.170" style="s2">literature it might not surprise you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.940" end="00:07:32.750" style="s2">hear and I remember being familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.170" end="00:07:34.820" style="s2">the concept and I sort of had an actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.750" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">location for the word liminal that made</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.820" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">sense to me and it was here the wood</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:41.450" style="s2">between the worlds this is from The</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:51.470" style="s2">really beautiful wood it&#39;s really dense</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.600" end="00:07:53.450" style="s2">like the wild wood and it&#39;s described as</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.470" end="00:07:55.850" style="s2">the quietest wood you can imagine you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.450" end="00:07:57.350" style="s2">can hear the great trees growing and the</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.669" end="00:08:05.180" style="s2">quickly forget where they came from and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.620" end="00:08:07.550" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really apropos that a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.180" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">vision of a perilous being in a wood</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.550" end="00:08:14.180" style="s2">like this it is for me it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:16.370" style="s2">archetypal liminal space and when we in</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.180" end="00:08:18.590" style="s2">TS Eliot when he&#39;s writing about</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.950" end="00:08:34.909" style="s2">kind of hoping to find it or looking for</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.909" end="00:08:38.360" style="s2">just carry on with me on this journey</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:40.010" style="s2">and I know it&#39;s a little bit a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:40.280" style="s2">bit strange but we&#39;ll get there in the</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.280" end="00:08:45.530" style="s2">so the pools remind me of Robert Anton</p>

<p begin="00:08:45.530" end="00:08:49.910" style="s2">book where I first came across the term</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.910" end="00:08:56.060" style="s2">ago and so far since then Robert Anton</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.770" end="00:09:04.940" style="s2">came out in 1977 are these a perfect I</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:09.290" style="s2">liked it when people bring reading</p>

<p begin="00:09:09.290" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">tunnels are kind of like these</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.370" end="00:09:14.150" style="s2">through which you see the world but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:16.190" style="s2">also shape your perception they tempt</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.150" end="00:09:18.140" style="s2">you with a promise of certainty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:20.510" style="s2">kind of the siren singing at the end of</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.510" end="00:09:24.710" style="s2">um analogous to what Peter talks about</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.850" end="00:09:26.570" style="s2">when he talks about mimetic tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.710" end="00:09:28.070" style="s2">interestingly as you&#39;ll know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.570" end="00:09:30.200" style="s2">read the book Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.070" end="00:09:31.339" style="s2">describes almost going insane from</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.790" end="00:09:42.380" style="s2">little bit after immersing himself in</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.930" end="00:09:49.400" style="s2">a skeptic where I get really into all</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:51.910" style="s2">different New Age subcultures I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.400" end="00:09:55.700" style="s2">like I&#39;ve been on the brink for a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:09:57.980" style="s2">so well Max and Wilson describes Chapel</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.700" end="00:09:59.270" style="s2">perilous at that time when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.980" end="00:10:01.070" style="s2">wondering whether what you&#39;re perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.270" end="00:10:03.170" style="s2">is real or if it&#39;s just in your head</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.070" end="00:10:05.390" style="s2">when the map is inadequate for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.170" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">territory and this isn&#39;t quite our</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.390" end="00:10:11.240" style="s2">Chapel perilous either but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">close so I think our Chapel perilous</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.240" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist yet I think this is us</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:16.670" style="s2">building it right now and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:19.130" style="s2">going to incorporate some of the themes</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.670" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">of the previous chapel palaces that do</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.130" end="00:10:25.010" style="s2">exist or have existed in literature so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:26.420" style="s2">think there&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:27.890" style="s2">challenging and we&#39;re gonna need to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.420" end="00:10:29.209" style="s2">brave and I know that sounds silly</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.890" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">because this is just talking on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.209" end="00:10:33.380" style="s2">internet but I think we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:37.400" style="s2">something of that kind of questing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.380" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">spirit to it I think that as in Alex</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.400" end="00:10:40.339" style="s2">Chapel perilous there&#39;s gonna be a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:42.380" style="s2">of disillusionment and perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.339" end="00:10:45.500" style="s2">morning as we have to let go some things</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.380" end="00:10:47.450" style="s2">that seemed like seemed important to us</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.500" end="00:10:49.520" style="s2">or seemed like the way things were</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.450" end="00:10:51.320" style="s2">perhaps and I hope that there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.520" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">a sense of sort of play and liberation</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.320" end="00:10:57.140" style="s2">as in Robert Anton Wilson Chapel</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">perilous he said Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.140" end="00:11:02.600" style="s2">that is that when you go through trouble</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">parish you either come out insane or</p>
