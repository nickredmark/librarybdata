<p begin="00:00:50.239" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">into discourse with some of these</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">to the meaning crisis I put a diagram on</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.039" end="00:01:27.329" style="s2">played a central role</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.069" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">dysgraphia and I didn&#39;t realize it there</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.319" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">was something bothering me the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:50.279" style="s2">time about the diagram I misspelled</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:53.999" style="s2">Heidegger I won&#39;t make that mistake</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.279" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">again I mentioned the work of Nishida in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.999" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">the shot initially in the Kyoto school I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">will talk briefly about nishitani here</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">but I won&#39;t be able to go into that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:05.639" style="s2">depth I do intend to pursue this later</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:07.349" style="s2">in another series I am putting together</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.639" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2">I&#39;m putting together a couple of series</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.349" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">to follow this one and I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:16.140" style="s2">do a series that will include work on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:18.630" style="s2">the kyoto school series that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.140" end="00:02:20.220" style="s2">entitled the god beyond God in which we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.630" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.220" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">all of these great non-theistic thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:26.850" style="s2">within both eastern and western</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.990" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">traditions and things like be killed a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.850" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">school that tried to bridge between them</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">so I will have to neglect to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:38.190" style="s2">the curative school in this series but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:41.100" style="s2">promise to follow it up more deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:45.600" style="s2">another series I also mentioned Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.100" end="00:02:47.610" style="s2">and I will not be able to talk very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">a problem maybe not even on all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">Derrida and deconstructionism I will</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">also address this again when I return in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">the other series to God beyond God</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">especially when I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:02.490" style="s2">the relationship between Derrida and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:04.470" style="s2">what&#39;s called negative theology so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.490" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">of you will be perhaps disappointed that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t talk too much about Derrida or</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">the ACOTA school I do promise to return</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">to that in another series that I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.740" style="s2">currently working on so what I did I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">I sort of tried to give a quick</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.740" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">background did Heidegger I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">the importance of literal and-and-and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">phenomenology and I pointed you to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">work of Sokolowski as a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:34.710" style="s2">introduction and there&#39;s slow gonna back</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">to the things whose role and he does</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.710" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">write a book with the word crisis in its</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">title the crisis I think in what is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:43.770" style="s2">in European science we talks and this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">basically he is pointing to the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.770" end="00:03:50.310" style="s2">contact epistemology and he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:52.700" style="s2">get that contact back and this is done</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.310" end="00:03:54.810" style="s2">through a reflective experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:03:58.740" style="s2">introspection but through a reflective</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.810" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">experiential attention paid to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.740" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">structures and processes within our</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">experience and I pointed out how there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:09.420" style="s2">two components in this there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:11.250" style="s2">intentional mental directedness noesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.420" end="00:04:13.050" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the world disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.250" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep correlation between them</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.050" end="00:04:18.600" style="s2">this is the note and this is the new</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">EEMA the new esis and notice that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.600" end="00:04:24.660" style="s2">a term I&#39;ve used also to describe</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">perspectival knowing right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:32.760" style="s2">and the correlation between the noesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:35.760" style="s2">and the no EEMA is very much right like</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.760" end="00:04:37.740" style="s2">the agent arena relationship now we took</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.760" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">a look at heidegger&#39;s main criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.740" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">hospitals work had and heidegger&#39;s main</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">criticism is that hustlers work had not</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:53.880" style="s2">really given given us back the missing</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:56.450" style="s2">contact I would say that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.880" end="00:05:00.380" style="s2">agreement with this I think Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.450" end="00:05:02.700" style="s2">pointing to something very important in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.380" end="00:05:05.070" style="s2">the critique of phenomenology that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.700" end="00:05:09.350" style="s2">espero has picked up in his wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.070" end="00:05:11.430" style="s2">book the end of phenomenology anyways</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.350" end="00:05:13.560" style="s2">well suppose work had not given us a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.430" end="00:05:16.350" style="s2">contact but it has not really developed</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.560" end="00:05:19.350" style="s2">adequately participatory knowing now I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.350" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">do think that Marlow Ponte went a long</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.350" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">way towards addressing this he&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:28.260" style="s2">Heidegger with his notion of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">and I think I tried to explain how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.260" end="00:05:32.100" style="s2">this notion of embodiment has been taken</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">up into cognitive science and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.100" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">intimately it is connected with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:40.410" style="s2">return to contact epistemology in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:42.750" style="s2">would argue that there is no return to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.410" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">contact epistemology without a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.750" end="00:05:53.580" style="s2">existential and theoretical recognition</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:56.100" style="s2">of embodiment so Heidegger is critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.580" end="00:05:58.140" style="s2">both the being active the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.100" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">participatory knowing and perhaps that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.140" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">addressed by merleau-ponty but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:05.190" style="s2">further thing that I think Marlow Ponte</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:08.190" style="s2">does not address that is also lacking</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.190" end="00:06:10.410" style="s2">for Heidegger right is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.190" end="00:06:13.230" style="s2">participatory knowing is not set with an</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.410" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">ontology it&#39;s not set within a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.230" end="00:06:18.330" style="s2">understanding of being and how we come</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:22.500" style="s2">into contact with being being as</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.330" end="00:06:25.760" style="s2">realness is in in the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.500" end="00:06:28.260" style="s2">ground Ignis without which grounds truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.760" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">seems to be something that Hydra feels</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.260" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">that was lacking in Husserl&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.110" end="00:06:34.470" style="s2">another way of putting it is that how do</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:36.780" style="s2">they thought that HUS row was still</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.470" end="00:06:39.030" style="s2">trapped within the Cartesian cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.780" end="00:06:43.289" style="s2">cognitive grammar was still trapped</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.030" end="00:06:46.740" style="s2">within subjectivity and this is the main</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.289" end="00:06:49.169" style="s2">thing that Sparrow criticizes throughout</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.740" end="00:06:51.900" style="s2">his entire book there&#39;s also a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.169" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">video by him that you can watch on his</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.900" end="00:06:56.370" style="s2">critique of phenomenology that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:59.729" style="s2">phenomenology is driven by the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.370" end="00:07:03.930" style="s2">returning to the things but because of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.729" end="00:07:05.879" style="s2">its approach it actually can never</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.930" end="00:07:09.150" style="s2">return to the things it is still locked</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.879" end="00:07:12.539" style="s2">into a kind of subjectivity or a hidden</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.150" end="00:07:17.819" style="s2">kind of idealism that what is really</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.539" end="00:07:19.229" style="s2">needed right to get to being is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.819" end="00:07:21.090" style="s2">aspect of how to gear that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.229" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">talk about shortly which is to pay</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.090" end="00:07:26.460" style="s2">attention to the independence of being</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">from our experience of it which is</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:32.250" style="s2">tend to emphasize and Heidegger that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.810" style="s2">largely because I think while it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.370" end="00:07:54.840" style="s2">to Heidegger how do we get to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.630" end="00:07:57.509" style="s2">deeper contact well it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.840" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">interesting that he tries to do he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.479" end="00:08:13.770" style="s2">this through a specific kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.250" end="00:08:15.060" style="s2">questioning now this questioning you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.770" end="00:08:16.500" style="s2">have to think of this questioning as</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.819" end="00:08:24.360" style="s2">to think of it much more as within the</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.300" end="00:08:43.719" style="s2">transformation now this brings us to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.390" end="00:08:46.779" style="s2">central thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.719" end="00:08:49.300" style="s2">for Heidegger in some ways and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.779" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s notion of design being there</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.300" end="00:08:55.930" style="s2">this is our being and notice notice how</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.310" style="s2">this is an inheritance from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.930" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">Christian tradition that we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.310" end="00:09:02.410" style="s2">image of God somehow by Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:05.620" style="s2">taking this up as somehow by paying</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.410" end="00:09:08.319" style="s2">attention by wandering into questing</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.620" end="00:09:10.990" style="s2">into our being we will get a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.319" end="00:09:13.990" style="s2">understanding of being itself why is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.990" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">that because for Heidegger our being is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.990" end="00:09:18.209" style="s2">the being right whose being is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:22.149" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.209" end="00:09:25.060" style="s2">we are the type of being who actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.149" end="00:09:26.470" style="s2">question who and what we are in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.060" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">that makes a difference</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.470" end="00:09:32.110" style="s2">to who and what we are this is the core</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:34.509" style="s2">idea of existentialism existentialism is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.110" end="00:09:37.870" style="s2">that we are fundamentally right without</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.509" end="00:09:39.610" style="s2">an essence and that we are right our</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.870" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">essence if you want to put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.610" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">is to have no essence and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:47.709" style="s2">are continually defining ourselves by</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:50.199" style="s2">how we question and right and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.709" end="00:09:53.819" style="s2">question our being and respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.199" end="00:09:57.310" style="s2">questioning question so the idea by</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.819" end="00:10:00.250" style="s2">phenomenologically exploring that being</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.310" end="00:10:01.630" style="s2">our design the way we are the being</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.250" end="00:10:03.370" style="s2">whose being is in question we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.630" end="00:10:06.040" style="s2">simultaneously come into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.370" end="00:10:12.610" style="s2">our modal existence come into the being</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.040" end="00:10:18.459" style="s2">mode and come into contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.610" end="00:10:22.290" style="s2">mystery of beer now coming into contact</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.459" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">with this is central to Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.290" end="00:10:28.089" style="s2">Heidegger is deeply responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:29.709" style="s2">meaning crisis one of Heidegger is most</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.089" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">famous or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.709" end="00:10:35.709" style="s2">infamous theses the one that runs is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:39.430" style="s2">constant thread throughout his work is</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.709" end="00:10:41.980" style="s2">the this idea that the history of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.430" end="00:10:45.209" style="s2">metaphysics which Heidegger tends to use</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.980" end="00:10:49.300" style="s2">in a pejorative term the history of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.209" end="00:10:52.120" style="s2">philosophical existential and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.300" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">also religious responses</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.120" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">to design to the kind of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:07.749" style="s2">being we have the history of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.550" end="00:11:11.050" style="s2">response is metaphysics and for</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.749" end="00:11:14.139" style="s2">Heidegger the hit that history is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.050" end="00:11:16.829" style="s2">history of nihilism Heidegger sees that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.139" end="00:11:19.509" style="s2">whole project has fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.829" end="00:11:22.120" style="s2">misconstrued to use our language the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.509" end="00:11:26.879" style="s2">whole project is a fundamental Mis</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.120" end="00:11:30.249" style="s2">framing of our relationship to being and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.879" end="00:11:33.670" style="s2">because of that that has produced this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.249" end="00:11:36.459" style="s2">deep loss of contact with our being and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.670" end="00:11:39.550" style="s2">therefore simultaneously with being</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.459" end="00:11:41.769" style="s2">itself and that for Heidegger is the</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.769" end="00:11:47.889" style="s2">that we saw for example in the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.559" end="00:11:51.430" style="s2">half of this series is the history of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.889" end="00:11:53.170" style="s2">nihilism and you can see I hope if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.430" end="00:11:55.180" style="s2">remember that argument that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.170" end="00:11:57.699" style="s2">lot of great truth in what Heidegger has</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.180" end="00:12:00.129" style="s2">to say about how the unfolding of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.699" end="00:12:06.749" style="s2">history of that metaphysical project has</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.129" end="00:12:09.550" style="s2">led us into the meaning crisis now</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.749" end="00:12:12.249" style="s2">Heidegger does not use the word ontology</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.550" end="00:12:14.769" style="s2">in a pejorative way the way he uses the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.249" end="00:12:17.800" style="s2">word metaphysics most people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.769" end="00:12:21.309" style="s2">this distinction as as clearly as</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.800" end="00:12:22.120" style="s2">Heidegger stipulates it to be so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.309" end="00:12:24.069" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about how do their</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.120" end="00:12:26.709" style="s2">metaphysics is a pejorative term it is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.069" end="00:12:28.600" style="s2">Mis framing of the ontological project</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.709" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">the ontological project is the project</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.600" end="00:12:33.850" style="s2">of understanding our being and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:38.490" style="s2">understanding our relation to being and</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.730" end="00:12:46.509" style="s2">I mean editors volumous who&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.970" end="00:12:48.970" style="s2">prolific he&#39;s also famously difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.509" end="00:12:51.069" style="s2">read his wheats his works have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.970" end="00:12:54.459" style="s2">operatic structure to them they often</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.069" end="00:12:57.100" style="s2">fail to come to any clear conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.459" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">part of that I think is legitimate part</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.100" end="00:13:02.799" style="s2">of that it right is him wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">trying to break out of the cultural</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:08.060" style="s2">so think and this is part of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.030" end="00:13:11.460" style="s2">criticism of Heidegger part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.060" end="00:13:15.540" style="s2">self-promotional by constantly being the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.460" end="00:13:18.060" style="s2">person for you know I&#39;m now seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.540" end="00:13:19.980" style="s2">these deep mysteries he also and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.060" end="00:13:21.900" style="s2">difficult it is to think about them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.980" end="00:13:24.420" style="s2">how he&#39;s exemplifying that difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.900" end="00:13:25.830" style="s2">he&#39;s all he was also and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.420" end="00:13:27.840" style="s2">pretty clear this is part of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.830" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">doing he was also from those you can see</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.840" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">this from some of those who knew him</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:31.980" style="s2">more intimately</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:34.770" style="s2">he was also building a mystique around</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.980" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">himself so you have to take that into</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.770" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">account so all of that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:41.310" style="s2">difficult to sort of point to here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:45.690" style="s2">where I&#39;m going to point to the core of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.310" end="00:13:48.780" style="s2">Heidegger right but I do think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.690" end="00:13:50.730" style="s2">something for me and for many other</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.780" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">people and I hope for you there there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.730" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">a particular place where I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:59.880" style="s2">zero in on what Heidegger is doing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:14:02.430" style="s2">this is his his his important essay on</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.430" end="00:14:07.080" style="s2">on the essence of truth and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:08.520" style="s2">is important because it will tie into</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.520" end="00:14:16.590" style="s2">want to read an extended quote from this</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:28.680" style="s2">have to read a lot of Heidegger before</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.660" end="00:15:05.790" style="s2">all of this for you the openness of</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.790" end="00:15:10.860" style="s2">you work imported towards things right</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.740" end="00:15:12.570" style="s2">for only through the latter the openness</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.860" end="00:15:15.000" style="s2">of compartment and I&#39;ll try to explain</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.570" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">to you what that means can what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.000" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">opened up be</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:22.369" style="s2">what can what has opened up really</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:24.350" style="s2">become the standard for the present ativ</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.369" end="00:15:26.209" style="s2">correspondence okay so let&#39;s stop here</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.350" end="00:15:28.339" style="s2">so here&#39;s the idea of truth as</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.209" end="00:15:34.309" style="s2">correspondents a standard notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.339" end="00:15:38.179" style="s2">truth so the idea here is this is how</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.309" end="00:15:40.910" style="s2">truth works here&#39;s a statement and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.179" end="00:15:44.119" style="s2">makes it correct is that it corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.910" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">in some important way to reality what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.119" end="00:15:48.829" style="s2">in the statement and what&#39;s in reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:50.899" style="s2">right correspond that&#39;s what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.829" end="00:15:52.999" style="s2">correct that&#39;s what it is to be true now</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.899" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">of course famously philosophers have</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.999" end="00:15:56.269" style="s2">argued for a long time and many</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:58.129" style="s2">different ways about with this</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.269" end="00:16:01.549" style="s2">correspondences but what Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.129" end="00:16:03.259" style="s2">trying to say is right that that debate</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.549" end="00:16:04.819" style="s2">about the correspondence has missed</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.259" end="00:16:07.119" style="s2">something and here&#39;s part of the MIS</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.819" end="00:16:10.129" style="s2">framing it&#39;s missed that this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.119" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">corresponding relationship is grounded</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.129" end="00:16:21.259" style="s2">is depended on right and it&#39;s sustained</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:23.359" style="s2">by a deeper relationship all right open</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.359" end="00:16:30.439" style="s2">assigned the standard so this lower</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.459" end="00:16:33.730" style="s2">relationship this open compartment is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.439" end="00:16:36.379" style="s2">affordance of an ability to set up</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.379" end="00:16:41.569" style="s2">reality such that we find them true now</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.309" end="00:16:43.609" style="s2">it&#39;s not to think about what this means</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.569" end="00:16:45.289" style="s2">there must mean that in making the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.609" end="00:16:48.139" style="s2">statement the person is directed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.289" end="00:16:50.869" style="s2">connected it also means that right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.139" end="00:16:54.439" style="s2">statement is picking up on some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.869" end="00:16:57.079" style="s2">of reality that it&#39;s disclosed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.439" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of connection there so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.079" end="00:17:02.389" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to point towards thus this</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:04.370" style="s2">means that it must take over a pre given</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.389" end="00:17:06.649" style="s2">standard for all presentation this</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.370" end="00:17:09.470" style="s2">belongs to the openness of comportment</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.649" end="00:17:11.929" style="s2">so the normative standard what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.470" end="00:17:14.419" style="s2">normally call truth truth as correctness</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.929" end="00:17:17.209" style="s2">as correspondence between statement and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.419" end="00:17:19.870" style="s2">reality right is ultimately grounded</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:31.430" style="s2">here to use some of our language you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.049" end="00:17:36.200" style="s2">see how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.430" end="00:17:39.740" style="s2">agent and the arena have to be shaped to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.200" end="00:17:43.040" style="s2">each other such that what the agent does</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.740" end="00:17:45.470" style="s2">or says is meaningful in that arena so</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.040" end="00:17:50.620" style="s2">the agent arena relationship makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.470" end="00:17:53.450" style="s2">possible and affords right this right</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.620" end="00:17:56.420" style="s2">correctness but of course what hydrators</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.450" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">pointing to is yes but what grounds this</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.420" end="00:18:01.220" style="s2">agent arena relationship now I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:04.220" style="s2">to argue that it&#39;s ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.220" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">process of relevance realization we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.220" end="00:18:08.420" style="s2">going to come back to that Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.280" style="s2">gonna I&#39;m gonna argue that this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.420" end="00:18:12.890" style="s2">relevance I&#39;ve argued this is relevance</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.280" end="00:18:16.580" style="s2">realization Heydrich talks about this in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.890" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">terms of attunement he uses a tune mint</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.580" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">which is very nice because it picks up</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">on musicality so here&#39;s another quote by</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">Heidegger specifically mention this</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:33.050" style="s2">however being attuned attunement can</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:43.780" style="s2">be understood as experience and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:47.470" style="s2">he is rejecting any subjective</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.780" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">interpretation of entombment why because</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.470" end="00:18:53.050" style="s2">to continue it is there by simply</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.150" end="00:19:10.130" style="s2">possible and I argue that that of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.370" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">was the case right for relevance</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:29.700" style="s2">right and what Heidegger says is right</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.720" end="00:25:50.130" style="s2">I&#39;m going to show you is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.800" end="00:25:55.040" style="s2">appropriate to Heidegger in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.130" end="00:26:00.179" style="s2">this idea of sacredness as a as an acted</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.040" end="00:26:02.840" style="s2">enacted participatory right resonance to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.179" end="00:26:07.950" style="s2">the mourners the inexhaustible Ness of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.840" end="00:26:10.679" style="s2">reality in order to pick this up I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.950" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">to briefly because as I said I can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.679" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">into this a great deal I hope to go into</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">this again later and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:25.260" style="s2">in another series but I want to briefly</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">talk about the work of Hartmann and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.260" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">what&#39;s called object-oriented ontology</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:35.100" style="s2">or what&#39;s also known as speculative</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:36.690" style="s2">realism and this is the position from</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.100" end="00:26:39.030" style="s2">which Sparrow and Harmon and others have</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.690" end="00:26:43.890" style="s2">critique phenomenology as being</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.030" end="00:26:46.020" style="s2">inadequate so what&#39;s again trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.890" end="00:26:47.480" style="s2">summarize all of this which is like some</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.020" end="00:26:50.580" style="s2">of the most exciting work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.480" end="00:26:53.130" style="s2">recently being done in ontology you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.580" end="00:26:54.660" style="s2">and I and I respect people who say we</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.130" end="00:26:55.950" style="s2">need to talk about ontology more but if</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.660" end="00:26:58.200" style="s2">you want to talk about ontology just</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.950" end="00:27:01.320" style="s2">don&#39;t do old talk about ontology pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.200" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">attention to the insightful inventive</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.320" end="00:27:08.820" style="s2">new work being done on ontology within</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:10.830" style="s2">speculative realism so again I I</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.820" end="00:27:12.600" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even claim this as a summary</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.830" end="00:27:14.610" style="s2">I&#39;m just picking up one important thread</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.600" end="00:27:16.380" style="s2">of the speculative realism as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.610" end="00:27:17.820" style="s2">trying to develop this important idea of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.380" end="00:27:19.290" style="s2">Heidegger and because we&#39;re gonna need</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.820" end="00:27:22.190" style="s2">it when we talk about other people like</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.290" end="00:27:26.520" style="s2">you know Tillich and young and Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.190" end="00:27:29.010" style="s2">so the core of this is not the contine</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.520" end="00:27:31.020" style="s2">picture of the thing in itself veiled by</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.010" end="00:27:33.510" style="s2">subjectivity right so remember that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.020" end="00:27:35.610" style="s2">content picture right right our</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.510" end="00:27:36.990" style="s2">subjectivity completely veils the thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.610" end="00:27:41.060" style="s2">in itself and makes it ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.990" end="00:27:41.060" style="s2">inaccessible to us</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.240" end="00:27:52.530" style="s2">so what Hartmann and speaking up on is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.250" end="00:27:54.120" style="s2">that this transient and we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.530" end="00:27:57.020" style="s2">to see that there&#39;s a difficulty there</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.120" end="00:27:59.850" style="s2">they have a difficulty with limiting</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.020" end="00:28:02.370" style="s2">ontology to what they call correlation</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.850" end="00:28:04.500" style="s2">just our experience of ontology but</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.370" end="00:28:07.410" style="s2">nevertheless let&#39;s start here this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.500" end="00:28:10.680" style="s2">transient makes both the subject and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.410" end="00:28:14.030" style="s2">object possible in experience right in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.680" end="00:28:14.030" style="s2">phenomenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.620" end="00:28:19.670" style="s2">so what does that mean well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.350" end="00:28:24.860" style="s2">different way about thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.670" end="00:28:27.650" style="s2">you encounter objects right instead of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.860" end="00:28:30.130" style="s2">the Contin thing in itself that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.650" end="00:28:33.110" style="s2">veiled from us by our subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.130" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">instead think about two things happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.110" end="00:28:35.990" style="s2">simultaneously this is picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:38.150" style="s2">what Heidegger is talking about think</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.990" end="00:28:39.640" style="s2">about the thing shining into</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.150" end="00:28:41.810" style="s2">subjectivity and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.640" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">phenomenology originally means how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.810" end="00:28:46.280" style="s2">their picks up on that the Greek term</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:49.970" style="s2">phenomenon actually means to shine forth</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.280" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">so simultaneously the thing is shining</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.970" end="00:28:57.260" style="s2">into my subjectivity but that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:29:00.440" style="s2">interpenetrated inter afforded with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.260" end="00:29:04.310" style="s2">is simultaneously withdrawing from my</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.440" end="00:29:09.320" style="s2">framing it is always beyond my framing</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.310" end="00:29:11.930" style="s2">as well and that that beyond this is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.320" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">something in my phenomenology but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.930" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">contributes to the sense of the realness</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:21.500" style="s2">of my phenomenological experience right</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:23.750" style="s2">think about how in virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.500" end="00:29:26.150" style="s2">when there if the world if you get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.750" end="00:29:30.110" style="s2">sense that the world is closed if that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.150" end="00:29:33.350" style="s2">you can drain it dry with your activity</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.110" end="00:29:35.900" style="s2">it loses its realness but only and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.350" end="00:29:37.550" style="s2">here&#39;s now the openness that kiters</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.900" end="00:29:39.560" style="s2">talking about the compartment but only</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.550" end="00:29:42.200" style="s2">if there&#39;s a realness a way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.560" end="00:29:45.140" style="s2">world withdraws beyond you continually</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.200" end="00:29:46.760" style="s2">right so things there&#39;s always a horizon</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.140" end="00:29:48.140" style="s2">of your experience a horizon is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.760" end="00:29:51.230" style="s2">something you always move towards but</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.140" end="00:29:53.990" style="s2">you can never reach right so as long as</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.230" end="00:29:56.840" style="s2">that world constantly withdraws as it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.990" end="00:29:59.780" style="s2">also shines into your experience then it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.840" end="00:30:02.060" style="s2">is real to you now the morning is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.780" end="00:30:04.400" style="s2">something in your experience it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.060" end="00:30:06.610" style="s2">object of your experience but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.400" end="00:30:09.350" style="s2">feature that withdrawal is as much a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.610" end="00:30:12.580" style="s2">contributor to the realness of things as</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.350" end="00:30:16.040" style="s2">they&#39;re shining into your subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.580" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">this is I think a profound way in which</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.270" end="00:35:00.829" style="s2">articulated and exemplified to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.290" end="00:35:09.660" style="s2">Dreyfus is an important interpreter of</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.390" end="00:35:18.810" style="s2">cognitive science in fact Dreyfus tried</p>

<p begin="00:35:39.869" end="00:35:45.630" style="s2">wrote on heidegger&#39;s most central work</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:50.040" style="s2">being in time and a dreyfuses book is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.630" end="00:35:52.980" style="s2">called being in the world and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.040" end="00:35:55.670" style="s2">read you a quote for that and the quote</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.980" end="00:35:58.290" style="s2">is exemplary it&#39;s not a unique isolated</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.670" end="00:36:01.230" style="s2">moment in Dreyfuss work it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.290" end="00:36:03.420" style="s2">that is exemplary of a theme running</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.230" end="00:36:09.109" style="s2">throughout Dreyfuss here&#39;s the quote</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.420" end="00:36:12.329" style="s2">from that book on Heidegger okay quote</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.109" end="00:36:15.150" style="s2">facts and rules are by themselves</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.230" end="00:36:45.150" style="s2">right are just more meaningless facts</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.080" end="00:43:40.500" style="s2">things are not right irrelevant they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.070" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">deeply relevant to each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.500" end="00:43:49.210" style="s2">you&#39;ve got Dreyfus over here and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.490" style="s2">whole aspect of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.210" end="00:43:57.040" style="s2">and Dreyfus is clearly pointing out that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.490" end="00:44:00.340" style="s2">this is no on Proposition all coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:02.170" style="s2">from Heidegger non-computational in the</p>

<p begin="00:44:12.760" end="00:44:23.080" style="s2">then over here you have Corbin and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.710" end="00:44:25.570" style="s2">calling all of this gnosis this</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.150" end="00:44:39.490" style="s2">isn&#39;t apparent in Dreyfus is that he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.490" end="00:44:44.230" style="s2">it saves us right remember the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.130" end="00:44:47.320" style="s2">are trying to free us to liberate us</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.230" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">from existential entrapment so Corbin is</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.320" end="00:44:52.390" style="s2">pointing out that how this Corbett is</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:55.089" style="s2">making explicit that this machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.390" end="00:44:58.180" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.089" end="00:45:01.390" style="s2">responding to the modal confusion it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.180" end="00:45:04.780" style="s2">a way of responding to the forgetfulness</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.390" end="00:45:09.160" style="s2">of being it is a way of awakening from</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.780" end="00:45:12.660" style="s2">the meaning crisis so let&#39;s try and do</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.160" end="00:45:12.660" style="s2">this again a little bit more carefully</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.740" end="00:45:26.490" style="s2">so I do this a little bit more carefully</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.940" end="00:45:29.670" style="s2">what is this forgetfulness this modal</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.490" end="00:45:32.970" style="s2">confusion okay so on one hand we have</p>

<p begin="00:46:31.330" end="00:46:42.119" style="s2">there&#39;s the attunement right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.600" end="00:46:42.119" style="s2">also the independence of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.950" end="00:46:58.230" style="s2">right I think the attunement clearly</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.410" end="00:47:00.819" style="s2">points to relevance</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.230" end="00:47:01.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve already argued that repeatedly I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.819" end="00:47:05.619" style="s2">hope I don&#39;t have to argue it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.990" end="00:47:07.750" style="s2">but this independence of being this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.619" end="00:47:11.190" style="s2">independent right of the correlation</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.750" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">between us and being that being always</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.190" end="00:47:16.450" style="s2">transcends how it is being known and</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">being experienced by us this is the more</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.450" end="00:47:21.700" style="s2">nests that withdrawal that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.260" style="s2">simultaneously present and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.700" end="00:47:25.740" style="s2">what I almost made a mistake sorry about</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.260" end="00:47:28.450" style="s2">that right the more nests is</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.740" end="00:47:38.349" style="s2">simultaneously with the presence of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.450" end="00:47:41.799" style="s2">shining right this I think is what</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.349" end="00:47:48.280" style="s2">Harmon and others would argue ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.799" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">gives things what I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.280" end="00:47:53.170" style="s2">all of their realness but an important</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:48:03.490" style="s2">pole of their realness that we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.170" end="00:48:05.980" style="s2">neglected so you can see what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.490" end="00:48:08.980" style="s2">to point there&#39;s I mean the word I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.980" end="00:48:11.020" style="s2">you know it might even seem natural to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.980" end="00:48:13.390" style="s2">put here right of the independence of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.020" end="00:48:16.049" style="s2">being its truth but that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.390" end="00:48:18.670" style="s2">right right because we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.049" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">truth belongs up here in the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.670" end="00:48:23.349" style="s2">of Alafaya or even higher up in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:28.770" style="s2">correctness of our propositions based on</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.349" end="00:48:31.210" style="s2">Alafaya right so this is relevance and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.770" end="00:48:33.369" style="s2">what am i stopping here because remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.210" end="00:48:35.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to confuse relevance and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.369" end="00:48:38.799" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to disconnect relevance</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.980" end="00:48:40.510" style="s2">from truth or realness right and I want</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.799" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">to put to something deeper here that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.510" end="00:48:46.329" style="s2">relevance must always be right open to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:48.220" style="s2">and not remember not just as an</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.329" end="00:48:51.069" style="s2">acknowledgement as a limit it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.220" end="00:48:54.220" style="s2">an ongoing constraint the relevance has</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.069" end="00:48:56.770" style="s2">to have an ongoing constraint right in</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.220" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">its connectedness to a sense of the more</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.270" end="00:49:18.619" style="s2">so what would be going on over here in</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.490" end="00:49:24.920" style="s2">the having mode and where we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.619" end="00:49:27.410" style="s2">the modal confusion so now we think of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.920" end="00:49:31.670" style="s2">an object we think of its being in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.410" end="00:49:33.619" style="s2">of how it can be manipulated by us not</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.670" end="00:49:35.900" style="s2">just physically conceptually remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.619" end="00:49:38.270" style="s2">this is the the quintessential point of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.900" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">the having mode we have control we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.270" end="00:49:42.350" style="s2">we can grasp it we can manipulate it we</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:45.619" style="s2">can use it we&#39;re not confronting</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.350" end="00:49:47.810" style="s2">mysteries we&#39;re solving problems and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.619" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">what happens when we get into the having</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.810" end="00:49:52.250" style="s2">mode into conceptual manipulation and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.770" style="s2">the halving of propositions and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.250" end="00:49:57.640" style="s2">forget the being mode and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.770" end="00:50:00.350" style="s2">over here what can happen to us</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.640" end="00:50:03.770" style="s2">well and this is one of hydras main</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.350" end="00:50:07.820" style="s2">critiques we start to miss understand in</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.770" end="00:50:15.050" style="s2">a modal sense you start to misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.820" end="00:50:18.560" style="s2">being as a right particular being we</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.050" end="00:50:20.600" style="s2">misunderstand being as a being so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.560" end="00:50:23.420" style="s2">using being as a with a capital B to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.600" end="00:50:27.140" style="s2">being being where I&#39;m using a little B</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.420" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">to mean a particular being like this you</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.140" end="00:50:33.789" style="s2">know marker or this eraser or this body</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:41.660" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.789" end="00:50:44.569" style="s2">and then we misunderstand the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.660" end="00:50:47.299" style="s2">try and get back to this by positing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.569" end="00:50:49.369" style="s2">with it this is a modal confusion we try</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.299" end="00:50:51.319" style="s2">to capture which with something&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.369" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">just thinking we&#39;re not quite getting</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">being or think of being as a particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.759" end="00:50:59.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to do something more and so it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:00.410" style="s2">we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll put it to the limit</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.150" end="00:51:02.779" style="s2">I remember what Heidegger says that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.410" end="00:51:09.170" style="s2">insufficient we&#39;ll understand being</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.779" end="00:51:13.670" style="s2">right as right as the Supreme Being the</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.670" end="00:51:24.950" style="s2">perhaps the highest person the highest</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.950" end="00:51:31.130" style="s2">Heidegger this is the ultimate modal</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.069" end="00:51:34.670" style="s2">confusion for this is to try to turn</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.670" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">that can be solved by the conceptual</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.739" end="00:52:01.489" style="s2">gonna come back to that when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.299" end="00:52:03.559" style="s2">about Tillich and Barfield Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.489" end="00:52:04.999" style="s2">certainly right that there is a</p>

<p begin="00:54:50.040" end="00:54:54.090" style="s2">becomes an official member</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.450" end="00:54:55.320" style="s2">an official within the Nazi Party and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.090" end="00:54:57.030" style="s2">that is something to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.320" end="00:54:58.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s fair to bring this up because</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.030" end="00:55:00.730" style="s2">Heidegger presents his</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.360" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">entire position as an existential one</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.730" end="00:55:05.830" style="s2">not just a theoretical one and if you</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.830" end="00:55:09.670" style="s2">Nazis by just saying oh but that has</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.020" end="00:55:12.520" style="s2">nothing to do with his theory you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.670" end="00:55:14.950" style="s2">sort of fundamentally missed how he is</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.520" end="00:55:17.010" style="s2">involved with the very presentation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.950" end="00:55:19.240" style="s2">his own theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.010" end="00:55:21.370" style="s2">now Tillich is gonna take up</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.240" end="00:55:23.290" style="s2">nevertheless Heidegger&#39;s critique of</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.370" end="00:55:25.630" style="s2">Anto theology but he&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.290" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">something very interesting with it he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.630" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">going to use this as a way of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">back the very traditional religious</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:40.450" style="s2">notion of idolatry and what is wrong</p>
