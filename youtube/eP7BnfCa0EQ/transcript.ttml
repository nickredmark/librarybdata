<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:10.720" style="s2">first came out quite a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:11.920" style="s2">and i reread it for territory for this</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.720" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">episode and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.920" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">awful lot in that book we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">to cover everything from it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to cover some of it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">going to talk a fair amount about</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:22.720" style="s2">what is quantum mechanics what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">quantum computing what&#39;s the state of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.720" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">the art etc</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">so let&#39;s get started let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">some basics</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">how is the quantum world different from</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">the classical world</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">it&#39;s smaller and it&#39;s weirder</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">so the quantum mechanics describes how</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">things behave at their most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">you know the level of atoms molecules</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">elementary particles</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">and the main thing to remember about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">is that things behave differently</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">and in a weird fancy strange way</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">so sometimes you know stay it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">quantum mechanics is kind of the james</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">brown sciences</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">whatever&#39;s there it&#39;s got to be funky</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">interesting yeah one of my long-term</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">hobbies actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">is reading in the field known as quantum</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">i fell into this weird habit by reading</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">a book called quantum reality by a guy</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">named nick herbert</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">uh-huh with that book yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">yeah and ever since i&#39;ve sort of kept up</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">with the evolution of the field</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">and it is interesting to hear something</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">so fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">in our sciences and yet there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">significant number like</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">five or ten different interpretations of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">it all means and none of them are</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">inconsistent with the experimental</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">yet right including one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">you know again</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">for the shorthand of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">there&#39;s inherent randomness in you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">the positions the spins you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">various things we measure</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">and yet there&#39;s still a school it seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">like maybe it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">gaining strength at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">quantum phenomena may not actually be</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">random it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">understand the mechanisms well enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">maybe talk a little bit about quantum</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">interpretations and your views</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">on what&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">sure sure jim i thought that&#39;s a subject</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">dear to my heart because one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">the way i got into working on ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">and quantum mechanics came from doing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">master&#39;s in philosophy of science at</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">cambridge university studying</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">foundations of quantum mechanics and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">quantum interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">so i share your interest in it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">you&#39;re right there</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">are at least 10 different</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">interpretations out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">and the interesting thing about them is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">they&#39;re all consistent with experiment</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">as you say</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.760" style="s2">and all of them are each one in its own</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">way is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.760" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">unsatisfactory if any one of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">were completely satisfactory then</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">there&#39;d be only one interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">but none of them are satisfactory and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">interpret this</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">to mean that really it&#39;s hard to come up</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">with a good interpretation of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">in fact my belief is that we will never</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">have an interpretation of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">mechanics that satisfies</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">ordinary human beings or smart human</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">beings or philosophers of science</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">simply because quantum mechanics is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">strange and counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s no way to interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">strangeness and counterintuitiveness</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s certainly one of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">theories right but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">shut up and calculate basically we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">never understand it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">uh no no i&#39;m not i&#39;m not advocating that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">i think we should think about it but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">should be aware that we&#39;re not likely to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">get a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">i mean the basic problem is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">mentioned there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">tension between determinism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">uh indeterminism or chancy probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">that the schrodinger equation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">equations of motion that govern quantum</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">mechanics are themselves deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">so you set them running you say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">the situation now</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">then the equations just churn on ahead</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">and they say here&#39;s the state of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">system in the future</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">completely determined by the state in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">the past but</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">when you actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">predictions for the results of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">and you look at what you observe then</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">you find that those predictions</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">are probabilistic and not determined so</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">how do you reconcile those two features</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">the fact that the underlying theory is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">in some sense deterministic and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">probabilistic predictions for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">going to happen that&#39;s pretty tough</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">now do you have a view do you have a an</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">intuition shall we say on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">randomness versus determinism question</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">or is it just so damn hazy</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not worth speculating in your view</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">oh no i do i actually i have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">view which i find reasonably satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">i say no no views are satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">are you know perfectly satisfying but as</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">you know well from</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">reading about this that the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">original interpretation that people came</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">up with came</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">largely from neil&#39;s wars called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">copenhagen interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">and bohr said okay the underlying laws</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">are deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">um but these just describe kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">microscopic phenomenon when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">macroscopic things</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">like measurement devices that are making</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">measurements then</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">these are you know kind of categorically</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">different than the microscopic devices</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">so their behaviors can be different</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s pretty annoying because like</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">well you know the devices are made up</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">you know our measurement apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">is made up of of atoms and molecules and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">things behaving</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">according to laws of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">why shouldn&#39;t they also obey the laws of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s one interpretation and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">very commonly used interpretation which</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">is pretty wacky but is</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">is adopted by many people is called the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">many worlds interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">which says yeah the underlying laws are</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">and so you set this up and the universe</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">evolves in a deterministic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">but every time you make a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">or look at something happening that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">appears to be probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">the universe splits into two pieces uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">and you only get one of them and which</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:57.759" style="s2">one you get is determined by the laws of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">chance so it&#39;s probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.759" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s made okay that explains</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on as you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">it fits what the what we see</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">experimentally but then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">every time you make a measurement this</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">whole other piece of the universe just</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">split off and you&#39;re never going to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">it again</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">and um it constitutes you know another</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">world different from our world</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">that&#39;s also not very satisfactory yep</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s crazy in fact i had a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">conversation with murray gelman one day</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">when i was out</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">santa fe institute started at lunch and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">then we ended up walking down to his</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">office and talking for about two hours</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">and we went all around these various</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">theories and he finally</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">used some words which i found that he</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">probably hasn&#39;t used with anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">since i&#39;ve found anybody else that says</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">they ever heard these words from them</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">he said you know jim here&#39;s one way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">think about it which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">take the many worlds interpretation do</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">the math</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">as if many worlds but by some mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">only one of those worlds is actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">realized and the rest just don&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">he said that&#39;s kind of a layman&#39;s way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">describe his own views</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">on quantum interpretation what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">think of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">yeah no i i agree with that well you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">know i did my first post talk with</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">murray and we spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">working on what&#39;s called the coherent</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">histories formulation of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">which can be thought of as a a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">a version of many worlds but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">just looking at the world now to say we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">split up into these different worlds we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">look at the whole history</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">of the universe past and future and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">we have one past history but our history</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">can branch off into many other histories</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">in the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">um marie and i were pretty much on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">same page about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">so i i actually agree with that and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">have a modest</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">and mild proposal about interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">here i think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">a lot of the the problem that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">have particularly physicists about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">the issue about many worlds is it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">in the the existence of these other</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">worlds in which everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">is radically different from the way it</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">is in our world i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">are they real or are they not we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">our world</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">about which we have empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">you know if that&#39;s the case i had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">delicious bowl of oatmeal</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">with homemade rhubarb compote</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">this morning and in another world i had</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">a delicious fried egg</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">but i&#39;m in this world right so i know</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">that i have information about this world</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">of things are the case</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">so what distinguishes our world from</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">these other worlds</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.959" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">is we have evidence about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">case in our world</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">oh i like to think of this in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">following and this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">physicists don&#39;t like this in general</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">but philosophers are okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like physicists want to believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">there&#39;s only one thing that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">and if it&#39;s there in the wave function</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">of the universe by god it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">the problem with that with many worlds</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">is that you&#39;ve got all these other</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">worlds that are by definition real</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">if you declare them to be so so my</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">my simple solution to this uh which of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">course will not you know many people</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">won&#39;t like if that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">is that really there are we should</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">distinguish between empirical reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">things that we know to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">because we have evidence that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">and then this kind of wave function</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">reality being real in the wave function</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">because the wave function of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">universe contains all these other worlds</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">where things are by definition different</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">empirically different from the way they</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">in our world and so there are different</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">things we have our world that we see</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">we know it to be the case and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">piece of the whole wave function of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">universe and then the wave function</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">contains all these other worlds</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">which are real in a wave function kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">of way but not in an empirical fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">and that for me is good enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s a kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">fudge i&#39;d try to get my head around that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not a fudge it&#39;s i&#39;m simply saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">that physicists want to say there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">one kind of reality right but</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">saying i&#39;m saying okay there&#39;s reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">is it just in the wave function</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">and then there&#39;s what was empirical</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">reality which refers to one part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">wave function</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not fudging i&#39;m just being precise</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">okay i&#39;ll retract fudge and say hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">that&#39;s yet another</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">interpretation i&#39;m going to try to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">my head around it later</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about another phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">which will turn out to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:10.839" style="s2">important as we dive into quantum</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">computing which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.839" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">entanglement non-locality can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">absolutely yeah entanglement is one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">those james brown</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">features i was at a james brown concert</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">long ago and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">james brown finished a song and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">somebody else somebody said james what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">are you going to play next</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">and he said i don&#39;t know but whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">is it&#39;s got to be funky</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">so as i said quantum mechanics is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">james brown of sciences it&#39;s very funky</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">and entanglement is kind of the funkiest</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">central funkitude</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">of quantum mechanics so so entanglement</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">is a very funny feature well finally i</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know about in the haha sense but</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">strange and counterintuitive feature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">where things can be correlated with each</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">other or have information</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">about each other and they have strictly</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">more information than you&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">classically and it shows up in ways if</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">an entangled pair of particles and said</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">let&#39;s say we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">we have two electrons and they have spin</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">and you can say</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">one is spinning clockwise the other is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">spinning counterclockwise</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">they can be in a situation where if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">look at each electron</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">on its own its spin clockwise or</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">counterclockwise is completely not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">determined</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">so if you measure it then you say hey</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">are you spinning clockwise or</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">counterclockwise</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">it will say you know in a chance fashion</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">it will say oh i&#39;m spinning clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">then if you measure the other electron</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that the spin is always</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">anti-correlated so it&#39;s in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:49.959" style="s2">way so if the first electron is spinning</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">clockwise the second one is spinning</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.959" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">counterclockwise</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">or if you measure the first one you find</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">it&#39;s spinning counterclockwise you find</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">second one is spinning clockwise now</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">what&#39;s weird about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">is that until you actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">measurement then</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">the electron is neither clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.320" style="s2">spinning clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">nor counterclockwise it&#39;s spinning both</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.320" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">clockwise and counterclockwise at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">in some weird and funky quantum</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">mechanical fashion that nobody has a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">good intuition for</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">and so when you measure the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">electron it has to as as</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">it were declare itself to say oh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">but as soon as it declares itself to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">clockwise you know that if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">go and measure the other electron you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">find it&#39;s counterclockwise</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s some weird sense in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">entanglement</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">as it&#39;s called that these two electrons</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">are in an indeterminate</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">but anti-correlated state and somehow if</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">you make a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">on one kind of thereby making that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">electron declare itself to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">determined state</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.600" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">let&#39;s say clockwise then at the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">instant</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">the other electron you know has declared</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">itself to be counterclockwise</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">and this is weird and strange and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">einstein called this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">spooky action at a distance actually he</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">called it in german</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">which sounds more impressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">and for many years people thought oh my</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:13.839" style="s2">goodness this is terrible would it allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">instantaneous communication from one</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.839" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">electron to another</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">though as it turns out it doesn&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">communications it&#39;s merely some funny</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">way in which the two electrons are more</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">intimate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">interesting yeah in fact people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">interested in this your book actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">does the best job i&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">explaining why you can&#39;t cheat and use</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">entanglement to send information over a</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">distance</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">that&#39;s the easy fallacy to say looks</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">like faster than speed of light suppose</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">we had</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">two electrons that were separated one</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">went to alpha centauri one state on</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">you did a measure on alpha centauri we</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">could tell here on earth some</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">information your book does a great job</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">explaining how that can&#39;t happen mother</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">nature just does not seem to want us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">act it&#39;s be the light</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">i believe this to be a good thing not</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">just a good thing it&#39;s the law</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">right if we talk later on about</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">about time travel i can qualify that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">oh dude we may not get there we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">now closely related to entanglement</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">is the concept of coherence probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">both actually rooted in the deeper idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">of superposition</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">talk a little bit about coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">how that&#39;s similar to and related to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">a little different at least from a point</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">of view perspective from entangled</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">again that&#39;s going to be important as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">talk about quantum computing</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">yeah so i indeed so coherence</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">is well coherence when referring to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">human beings mean that they&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">coherent case for what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">and uh i&#39;m i&#39;m not going to claim that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.120" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be coherent talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">coherence but i&#39;ll give it a shot</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">so in quantum mechanics the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:51.360" style="s2">coherence comes from</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">this feature that when quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.360" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">first formalized by schrodinger and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">heisenberg in the 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">it was about waves so schrodinger came</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">up with this wave equation which</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">said oh look you know each situation</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">each wave for instance electron spinning</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">clockwise or counterclockwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">corresponds to a wave and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">of waves of water or waves of sound you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">waves of water or the surface of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">water</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">wiggling up and down in a periodic and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.600" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">regular fashion</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">and so waves have a notion of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">if you think of a water wave that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">going undulating up and down</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s got a regular wave undulating up</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">and down and when you have two waves</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">that that collide with each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">they can interfere and the parts where</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">the waves</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">are both high become extra high the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">parts where the waves are both low</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">become extra low</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">and the parts where one wave is high and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">the other wave is low</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">then cancel each other out so the waves</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">interfere with each other in a way</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">that&#39;s coherent that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">described and all it really means is</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">that the amplitude of the waves how high</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">or low they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">just add up together in a regular and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">coherent fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">coherence in quantum mechanics refers to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">this wave-like nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">of quantum mechanics and the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:08.959" style="s2">superposition that you mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">simply means that when you take two wave</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.959" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">corresponding to two possible states</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">you just add them together and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">resulting wave is the sum of the two</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">waves</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">so mathematically and actually even you</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">know intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">and visualizing it that&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">on so you you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">states or waves coherence means that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">waves can add up in a systematic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">and superposition means</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">that if you withdraw a few waves then</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">uh you just add them together so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t sound so bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">the problem is when you try to relate it</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">to behavior of things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">electrons and and then square that with</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">your macroscopic intuition</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">so for example you know in quantum</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">mechanics the the amplitude of the wave</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">is related to where you&#39;re likely to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">find a particle so if i have the wave</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">corresponding electron</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">and the wave is really big over here</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:01.679" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">that means if i make a measurement to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.679" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">say where is the electron then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">going to be likely to be over here</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">or if the wave is really big over there</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">and i measure to see where the electron</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">is then i&#39;m likely to find the electron</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">well that doesn&#39;t sound so bad it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">it has something to do with these</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">probabilities of measurement</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">but the problem is because of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">principle superposition</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">in quantum mechanics if you have two</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">waves then not only can you add them up</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">if you add them up the sum of these two</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">waves is a perfectly reasonable state</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">for the electron</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">so you know the wave electron</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">over here okay wave with the electron</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but when you add them up you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">have a wave where there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">amplitude</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">for the electron being over here and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">big amplitude for the electron being</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">and what does that mean well means that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">in some funky quantum mechanical sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">the electron is here</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">and there at the same time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">pretty tough for</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">our feeble macroscopic minds to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">indeed and now let&#39;s make the turn</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">towards quantum computing because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">set the foundations is this funky</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">concept that the electron or the photon</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">or whatever it is can be many things at</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">you know how do we use that to produce</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">quantum computing</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">and how is it fundamentally different to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">classical computing</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">two big questions so feel free to take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">while to answer those two</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">ah well jim since you set it up pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">well i think we are in good shape to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">look at that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">really the basic distance between</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">quantum computing and classical</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">computing is what we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">that is quantum computers are just</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">ordinary computers you&#39;ve got bits of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">you code information and bits you flip</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">the bits in a systematic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">and then you perform a computation you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">process the information that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">classical digital computers do</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what quantum computers do but</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">because quantum</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">computers have access to this quantum</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">funkiness</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">then what they have is something more</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">than what classical computers have</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">in particular let&#39;s think of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">electron actually you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">classical computer the way you store a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">bit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">information is you&#39;ve got a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">of electrons you know you put the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">electrons onto a capacitor you put them</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">over here</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">and you call that you know zero you take</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">to put them over there you put them on</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">another capacitor you call that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">one okay and when you flip the bit you</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">say oh let&#39;s move the electrons</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">open a switch and let the electrons flow</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">from this capacitor to this other</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">capacitor</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">capacitor is just like a bucket for</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">electrons you toss electrons in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">bucket</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">and then flipping a bit in a computer is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">like oh let&#39;s take the electrons from</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">this bucket and we&#39;ll empty it into that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">other bucket so we take it from the zero</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">bucket we pop them into one bucket</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">okay fine and then you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">classical computers work is just simply</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">doing this in a systematic fashion let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">oh let&#39;s empty this bucket if this other</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">bucket is full and then let&#39;s fill up</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">this other bucket if the other bucket is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">empty</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.799" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">and then let&#39;s do this many many many</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:00.159" style="s2">many many times and that&#39;s what digital</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">computers are doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.159" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">okay what about a quantum computer well</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">quantum computer is like a classical</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">computer but</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">let&#39;s say we&#39;re storing a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">information on a single electron</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">so electron over here you know with its</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">wave</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">concentrated over here okay we&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">that zero</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">electron over there this wave</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">concentrated over there</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">we&#39;ll call that one but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">electron with its wave over here and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">that&#39;s an electron that&#39;s here and there</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">at the same time that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">a bit a quantum bit or a cubit</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">which is both zero and one at the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">again in some funky counter-intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">quantum sense which nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">understands</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s at bottom the only difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">quantum computers and classical</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">computers is that quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">quantum bits can be zero and one at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">by taking advantage of this quantum</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">funkiness</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">it turns out to have a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:08.640" style="s2">in the capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:10.000" style="s2">of computation right i mean the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.640" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">that we can in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">explore all possible solutions more or</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">less simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">at least for some algorithms give an</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">boost in their capability for instance</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">time i ever heard of quantum computing</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">was shore&#39;s algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">and believe it or not there was probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">15 minutes when i actually understood</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">shore&#39;s algorithm and worked through it</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">to really understood how it worked and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">go holy</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">did you maybe run through a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">how a relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">quantum computer could do what seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">impossible which is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">factor huge numbers how does</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">entanglement</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:52.400" style="s2">allow that to happen yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">we&#39;re just talking about how in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.400" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">quantum computer a quantum bit can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">zero and one at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">and then two quantum bits can be you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">know they don&#39;t have to be either you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">know zero one or one</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">zero they can be zero one and one zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">they can be in the quantum superposition</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">of the two states zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">one and one zero and when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">this state then they&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">entangled state</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">because if i measure the first one i</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">find the answer is zero then i know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">second one is in the state one</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">if i find the first one in the state one</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">i know the second one is in the state</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">so this this principle of superposition</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">that a quantum bit or cubic can be zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">and one at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">when you apply it to two or more qubits</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">you get entangled states</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">and this is key for uh using quantum</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">computers to solve hard problems</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">a good way to think of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">problem but remember that the state of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">quantum system corresponds to a wave to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">a solution to the schrodinger equation</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">and a classical computation all the bits</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">at any given time</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">have have a well-defined value</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">so you know each one is either zero or</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">but not zero and one at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">and you know so all the bits in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">classical computer at one point they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">like 0 one one zero one</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">one one zero for a small classical</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">computer but in aquatic computer</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">the bits can be zero one one one zero</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">zero one one zero</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">and one zero one zero one zero one zero</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:18.880" style="s2">one zero one zero one</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">at the same time again it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.880" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">understand how that works</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">in our intuitions but it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:27.039" style="s2">superposition of two waves</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">so a nice way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.039" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">this is a metaphor but it&#39;s very precise</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">metaphor because it actually has to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">with waves</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">is that a classical computation which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">of states of bits is so like something</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">gregorian plane chant like</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">where there&#39;s only one sound there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">harmony it&#39;s just a melody</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">one sound at each point whereas a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">is the superposition of many sounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">simultaneously it&#39;s a symphony</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">everybody&#39;s playing it once and if they</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">play at once in a harmonious fashion</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">you can make a sound that you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">never obtain or even know what it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">sounded like</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">if you just had a single cat with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">single note</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">so as i say this is a metaphor but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">a good metaphor to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">so what happens for solving hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">problems like schwarz algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">so in 1994 my colleague peter shore</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">showed that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">if you had a quantum computer you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">use this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">symphonic nature of quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">to solve a problem of considerable</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">practical interest</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">which is uh code breaking and he showed</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">you could use quantum computers to break</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">the commonly used public key</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">cryptosystems that we use whenever we</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">say okay that&#39;s fine i really want my t</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">and this sounds good so you do that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">this is very useful as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">and uh this is what happens with all</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">sure showed that by</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">uh being able to do something called</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">factoring</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">to take find a number and get given a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">number which is the product of two large</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">numbers to find the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">two large numbers which when multiplied</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">together make the first number</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">so you&#39;re given r which is the product</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">of p and q</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">and given r you want to find p and q</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the factoring problem like you</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:02.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">like 15 given 15 it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.320" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">oh 15 is 3 times 5. so</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">um so when the numbers get very very big</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">this is a very hard problem and short</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">short showed how to do this the way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">he he showed how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">is related intimately with the wave like</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">nature of how</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">information is represented in quantum</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">so if you have a wave like a wave in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">ocean</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">then the wave can have different</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">wavelengths and different periods</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">so when the waves are small the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">wavelength is short</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">and the waves wiggle up and down very</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">rapidly when the waves are big the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">wavelength is longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">and the waves are wiggling up and down</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">more slowly</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">so shor showed how to encode</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">the answer to this hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">of factoring and code breaking into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">huge long wave that stretches over</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">if you were to actually stretch it out</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">in space it would be larger than the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">length of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">but if you can stretch it out you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">kind of curl it up into the quantum bits</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">of a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">and you want to find the period of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:11.279" style="s2">wave you want to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">how fast it&#39;s wiggling up and down</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.279" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">and classically this is very hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">but quantum mechanically because quantum</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">mechanics is all about</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">waves it turns out that it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">possible in a straightforward fashion if</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.000" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">you&#39;re given a huge long wave and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">want to find out how fast it&#39;s wiggling</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">up and down</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">you can do that very efficiently and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">straightforwardly on a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s because quantum mechanics is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">about waves</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">to begin with so shore took this</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">wave-like nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">of quantum mechanics showed how you</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">could encode the answer the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">a hard problem by finding</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">the wavelength of a long periodic wave</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">and then showed how you could use a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">quantum computer to find that wavelength</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">and thereby factoring the numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">breaking the code</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very very beautiful piece of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">work and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">it shows intimately how quantum</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">mechanics actually works because it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">takes this very important feature of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">quantum mechanics this wave-like feature</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">ordinary bits don&#39;t have but quantum</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">bits qubits do have</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">and then shows that how to elegantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">solve a hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an interesting as i said i</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">understood it for about 15 minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">here&#39;s an interesting personal</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">story shore&#39;s algorithm was actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">central to a key decision i made in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">life how about that who would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">thought it right in 2000 i had an</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">opportunity to sell</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">my internet company to verisign the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">company that ran the digital certificate</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">which was based on the rsa crypto</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">algorithm that you just described</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">at that time essentially all the digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">certificates that did what you described</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">which would secure the transmission over</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">the web of your credit card to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">amazon were sold by verizon they had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">quasi monopoly with one small competitor</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">they eventually bought them out</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">anyway they wanted to buy my company so</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">one of the things i had to do as part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">the due diligence</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">we were a publicly traded company so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">had to you know be</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">quite public about all our due diligence</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">was estimate what is the chances</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">in some reasonable period of time that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">shore&#39;s algorithm will get implemented</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">in a quantum computer and break rsa</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">right we literally had to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">you know again this was 2000 so nobody</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">had any clue really about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">fast quantum computing would progress</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">but we talked to some people and i would</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">say in classic american short-term</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">business thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">we concluded that there was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">no chance it would happen in the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">five years</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">so we went ahead and did the deal and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">then interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">after we did the deal i ended up running</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">the digital certificate business how</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">so i literally had to worry about a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">convinced myself i didn&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">about it anytime soon which is a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">pivot actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">to the shores algorithm and many other</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">in theory are exceedingly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">to get that power there has to be a size</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">entanglement essentially or at least an</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">effective size of entanglement to solve</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">of size x right you know at the time i</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">think our keys were 512 bits long</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">you know they were like three qubits or</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">something at the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a long damn way from being</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">able to break a 512</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">bit key i just looked it up this morning</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">the minimum</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">specified key length for digital</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">certificates now is 2048 bits</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">and so essentially this rsa encryption</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">so talk a little bit about how the power</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">of quantum computing</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">is related to the number of qubits that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">are simultaneously entangled and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">let&#39;s start with that and then we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">on to the other pieces that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">delineate the effective power of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">absolutely jim yeah so a nice way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">i mean this is the power of information</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">in general the amazing power of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">information is that a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">bits</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">can have a very large number of possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">states so</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">you know if i have one bit it can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">either zero or one</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to call it zero one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">conventionally called it could be yes or</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">no or true or false or head through</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">tails it&#39;s just a question of having two</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">and then two bits well there&#39;s zero zero</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">zero one one zero one one so it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">four states and then three bits you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">got zero zero zero zero zero one zero</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">one zero</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">oh i&#39;m getting tired of it they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">eight states right</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">four bits have 16 states five bits of 32</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:43.039" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">ten bits of a thousand twenty fourth</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.039" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">dates</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">twenty bits have more than a million</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">states thirty bits have more than a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">billion states</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">forty bits have more than a trillion</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">states so the number of states grows</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">with the number of bits it grows</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">exponentially if i have</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">n bits the number goes as 2 to the n and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">that number gets very big very fast so</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:09.360" style="s2">300 bits well 2 to the 300 is around 10</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">to the 90.</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">10 to the 90 power is the number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">elementary particles in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">so with 300 bits you have enough bits to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">label</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">every elementary particle in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">universe if you could figure out a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">where to put the label so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">so the this is the power of classical</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">information was tremendously powerful</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">because it shows you have you have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">potential to explore</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">a huge information space even with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">relatively small number of bits</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">and the power of quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">means oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">if i have quantum bits and they can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">in superposition</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">and entangled with each other then i can</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">explore that same</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">huge space simultaneously so with 300</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">cubits i can explore a space where</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">if i were going to do this classically</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">on a classical computer my classical</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">would have to be the size of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">so it these the the size grows very</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">of course being able to control those</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">bits</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">and build a quantum computer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">harder</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.079" style="s2">so the back in 1993 before shore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.079" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">i made the first technologically</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">feasible design for quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">prior to that the first quantum</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">computers were proposed by the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">proposed by paul benioff around 1980</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">picked up by the famous noble lord</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">richard feynman in the early</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">80s and then david deutsch kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">codified the theory of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">computation in the mid-80s</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">but all that time nobody had any idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:46.879" style="s2">how you could build a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">quote from feynman at some conference he</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">says i&#39;m going to talk to you about this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">notion of quantum computation now you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">may think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">crazy and nobody has any idea how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">build these things but i&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">about it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">so back in the late 1980s early 1990s i</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">you know i wonder how you might build</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">one of these things and i started</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">working on how the physics of building</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">early 1990s i learned about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">called electromagnetic resonance which</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">is what happens when you zap</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">atoms with lasers or when you zap spins</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">with microwaves</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">and i realized you know you zap atoms</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">with lasers in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">you could build a quantum computer so i</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">i published a paper in science called a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">technologically feasible quantum</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">that was 1993 and in 1994 i started</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">folks to start making the first quantum</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">logic gates and the first quantum</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">and so it worked very well except the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">computers the quantum computers only had</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">a couple of quantum bits</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">we started with two cubic quantum</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">computer turns out you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">you know a do a proof of principle</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">demonstration of quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">with only two qubits which</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">we did the first algorithms with those</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">then we went to three qubits oh now you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">have eight states that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">then we went to four qubits and five</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">qubits then you know eventually</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">by the early 2000s we were up to like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">dozen or two qubits</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">and then about you shows you the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">progress is slow</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to convince</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">atoms molecules superconducting systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">to process information at the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">fundamental possible level</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">it&#39;s simply hard to do and so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">progress is slow</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">but then about five or six years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">hartmut nevin at google</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">convinced sergey brin it&#39;s like hey say</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">you know if we were to invest a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">million dollars or a couple of hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">million dollars and actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">building a quantum computer we could do</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">it the technology is there</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">and they hired john martinez from</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">and they went wild and they immediately</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">started building quantum computers that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:50.320" style="s2">had you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">you know 20 cubits 30 cubits 40 qubits</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.320" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">and then ibm and microsoft who had been</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">you know working on quantum computing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">for decades and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">to kind of like you know at a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">level they say hey google&#39;s eating our</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">lunch we got to do this too</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">so they invested 100 million dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">they started building much larger</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">quantum computers and then places like</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">you know intel and huawei said</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t even know what a quantum</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">computer is but we better invest in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:13.359" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">anyway so last five years things have</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">been going kind of crazy in the field</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">but the net result is that now people</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">have quantum computers with</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">you know on the order 50 to 100 quantum</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">bits they&#39;re still not big enough to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">factor large numbers and break public</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">key crypto systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">thereby instilling fear in the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">agencies with three letters in their</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">like nfo not that such agencies have</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">hearts</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">but anyway that they but so they still</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">are not there in terms of breaking the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">public key crypto systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s starting to look like</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s within shouting distance of doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">why has it been hard you know why do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">have to spend hundreds of millions of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">dollars to get 100 bits to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">jesus that doesn&#39;t sound too hard but</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">obviously it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">so what makes that a hard problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">useful to remember what happened when</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">first started building you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">conventional electronic digital</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">they were they first started with vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">tubes and then they started with</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">transistors</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">and then the computers that you had to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">put together you had to wire together a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">huge number of vacuum tubes or a huge</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">number of transistors each</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">vacuum tube where each transistor</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">corresponded to a single switch or a bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">and the vacuum tubes would break and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">blow out and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">some bit in your computer has blown out</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">where is it how do we find it</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">and so to build a a conventional</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">classical computer with a few hundred or</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">a few thousand bits also took</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">an apparatus the size of the room an</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">effort by a huge expensive effort on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">part of the government</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">and years and years to build so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">hard because you&#39;re you&#39;re trying with</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">competition it&#39;s hard you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">a system with many different parts that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">functions reliably</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">and you can control each of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">that just isn&#39;t easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">it was already hard to do back in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">1950s and early 60s in terms of vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">tubes and transistors</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">and now we&#39;re trying to do this at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">level of individual atoms</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:10.960" style="s2">the change in conventional classical</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">computing came with the invention of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.960" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">integrated circuits</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">in the late 60s early 70s where it</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">became clear oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">look we can actually have a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">way of putting lots and lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">and lots of transistors on a single</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">semiconductor chip and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">figure out ways to scale it up</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">and to make more and more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">while we&#39;re maintaining things</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">in a reliable functioning state</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">so with quantum computers the place</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">we&#39;re at right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">is more like the place where classical</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">computers were back in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">vacuum cube era of the 1950s early 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">where we&#39;re just trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">the basics of how we put together the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">different qubits</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">how we make them talk with each other in</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">a way where they can do so accurately</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">and come up with schemes for scaling up</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just simply hard to do it was hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">to do with classical computers as well</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a lot harder if the things</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">you&#39;re putting together or individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">atoms</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">you have to address each atom</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">individually you have to make them talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">pair by pair you have to zap them with</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">lasers to try to tickle them and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">convince them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">to process information the right way</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know not an easy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">do and it&#39;s taking a long time</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">moreover it&#39;s not even clear even though</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">you know huge progress has been made in</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">the last five years about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not even clear we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">there because just in the same way when</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">we had vacuum tube computers it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">ah this is never going to work you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">vacuum tubes are we have a computer once</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">10 000 or 100 000 vacuum tubes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">always going to be blowing out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">never going to make we can never make</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">this happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">so we&#39;re still at the stage where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">aspiring to make them bigger</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">if we can make them bigger that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">great i mean not just for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">for you know it&#39;s fine to to factor</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">large numbers break publicly</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">cryptosystems and thereby screw up the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">business of the world which is to buy</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">extra crap on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">how disruptive would that be but but</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of other great</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">applications for quantum computers as</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">well and those would be wonderful if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">achieve them and it looks right now that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">what we they might actually do within</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">our grasp</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:23.839" style="s2">you know i had a concept quantum</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">factor in the equation of how useful</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">quantum computation could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">you&#39;re right on target there jim those</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">are very important you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">think of how to build a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:01.280" style="s2">with actually looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">three-dimensional space rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">one-dimensional space of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">how many qubits you have how long can</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">you keep them coherent which</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">in the quantum mechanical cases how long</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">can you keep this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">wave coherent coherence of the different</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">waves making up the different states of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">the qubits</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:18.880" style="s2">because once they become incoherent you</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">have a cubit that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">zero that&#39;s zero and one at the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">time in this funky quantum mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">way it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s coherent but when it loses</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">its coherence then it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:30.880" style="s2">lapses into something much more</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">classical which is being either zero</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.880" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">or one which you can get just</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">classically</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s the coherence time which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:40.720" style="s2">how long you can maintain this</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">superposed wave-like nature of entangled</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.720" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">qubits</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">and then finally there&#39;s the error rate</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">which you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">is when you&#39;re flipping qubits from one</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">state to another</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">how accurately you can do that so right</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">now the numbers are kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">well we have 50 to 100 cubits and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">um the coherence times uh for</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">superconducting qubits are in the order</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">of one ten thousandths of a second 100</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">microseconds 100 millionths of a second</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">and during that time you can put in on</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">the order of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">10 000 individual qubit operations or</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">or q bit flips and the error rate so</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.119" style="s2">the precision which which they can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">done is currently around</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.119" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">99.7 that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the world record right</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">now for for the accuracy of an</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">individual cupid so</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">three parts out of a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">sounds pretty accurate but it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">that if you actually really want to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">something like factor a large number</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to need something like 100</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:46.720" style="s2">000 qubits</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be able to do millions</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.720" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">of operations</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">and to do this you&#39;re going to need</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">error rates that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">one part and 10 000 99.99</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">rather than 99.7 percent or sorry</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">accuracy that&#39;s not the error rate so</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">the error rate is one minus the accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">if you like</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">um so there uh we&#39;re still a ways away</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">you know we&#39;re still a few orders of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">magnitude away</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">in terms of being able to have the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">number of quantum bits</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">being able to do have the coherence</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">times are now very good</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">they will stay coherent for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">those are actually quite adequate at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">moment we don&#39;t really need longer</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">coherence times</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">but um though of course it&#39;d always be</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">nice but more bits</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">and and better accuracy so lower lower</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">error rate</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">and the great thing about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">you know we we have a goal</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">we can attain it it&#39;s great and moreover</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">it&#39;s in sight</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">you know making a we really basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">need a factor of 10</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">in terms of the precision for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:49.680" style="s2">the logic operations well you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">that actually is quite doable if we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.680" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">already gone up by a factor you know we</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">started out</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:56.640" style="s2">at 50 times less accurate than we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">right now we can get another factor of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">10 we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">number of qubits okay we need to go up</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:03.920" style="s2">by a factor</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">of 100 but we&#39;re up by a factor of 100</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">already from you know the early days of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">quantum computing too</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">so you know maybe we&#39;ll get there uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">very hard to predict these things the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">technological prediction is a mugs game</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">and in some areas some areas it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">maybe obviously moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">has been not so bad for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">i suppose the rate must have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">exponential associated with it with</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">respect to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">improving computational density in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">quantum world as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">of course the question always is is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">there a wall we know there&#39;s a wall on</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">moore&#39;s law one wonders where there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">wall or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">in the quantum world yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">interesting you should mention moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">law because you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">as you know but i&#39;ll just say it again</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.440" style="s2">is the this</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">empirical fact you know an observation</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.440" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">about technology made by gordon moore</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">the head of intel back in the 70s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">the number of bits in our computers has</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">been growing by a factor of two</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">every two years and at that time was</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">also the case that the speed of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:05.839" style="s2">computers was growing by a factor of two</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">the clock rate was going by factor of</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">and so the overall computational power</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.160" style="s2">of the classical computers was growing</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">by a factor of two or so</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.160" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">every couple of years it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">remember about moore&#39;s laws that moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">is it&#39;s not a law of nature it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">empirical law about technological</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually continued for an</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">amazing period of time i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">really started</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">back when people first started building</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">computers in the late you know mid to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">late 1940s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">and has gone on ever since for 70 years</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">which is why our computers are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">powerful by now</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">but moore&#39;s law if you actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">its different features none of its</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">individual pieces some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">exponential like the density</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">been going up by a factor of two every</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">stopped doubling just right after 2000</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">and the reason was very simple it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">it was doubling every couple of years it</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.000" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">was doubling</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">they&#39;re getting faster and faster and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">then starting around 2003 or something</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">like that when the clock speed got up to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">a few billion times a second a few</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">gigahertz</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like you start pushing it further</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">than that and the chip started melting</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s something it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">around so it&#39;s have stayed at</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">a few gigahertz a few billion times a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">second ever since so</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">not all aspects of computation</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">continue to proceed by a factor of two</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">every two years</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">and in quantum computing it actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really happened that way</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">in the sense that you know the number</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:37.839" style="s2">of of quantum bits that we have has not</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">doubled</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.839" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">every two years it&#39;s been a slower pace</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">uh which i think comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re really starting at the very</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">bottom scale and trying to put them</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">with in moore&#39;s law it was really an</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">observation but what happens is when</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a good platform</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">the silicon wafer and the etched chip</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">and then you proceed by making the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">materials more pure</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">by making the etching more precise by</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">allowing you to pack more transistors on</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">the chip</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">by process of miniaturization in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">case of quantum computers we actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">off at the most miniature scale already</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">and then we&#39;re trying to put together</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">more and more quantum bit per qubits</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of process</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">and it hasn&#39;t been obeying moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">as i said it&#39;s sped up a lot quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">recently which shows that if you invest</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">but you give money to smart people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">know what they&#39;re doing and invest in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:33.839" style="s2">good program for building better quantum</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">computers by god you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.839" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">better quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s cool we&#39;ll come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">different architectures that people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:41.839" style="s2">working on but before we do that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.839" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">some of the applications and algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">higher level approaches to quantum</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">computing</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">first what we&#39;ve been talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">i believe it&#39;s the field that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">active in</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">one can divide quantum computing roughly</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">digital quantum computing now what i</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">call the quantum circuits guys and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">put you in that bucket but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">some analog</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">approaches to quantum computing like</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">computing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">could you talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:15.839" style="s2">distinction between those two</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">yeah and do you mind if i talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.839" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">bit about</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">about you know quantum analog computing</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">the original sense of the word of analog</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">computing</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">or the original sense of the word analog</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">computing is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">you build a physical system like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">electronic system</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">and you program it so that it&#39;s dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">is an analog</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">of the dynamics of some system you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:39.359" style="s2">like to simulate may i talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.359" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">sure good i think i&#39;ll talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">first because i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">important it was really the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">suggested application of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">computers so back</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">uh paul as i mentioned paul benioff</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">first proposed quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">back in 1980 and in 1982 richard feynman</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">said you know a good application</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">of these quantum devices would be to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">simulate other quantum systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">and he said wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">had a box</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">with knobs on it and the thing inside</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">the box was quantum mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">and when we turned the knobs we were</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">changing the dynamics of the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">inside the box and if we turned the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">knobs to the right setting we would</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">this quantum dynamics in the box to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">an analog</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">of the dynamics of something we want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">simulate for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">we might want to simulate strong</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">in elementary particle physics or we</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">might want to simulate</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">quantum gravity and what happens inside</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">a black hole</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">or we might want to simulate what</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">happens to electrons as they hop around</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">inside a semiconductor all these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">very quantum mechanical kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">they&#39;re very hard to simulate on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">classical computer</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.920" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">because the classical computer has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">follow all these different waves that</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">are wiggling around in superposition and</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">there are a lot of these waves</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s hard to simulate these quantum</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">systems on a classical computer</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">so feynman said hey wouldn&#39;t it be great</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">a quantum simulator that could actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">simulate these other systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">and he was basically proposing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:18.800" style="s2">quantum version of an analog</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.960" style="s2">computer so how do we make a quantum</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.800" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">system where we can program that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.960" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">to be the analog of other quantum</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">systems and this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:28.559" style="s2">widespread application certainly for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">know someone like me who has a phd in</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.559" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like and doesn&#39;t understand how</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">quantum systems are behaving it would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.559" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">awesome to have a quantum analog</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">computer a quantum simulator that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">could use</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">to say now i wonder why this</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">superconducting system is not behaving</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">the way it should let&#39;s try another</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">design let&#39;s see what happens let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">simulate it let&#39;s see what happens if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">do it this way</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">that would be awesome so that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">application</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">and that is one of the applications that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">in fact is</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">for quantum computers that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">practical right now pretty much as soon</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">as quantum computers began to be built</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">you know remember i proposed the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">design in 93</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">ignacio sorak and peter zoller proposed</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">how to build quantum computers using</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">iron traps</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">in 94. i started working with hans moya</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">and delft</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">to do superconducting quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">in 96 and 97 first superconducting</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">were 1999 yasunov nakamura</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">shenzhe nec so these technologies have</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">been developing one of the very first</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">applications is this is this quantum</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">simulation</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">uh back in 94 i looked at its original</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">finding paper and said</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a great idea now that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">have quantum computers that are being</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">how do we do this so i started writing</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">algorithms for quantum simulation</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">analog quantum computers and pretty soon</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">i convinced david corey at mit to start</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">implementing these</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">and now these are one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">applications that people use for for</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">uh one of the most exciting ones is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">use it for figuring out chemical</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">and drug discovery uh these are</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:00.079" style="s2">wonderful applications for even quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.079" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">quantum computers and that&#39;s taking the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">quantum nature of a system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">processing information</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">and as you were saying before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">just kind of writing</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">the rules for how this quantum system</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">behaves so that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">it behaves like another system that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">want it to behave like</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">and and this is a great application for</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">and then you mentioned several other</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">applications for quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">that are not you know the digital kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">of quantum computation where</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">the paradigm or the most famous example</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">digital quantum computation is short</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">algorithm and factoring as we were</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">so um i i call this uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">quantum systems being quantum so</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">and and you know being quantum is easy</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:50.720" style="s2">for a quantum system but it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">for a classical system to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.720" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">like you or me</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">or classical computers to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.000" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">what it means for a quantum system to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">quantum and how it&#39;s behaving this way</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s what&#39;s called adiabatic</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">quantum computing where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">quantum system where</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">it always remains in its lowest energy</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">state it&#39;s so-called ground state</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">but you slowly change the parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">the system so it oozes over into a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">ground state</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">new lowest energy state and at the end</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">of this kind of slow</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">process of changing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">adiabatic means it basically means</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">moving so slowly you always remain in</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:26.319" style="s2">the ground state at the end of the slow</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">process of changing you&#39;ve changed the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.319" end="00:54:29.599" style="s2">parameters of your system so that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">final state of the system</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.599" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">encodes the answer to some hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t find in any other way</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a very cool use of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">computers and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">company d-wave that&#39;s been making these</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">adiabatic quantum computers now for 15</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:47.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s a great application of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a whole host of other</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">applications including the use of things</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">like light</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">and continuous variables things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">wiggle up and down in continuous ways</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">like the states of light interactions of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:04.319" style="s2">with atoms and matter to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.319" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">that can uh compute and solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t do otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s the one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.799" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">building large-scale aquatic computers</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">is not so easy</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">is that quantum systems give you</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">a huge set of possible opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">in ways to construct novel quantum</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">devices and have them process</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">it process information in novel ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">and the fact that they have give you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">great opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">makes it hard to take advantage of any</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">one of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">so i guess how would you say with great</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">quantum opportunity become comes great</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">quantum responsibility yeah and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">talk about that just a few minutes the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">different technologies</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">say there&#39;s many of them you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">quantum simulation for chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to put together an effort</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:00.880" style="s2">to use quantum simulation to find a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">better way to create</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">ammonia you know we think ammonia what</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">the hell you know but ammonia is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">main basis for fertilizer and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">huge</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">like 50 billion dollar a year industry</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">you can make it even 10 more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">and be a gigantic win</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">so those are you know some of the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">of things that i&#39;m hearing about</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">out in the hinterlands one more</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">algorithm i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">ask about is the hhl algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.960" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">and in fact what does the l stand for</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">about lloyd you were involved with that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">right could you tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">about quantum machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:35.599" style="s2">sure i mean hhl let me mention aaron</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">harrow or navidad in hastadine</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.599" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">who are the two h&#39;s there i called the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:43.359" style="s2">holy hell algorithm because hhl was like</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to pronounce for that so so</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">short proposed this algorithm for</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">factoring back in 1994</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">and it was already clear he used this</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">feature that</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">that you could use a quantum computer to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">extract the periodicity you know how</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:58.079" style="s2">fast a wave is</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">wiggling up and down this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.079" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">called the quantum fourier transform the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">fourier transform as you know is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">classical technique for extracting</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">periodicities</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:09.200" style="s2">and then alexa tayev came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">variant on shore&#39;s algorithm around 1996</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.200" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">and that was kind of all for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">while in fact the progress in building</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">quantum computers slow though it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">has been much more steady than the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">progress in coming up with algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">and applications and remember</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">that quantum computing works by taking</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">these waves</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">and superposing them on each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">adding up these waves</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">and around the mid 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.079" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">when again you know not many algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">quantum algorithms had come up</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:41.200" style="s2">i had the idea of looking at let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:42.960" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.200" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">kind of a much broader class of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.960" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">procedures than what people have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.480" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">so far so the idea if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">mathematics of how you take these waves</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">and add them up</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">the waves can be thought as what are</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">called vectors and a vector is just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">big long list of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">for a wave you can say oh let&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">take the wave and let&#39;s like discretize</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">it in space and each number tells you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">the amplitude of the wave at a click</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">replace like</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">the first number is oh the wave is zero</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">the amplitude is zero then the next one</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">is one oh look the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">wave is one the next one is two oh look</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">the next one is two</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">the next one is two again oh look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:19.040" style="s2">leveling off the next one is one oh look</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s going back down</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">the next one is zero oh look it&#39;s back</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:24.880" style="s2">down at zero so you see the wave we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">encode the wave as just a list of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.880" end="00:58:27.839" style="s2">numbers</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">and the advantage of quantum computation</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.839" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">here is that list of numbers can be</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">long remember with 300 qubits 300</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">quantum bits the list of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">is 2 to the 300 the list is you know as</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:42.079" style="s2">long as the total number</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">of elementary particles in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.079" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">so the advantage of quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">is that these vectors these you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">digitized version of waves</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">can be huge and then the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">the study of how these vectors operate</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">these long list of numbers is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.920" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">called linear algebra</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">and the way you add that you can add</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">vectors together that&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">quantum superposition in the case of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">quantum systems</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">and another thing you can do vectors you</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">can multiply them with by what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">a matrix which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:10.640" style="s2">just a even bigger list of numbers now</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.359" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">in the form of for instance</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.640" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">a square rather than just a long list</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">so linear algebra is basically the study</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:19.359" style="s2">of how you take these lists of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">and how you manipulate them by</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.359" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">multiplying them and adding them with</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">other lists of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">and a lot of what classical computers do</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:30.160" style="s2">is just this linear algebra</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:32.319" style="s2">and a lot of for instance when i teach</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:32.960" style="s2">my undergraduate mechanical engineers</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.319" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.960" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">numerical methods the things you need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">know for you know doing calculus or</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">building bridges or programming</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:42.640" style="s2">computers to do design</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">to understand you know the material</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.640" end="00:59:45.599" style="s2">properties of structures</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">a huge amount of what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.599" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">just taking these classical computers</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">programming in big big lists of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:54.640" style="s2">and then multiplying</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:57.040" style="s2">and adding and dividing them just doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.640" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">these linear algebraic techniques</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.040" end="01:00:01.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s a big part of both pure math and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">a very large part of kind of practical</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.760" end="01:00:05.520" style="s2">and applied math</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">with linear algebra so i had the idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.520" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like hey you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">these quantum computers why do quantum</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">computers do a good job</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s because quantum systems are</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">basically doing linear algebra</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.520" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">you know the state of a quantum system</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:20.559" style="s2">is a huge long list of numbers</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t have direct access to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.559" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">numbers in this list but the state</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">and when the state gets transformed you</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">know when a quantum system evolves from</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">one state to another</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:32.160" style="s2">these numbers change and the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">changed is by multiplying these numbers</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.160" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">by a big</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">matrix you know another big square array</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">of numbers</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.640" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">so the quantum systems the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">quantum computers are better than</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">classical computers for some problems is</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">quantum systems are hardwired to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">linear algebra</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:50.480" style="s2">so i had the idea of saying well you</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">know let&#39;s look at just some other</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:53.599" style="s2">linear algebraic techniques let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">what we can do</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.599" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">and one very common problem in linear</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">algebra</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.359" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">is you have a set of equations</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">in unknown variables and you want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:07.839" style="s2">what the answer is and meaning this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">out like like</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.839" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">2 x equals 6.</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">what is x right well</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:20.880" style="s2">okay in this case x is equal to 3.</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">so and then you have here&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.880" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">more variables x plus y</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">equals seven x minus y</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">is equal to two well i just made that up</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">in my head because</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">i knew the answer because i put it in</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s oh x is equal to three</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">and y is equal to one right that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">simultaneous equations from you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">algebra one in eighth grade</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">right exactly exactly and so um</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">you know we have systematic ways of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:53.839" style="s2">doing solving these equations</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.240" style="s2">actually these systematic ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.839" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">often called it&#39;s often called</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.240" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">gaussian elimination it&#39;s named after</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">carl friedrich gauss</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">and the reason it&#39;s called that is was</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">actually invented in the west by isaac</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">newton</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">but somehow gauss made some improvements</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">so they called it after gauss</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.280" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">and then it was invented in china like</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">1500 years ago or longer so it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">around for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">and the systematic way of doing this</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">everybody who went through eighth grade</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">into this knows it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">first we add together these equations or</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">subtract them from each other after</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">multiplying from each other to eliminate</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">certain variables</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:30.319" style="s2">until we end up with the answer oh look</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">it turns out y equals one</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.319" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">and then we plug y equals one back into</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:36.319" style="s2">the rest of the equations and we find oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">look x is equal to three</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.319" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">right and so uh that&#39;s called gaussian</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">elimination</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">and it takes some time and if you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">more variables it takes a longer time</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">and actually time it takes grows rather</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">rapidly with a number of variables</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">so i started looking at this problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:55.039" style="s2">like i wonder if we could you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">if the numbers we&#39;re looking for are the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.039" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">entries in a vector</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">the vector is a quantum state it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">a list of numbers</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">and we can write these linear equations</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:06.319" style="s2">by saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">oh let&#39;s take this list of unknown</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.319" end="01:03:09.359" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">we multiply them by a vector that gives</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.359" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">the kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">2x plus y is equal to 2x plus y</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">part or the you know x minus y part that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:21.039" style="s2">you can get by multiplying this list of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">number unknowns by</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.039" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">a matrix and then you say oh and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">equal to a known vector that gives us</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">2x plus y is equal to 7 x minus y is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">equal to 2.</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2">so then we have this list of the knowns</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">then we</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:38.559" style="s2">we are rephrasing the problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:41.920" style="s2">form of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.559" end="01:03:45.119" style="s2">ax equals b where x is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">unknown vector b is a known vector and a</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.119" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">is a known matrix so</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:51.839" style="s2">i said let&#39;s see if we can solve that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.559" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">said you know what</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.839" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">i know how to solve that it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">funny actually the way we came up with</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.280" end="01:03:59.280" style="s2">the solution so</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:03:59.280" style="s2">avinalton</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">and i just made them a big italian lunch</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.319" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">and the rule of coming out and working</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:09.920" style="s2">with me there is that you spend the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:11.760" style="s2">whole day you work really intensely for</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.920" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">like four hours i make</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.760" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">a large and delicious detail well i i</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">regard as delicious they may not but a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">large italian lodge</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">you eat it while you&#39;re eating you talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:20.960" style="s2">about other things you don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.960" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">but while you&#39;re washing up afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to start talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:28.160" style="s2">physics again</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:29.760" style="s2">we were washing up after the lunch and</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.160" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">and aaron said well so seth</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">are you have any problems you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">on i said yes i am actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">working on this problem you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">ax equals b and we want to find</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:43.760" style="s2">x is equal to the a inverse multiplied</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.760" end="01:04:48.640" style="s2">b and i said i can do 99</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:50.079" style="s2">of this problem because i can show i can</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:54.240" style="s2">solve the problem with the form</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.079" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">of you know i can say i can produce e</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.240" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">to the a inverse x where this is just</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">some you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">different version the same problem i</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.200" end="01:05:01.839" style="s2">said but i can&#39;t get to the last step</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">and aaron said</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.839" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">oh but that&#39;s easy and he explained how</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:07.599" style="s2">you do it and that was it</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:09.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a wonderful story about</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.599" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">collaboration exactly and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.920" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">of course then it took three months</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:13.680" style="s2">actually to get the paper written to</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">figure out all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">dot the i&#39;s across the t&#39;s and all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">epsilon deltas</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:20.480" style="s2">but then we had the answer to that and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:22.480" style="s2">think that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.480" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">i mean first of all it&#39;s a fun problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">because it solves a very fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:27.920" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:29.039" style="s2">in linear algebra that i think is great</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.920" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">but i think the other thing that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.039" end="01:05:33.599" style="s2">really fun about that work</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">is it showed it kind of said it was that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not just like they&#39;re just a few</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:39.520" style="s2">problems in linear algebra that we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">solve like this original one from like</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.520" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">finding periodicities from schwarz</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">algorithm it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">oh look we can we can solve equations</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">with a whole bunch of unknowns</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:52.160" style="s2">and then a bunch of us realized you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:54.400" style="s2">oh this means that pretty much all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.160" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">linear algebra which is a huge field</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.400" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">right pretty much all of that would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:00.480" style="s2">much much much faster on a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:02.559" style="s2">computer if we could build one</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.480" end="01:06:04.960" style="s2">which leads me to my next question when</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.559" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">i read about hhl i said</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.960" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">linear algebra what else is based on</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">linear algebra</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:11.920" style="s2">deep neural nets has anyone to your</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.920" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">attempted to at least design the</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">algorithms for what</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">neural nets might look like on a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:20.319" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">absolutely and that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.319" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">what we decided to look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">um was just so neural networks are you</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:29.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">a classical method for trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">figure out you know simulate on a</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.039" style="s2">computer in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">stylized fashion what happens inside the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.039" end="01:06:39.280" style="s2">brain and famously they&#39;re used</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">in very widespread fashion now</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.280" end="01:06:42.640" style="s2">artificial neural networks are used for</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.119" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">machine learning for finding patterns</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.640" end="01:06:45.680" style="s2">and data</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">because it turns out if you make huge</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.680" end="01:06:48.400" style="s2">honking artificial neural networks and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.839" end="01:06:50.720" style="s2">tune them</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.400" end="01:06:51.599" style="s2">turn them loose on gigantic training</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.720" end="01:06:53.839" style="s2">sets of dana</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">that they do pretty well at least you</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.839" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">know for extremely important societal</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">problems like</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">recognizing pictures of kittens on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">which actually you know i was a little</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">surprised that that when when google</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">was amazing that google was able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:10.799" style="s2">train a deep neural network</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:12.240" style="s2">to recognize that there are lots of</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.799" end="01:07:13.680" style="s2">pictures of kittens on the internet to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.240" end="01:07:15.039" style="s2">figure out how to do it but</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.680" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not that strange because</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.039" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">if you pick a random picture from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:18.799" style="s2">internet and show it to computer the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:20.400" style="s2">chances</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.799" end="01:07:22.559" style="s2">are that it&#39;s a kitten they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.400" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">relatively high so just guessing</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.559" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kittens probably going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:28.400" style="s2">probably do pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">um yeah so this is a great question jim</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.400" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">and and that in fact is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">primary proposed applications of quantum</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:37.680" style="s2">computers right now</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">is quantum machine learning in general</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.680" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">and things like quantum versions of</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:44.319" style="s2">neural networks in particular</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:45.920" style="s2">and i think here&#39;s is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.319" end="01:07:48.960" style="s2">tremendous opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.920" end="01:07:49.760" style="s2">because we have these fantastic classic</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.960" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">machine learning</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.760" end="01:07:53.200" style="s2">algorithms now you know it&#39;s no secret</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.000" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">that over the last</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.200" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">five to ten years that classical machine</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">learning has been going wild and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">accomplishing things that were</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:02.720" style="s2">very unexpected uh whereas previously</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">actually for the previous 20</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.720" end="01:08:06.319" style="s2">or 30 years it hadn&#39;t been working that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">well to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">somehow this threshold got crossed where</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">the amounts of data got big enough</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:14.640" style="s2">the computers got more powerful and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">methods were defined to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.640" end="01:08:17.040" style="s2">they could really do some pretty</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">impressive things</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.040" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">um you know not just you know uh beating</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">the world go</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">champion and go or recognizing you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">doing facial recognition or pattern</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">recognition or voice recognition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">kind of a lot of things are coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:33.679" style="s2">together um that doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">going to be willing to just get into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.679" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">that&#39;s driven by some big machine</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">learning algorithm and have it drive me</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:41.279" style="s2">around at 70 miles an hour through the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">streets</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.279" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">but there&#39;s still some glitches to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">worked out</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">yeah but the quantum version of this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:50.159" style="s2">remarkable as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:51.040" style="s2">and i think that that it suggests going</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.159" end="01:08:52.400" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.040" end="01:08:54.480" style="s2">um one thing that we&#39;re working a lot in</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.400" end="01:08:54.960" style="s2">my group is kind of a partnership</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.480" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:58.799" style="s2">quantum methods and and the classical</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">methods because as you say</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.799" end="01:09:01.920" style="s2">classical neural networks the way that</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">they work is</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.920" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">you take a huge vector a huge long list</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:10.319" style="s2">of numbers you multiply it by a gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">matrix called a weight matrix</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">and then you take the resulting vector</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">that you get after you know transforming</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">this vector</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">in this fashion using linear algebra and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:20.319" style="s2">then you apply some kind of nonlinear</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">transformation on it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.319" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">this nonlinear transformation is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.159" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">analog the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:27.040" style="s2">the computational analog to what a</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.000" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">neuron does</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.040" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">the neuron has all these synapses with</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">signals coming in</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:35.040" style="s2">those signals get processed in a way</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">where they get combined and added and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.040" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">subtracted from each other</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">in a way which is like this multiplying</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:42.159" style="s2">these signals these list of numbers by a</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:45.120" style="s2">matrix</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.159" end="01:09:46.400" style="s2">and then the nonlinear part is okay do i</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.120" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">fire or not</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">the neurons question is like oh well</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">yeah the if the inputs</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">process inputs get above a particular</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">threshold by gum i&#39;m gonna fire</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:58.080" style="s2">if they&#39;re not i&#39;m gonna hold my keep my</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">powder dry i&#39;m not gonna fire</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.080" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">so the nonlinear part is this firing</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.920" end="01:10:02.560" style="s2">part and the neurons the linear part is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.560" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">combining of a huge number of incoming</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:08.480" style="s2">messages</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">so for the quantum version of neural</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.480" end="01:10:11.199" style="s2">networks</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:13.280" style="s2">a really great application of quantum</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.199" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">mechanics is like oh look the quantum</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">systems are great at combining vast</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:18.640" style="s2">numbers of these signals encoded as</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">quantum states</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.640" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">you know adding and subtracting them</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">multiplying them by different numbers</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:27.120" style="s2">and putting them together</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:28.719" style="s2">let&#39;s take those and let&#39;s combine them</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.120" end="01:10:29.040" style="s2">with a classical device that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">the results you know of say classical</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">measurements made on these states</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">and then do these non-linear</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:37.760" style="s2">transformations</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">and this this kind of hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.760" end="01:10:41.199" style="s2">architecture uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the nice things about it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.199" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">you know it&#39;s going to be at least as</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:45.920" style="s2">powerful as either the quantum or the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">classical on its own because</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.920" end="01:10:49.920" style="s2">you know you could always just turn the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:51.920" style="s2">classical part entirely off and have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.920" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">fully quantum device or turn the quantum</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.920" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">part entirely off and have a fully</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:56.159" style="s2">classical device</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:57.679" style="s2">but by getting them to collaborate with</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.159" end="01:10:58.640" style="s2">each other the quantum the classical you</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.679" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">have a device</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.640" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">that is at least as powerful as just</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">classical or just quantum on its own</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a very exciting set of</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:08.000" style="s2">applications</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.960" end="01:11:10.239" style="s2">yeah it looks like an area that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.000" end="01:11:13.440" style="s2">to be well worth following</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.239" end="01:11:14.560" style="s2">doing that let&#39;s now turn to something</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.440" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">that our investor</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.560" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">listeners which we have some would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:22.239" style="s2">interested in which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:25.120" style="s2">the underlying technical substrates</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.239" end="01:11:26.080" style="s2">for implementing quantum computing two</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.120" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">of the big ones</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.080" end="01:11:30.239" style="s2">that seem to be still hanging in there</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:33.120" style="s2">is the two leading contenders are</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.239" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">super conductors and trapped ions i</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.120" end="01:11:35.679" style="s2">think you talk a little bit about those</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">two and then we&#39;ll talk about some of</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.679" end="01:11:38.719" style="s2">the others</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.719" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">question about i mean i&#39;m sure and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:42.719" style="s2">sure there&#39;s a lot of question right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.320" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.719" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a race to build the first</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:50.320" style="s2">scalable quantum computer who will win</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:52.080" style="s2">you know the you know the state of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.320" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">known universe hangs in the balance</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.080" end="01:11:58.560" style="s2">um that kind of thing and uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:11:59.760" style="s2">so yeah the i mean i think the first</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.560" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">thing to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.760" end="01:12:03.600" style="s2">about how you build a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.600" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">you know pretty much any quantum</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">mechanical system</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">makes a good makes it could be a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">bit because the whole quantum in quantum</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">mechanics tells you</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s this kind of discrete</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">nature this kind of digital nature to</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:20.719" style="s2">quantum mechanics at bottom</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:23.120" style="s2">so recall you know when i made this</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.719" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">first design you know back in 1993 for</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.120" end="01:12:28.000" style="s2">how you might build a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:29.440" style="s2">uh i scraped around for years like for</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.000" end="01:12:30.880" style="s2">five years or so trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:32.640" style="s2">how to do this because</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.880" end="01:12:33.920" style="s2">there was no technological guidance</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.640" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">nobody knew how to do it and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.920" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">finally i said hold but hold it you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:40.800" style="s2">really any quantum system will work we</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">can have an atom we&#39;ve got an electron</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.800" end="01:12:44.080" style="s2">electron you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.760" end="01:12:44.880" style="s2">over here that&#39;s zero electron there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.080" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.880" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">we have the spin of the electron</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">electron spinning clockwise we call that</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">zero electrons electron spinning</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:53.280" style="s2">counterclockwise we call that one</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:56.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be electron it can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.280" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">a proton or a neutron with its spin</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.000" end="01:13:01.040" style="s2">clockwise counterclockwise zero one</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:02.560" style="s2">we could have a photon which is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.040" end="01:13:04.480" style="s2">particle of light</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.560" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">where it&#39;s it&#39;s polarization you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:08.880" style="s2">wiggling back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.400" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">is zero wiggling up and down as one and</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.880" end="01:13:12.159" style="s2">that is the advantage that it moves from</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">one place to another the speed of light</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.159" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">which is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:15.920" style="s2">useful if you want to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.320" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">quantum information from one place to</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.920" end="01:13:21.199" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:22.400" style="s2">every atom has internal atomic states</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.199" end="01:13:25.040" style="s2">and these eternal</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.400" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">atomic states can be can be controlled</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.040" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">and changed by zapping them</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">with light any two atoms that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">interact with each other their</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">interaction can be taken to</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">perform a quantum logic operation</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:40.159" style="s2">and then actually so and this of course</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:40.960" style="s2">is the basis for iron trap quantum</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.159" end="01:13:43.280" style="s2">computing</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.960" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">that was proposed by ignacio serach and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.280" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">peters older in 1994</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh yeah look you can take or</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:51.600" style="s2">maybe it was 1995 i forget</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.440" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">it was a little after shore&#39;s algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.600" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">they said look you can take these ions</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">which are</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.320" style="s2">atoms where an electron has been</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:01.360" style="s2">stripped off as in the old joke</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.320" end="01:14:04.719" style="s2">you know two hydrogen atoms</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.360" end="01:14:07.440" style="s2">stagger out of a bar and one says oh</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.719" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">shoot i lost an electron and the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.440" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">one says are you sure</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">and the first one says yeah i&#39;m positive</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">sorry ha ha</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.600" end="01:14:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s terrible that&#39;s a groaner of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">first water</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.280" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">anyway you strip electrons off the off</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:26.560" style="s2">the atoms they&#39;re now ions</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:27.520" style="s2">they&#39;re positively charged so they repel</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.560" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:30.640" style="s2">and then you trap them in a trap that</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:32.640" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.640" end="01:14:34.400" style="s2">has both static and dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.640" end="01:14:35.840" style="s2">electromagnetic fields and you can line</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.400" end="01:14:37.280" style="s2">them up in a trap</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.840" end="01:14:38.640" style="s2">they interact with each other because</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.280" end="01:14:39.920" style="s2">they repel each other because of their</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:41.920" style="s2">positive charge</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.920" end="01:14:43.920" style="s2">and the they have internal states that</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.920" end="01:14:45.679" style="s2">can store quantum information for a very</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.920" end="01:14:47.920" style="s2">long period of time they make extra</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.679" end="01:14:49.360" style="s2">excellent quantum bits or qubits and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">then you can take their interactions</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.360" end="01:14:52.880" style="s2">effective direction act</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:54.239" style="s2">interacting and then by you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.880" end="01:14:56.000" style="s2">tickling them in the right way you can</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.239" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">really get these interactions to allow</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.000" end="01:15:00.080" style="s2">them to perform you know quantum logic</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:01.679" style="s2">operations on several quantum bits at</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:04.159" style="s2">once it&#39;s very nice</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.679" end="01:15:05.679" style="s2">very nice substrate for design for</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.159" end="01:15:07.600" style="s2">making a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.679" end="01:15:09.520" style="s2">the atoms are extremely coherent they</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.600" end="01:15:12.640" style="s2">have very long coherence times</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.520" end="01:15:15.920" style="s2">on the order of hours right</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.640" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">and so coherence is not a problem the</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.920" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">laser techniques for zapping the atoms</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:21.199" style="s2">with lasers for getting them to talk</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.199" end="01:15:24.719" style="s2">that actually those are very well</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:28.239" style="s2">developed and so you have very high</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.719" end="01:15:29.760" style="s2">accuracy gates with very low error rates</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.239" end="01:15:31.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re really the main problem is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.760" end="01:15:32.320" style="s2">just from the technical limitation of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:34.159" style="s2">putting</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.320" end="01:15:35.920" style="s2">ions together in iron traps once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.159" end="01:15:37.360" style="s2">got about 100 ions and a single iron</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.920" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">traps that&#39;s about all you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.360" end="01:15:40.640" style="s2">get into one iron trap</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:42.640" style="s2">otherwise there are too many that start</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.640" end="01:15:43.040" style="s2">all apart so then you have the problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.640" end="01:15:44.719" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.040" end="01:15:46.239" style="s2">if you want to build a scalable quantum</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.719" end="01:15:47.199" style="s2">computer to make it larger and larger</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.239" end="01:15:49.679" style="s2">you have to put</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.199" end="01:15:50.960" style="s2">more and more and more ions together and</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.679" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">indeed you need a way of having</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.960" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">different iron traps talk with each</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:55.120" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">and this is currently the technologies</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.120" end="01:15:58.640" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that are kind of slow</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:16:00.000" style="s2">processes of quantum communication that</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.640" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">take quite a while</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.000" end="01:16:04.239" style="s2">to move quantum bits from one iron trap</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.239" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">to another that i would say</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">is probably the biggest bottleneck at</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">the moment making large-scale</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:12.159" style="s2">uh computers using iron traps because</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:13.600" style="s2">the other features are great the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.159" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">coherence is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.600" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">impeccable basically eternity so far as</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:19.199" style="s2">we&#39;re concerned we&#39;re not worried about</p>

<p begin="01:16:19.199" end="01:16:23.280" style="s2">and the ion traps the coherence times</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.120" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">our coherence time is very long</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.280" end="01:16:26.640" style="s2">the the control parameters in terms of</p>

<p begin="01:16:26.640" end="01:16:31.520" style="s2">the performing low error rate gates that</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.760" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">still has a lot of work to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.520" end="01:16:36.360" style="s2">you know there remember the kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">benchmark you really want to get is</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.360" end="01:16:40.000" style="s2">99.99</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.960" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">there&#39;s still a nine or two away from</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.440" end="01:16:47.280" style="s2">that they&#39;ve got a factor of 10 or more</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">for doing that but that&#39;s in good shape</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.280" end="01:16:50.640" style="s2">there the bottleneck has this</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:52.800" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.640" end="01:16:54.480" style="s2">but this is a great technology for</p>

<p begin="01:17:08.320" end="01:17:12.960" style="s2">weiner got his nobel prize</p>

<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:21.360" style="s2">was early 90s or like 94-95</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.679" end="01:17:23.040" style="s2">or mid-90s a bunch of people started</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.360" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">talking about the possibility of using</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.239" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">mentioned my introduction introduction</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.840" end="01:17:31.880" style="s2">from this came from talking with hans</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.199" end="01:17:34.800" style="s2">moay</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.880" end="01:17:36.239" style="s2">m-o-o-i-j hard name to pronounce a very</p>

<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">better than my team so anyway i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.280" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">sure i believe that but it&#39;s great place</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.679" end="01:17:53.679" style="s2">and hans had the idea that you could use</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:56.320" style="s2">something what&#39;s called macroscopic</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.679" end="01:17:58.239" style="s2">quantum coherence that had been talked</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.320" end="01:18:00.400" style="s2">about a lot by um</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.239" end="01:18:02.080" style="s2">people like tony leggett who got his</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.400" end="01:18:04.719" style="s2">nobel prize for</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.080" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">elucidating how superconductivity work</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.719" end="01:18:08.640" style="s2">so the idea here</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.000" end="01:18:09.920" style="s2">is and other people by the way like as i</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.640" end="01:18:11.600" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.920" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">nakamura were working on the same id at</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.600" end="01:18:16.000" style="s2">the same time so the idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">of macroscopic quantum coherence is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.000" end="01:18:20.159" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.880" end="01:18:21.280" style="s2">so a superconductor is a state of matter</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.159" end="01:18:23.760" style="s2">typically something like</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.280" end="01:18:25.040" style="s2">a metal like aluminum and when you cool</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.760" end="01:18:27.360" style="s2">it down below</p>

<p begin="01:18:49.679" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">so the electrons once they start going</p>

<p begin="01:21:53.440" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">and you know what this worked like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.440" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">charm turned out that making them</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.840" end="01:22:03.040" style="s2">you know ten times as big which inside</p>

<p begin="01:22:05.520" end="01:22:09.280" style="s2">big in terms of the amount of material</p>

<p begin="01:22:09.280" end="01:22:13.679" style="s2">this meant that they became much more</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.360" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">coherent and there was amazing insight</p>

<p begin="01:22:22.320" end="01:22:26.480" style="s2">in these you know in the metals and the</p>

<p begin="01:22:33.199" end="01:22:36.159" style="s2">there are these little tiny defects in</p>

<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:40.000" style="s2">that are out of our control and these</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.400" end="01:22:41.679" style="s2">defects are what are causing</p>

<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:48.480" style="s2">now if you make the system bigger</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.639" end="01:22:50.480" style="s2">you think oh but you know now you have</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.480" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">more defects</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.480" end="01:22:55.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s true but what also happens is</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.760" style="s2">that the electrons</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.120" end="01:22:59.199" style="s2">that are doing the superconductivity</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.760" end="01:23:04.000" style="s2">their waves</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:07.040" style="s2">get spread out over a much larger volume</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.000" end="01:23:10.960" style="s2">and so each the electron experiences</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.040" end="01:23:12.400" style="s2">each defect to a much smaller degree</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.960" end="01:23:14.960" style="s2">and when you do a little bit of the math</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.400" end="01:23:18.800" style="s2">you find out okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.960" end="01:23:20.159" style="s2">you know the effect of each defect goes</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.800" end="01:23:22.400" style="s2">something like okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.159" end="01:23:23.840" style="s2">the number of defects grows linearly</p>

<p begin="01:23:23.840" end="01:23:28.239" style="s2">or the size but the effect of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.000" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">electron goes down as something like one</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.239" end="01:23:31.360" style="s2">over you know the cube of the size or</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.920" end="01:23:32.719" style="s2">something like that or the square of the</p>

<p begin="01:23:38.480" end="01:23:43.040" style="s2">and along with this this innovation</p>

<p begin="01:23:46.719" end="01:23:51.920" style="s2">superconducting circuits went from being</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.120" end="01:23:54.080" style="s2">100 nanoseconds you know a tenth of a</p>

<p begin="01:24:01.120" end="01:24:05.600" style="s2">to ten thousand even a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.440" end="01:24:07.920" style="s2">over the course of around a decade</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.600" end="01:24:09.520" style="s2">or less and that meant that all of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.920" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">sudden these superconducting qubits</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.520" end="01:24:12.000" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.600" style="s2">previously had been limited by their</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.000" end="01:24:15.040" style="s2">coherence times that was no longer the</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.600" end="01:24:17.120" style="s2">limitation</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.040" end="01:24:18.080" style="s2">an amazing wonderful technological</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.120" end="01:24:20.080" style="s2">advance</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.080" end="01:24:22.320" style="s2">and the thing about superconducting</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.080" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">qubits is because you can etch them</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.320" end="01:24:25.360" style="s2">on chips with technologies that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:28.000" style="s2">similar to those</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.360" end="01:24:29.760" style="s2">where you etch semiconductor chips so</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.000" end="01:24:30.400" style="s2">here you&#39;re etching things like you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.760" end="01:24:32.560" style="s2">aluminum</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.400" end="01:24:34.320" style="s2">and aluminum oxide onto the chips along</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.560" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">with other kinds of you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.320" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">transistorized controls</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:39.520" style="s2">you have a lot more flexibility for how</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:41.360" style="s2">you put the qubits together than you you</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.520" end="01:24:44.159" style="s2">do when you have ion tracks</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.360" end="01:24:45.440" style="s2">so now we have these two technologies</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.159" end="01:24:47.199" style="s2">and the ones that that</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:48.880" style="s2">that google when google when harper</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.199" end="01:24:50.480" style="s2">nevin had this insight hey you know we</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.880" end="01:24:52.000" style="s2">can do this we can wrap this</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.480" end="01:24:53.520" style="s2">up he said let&#39;s go with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.000" end="01:24:55.520" style="s2">superconducting technology</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.520" end="01:24:57.360" style="s2">the time is right for that we can build</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.520" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2">larger superconducting technology</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.360" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">chips and he listed john martinez at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:04.080" style="s2">same time john martinez had this strong</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:06.159" style="s2">vision for how to make this happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.080" end="01:25:08.400" style="s2">and they did and they made it happen and</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.159" end="01:25:09.360" style="s2">uh very impressive so the devices are</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.400" end="01:25:10.800" style="s2">remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.360" end="01:25:12.719" style="s2">buying traps haven&#39;t gone away there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.800" end="01:25:13.760" style="s2">an amazing startup done by chris monroe</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.719" end="01:25:15.280" style="s2">called inq</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.760" end="01:25:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of academic research on</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.280" end="01:25:19.600" style="s2">this where inq they also have you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.440" end="01:25:21.600" style="s2">100 cubits in their system</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.600" end="01:25:23.360" style="s2">and then they&#39;re actually the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.600" end="01:25:24.080" style="s2">because of what i described before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.360" end="01:25:26.800" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.080" end="01:25:28.880" style="s2">any quantum system is a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.800" end="01:25:31.360" style="s2">candidate for doing quantum computation</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.880" end="01:25:32.960" style="s2">you know i our conducting systems are</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.360" end="01:25:34.159" style="s2">the current front-runners in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.960" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.159" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2">but coming up behind them are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:39.360" style="s2">other technologies which have all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:42.239" style="s2">of potential advantages</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.360" end="01:25:43.840" style="s2">and are not yet as well developed as the</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.239" end="01:25:44.800" style="s2">superconnecting systems and ion traps</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.840" end="01:25:46.639" style="s2">merely because</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.800" end="01:25:48.480" style="s2">they haven&#39;t had as much investment for</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.639" end="01:25:49.199" style="s2">them in them and these include things</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.480" end="01:25:52.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.199" end="01:25:55.360" style="s2">other atom and optical technologies</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.320" end="01:25:56.320" style="s2">all optical technologies companies like</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.360" end="01:25:59.520" style="s2">xanadu</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.320" end="01:26:00.880" style="s2">or uh jeremy o&#39;brien&#39;s company</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.520" end="01:26:02.000" style="s2">sorry jeremy i forget the name of your</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.880" end="01:26:02.800" style="s2">company right now but it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.000" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.800" end="01:26:08.400" style="s2">new company using uh uh atoms and optics</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:10.000" style="s2">using entangled in different ways so</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.400" end="01:26:10.960" style="s2">there are a lot of other technologies</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.000" end="01:26:12.320" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.960" end="01:26:14.800" style="s2">currently in the form of things like</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.320" end="01:26:16.480" style="s2">startups that might very well have</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.800" end="01:26:17.440" style="s2">breakthroughs and leap to the front of</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.480" end="01:26:19.199" style="s2">the pack</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.440" end="01:26:20.719" style="s2">it&#39;s a little too early to decide in my</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.199" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">opinion at any rate to decide it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.719" end="01:26:23.360" style="s2">going to be superintendent systems it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:24.719" style="s2">just going to be iron traps</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.360" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">or one of these other technologies</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.719" end="01:26:29.120" style="s2">because they all have their advantages</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.520" end="01:26:30.960" style="s2">now what i stumbled across and i was</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.120" end="01:26:34.480" style="s2">doing my research for the show</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.960" end="01:26:37.600" style="s2">has the mouthful name non-abelian</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.480" end="01:26:38.080" style="s2">india ah apparently that&#39;s microsoft&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.600" end="01:26:40.320" style="s2">bet</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.080" end="01:26:41.360" style="s2">uh what&#39;s that oh yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.320" end="01:26:43.520" style="s2">wonderful i mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.360" end="01:26:44.639" style="s2">this non-abelian anions as the name</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.520" end="01:26:46.639" style="s2">suggests are like</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.639" end="01:26:48.960" style="s2">i have no idea what the hell they are</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.639" end="01:26:50.719" style="s2">but it sounds super cool</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.960" end="01:26:52.000" style="s2">exactly that was my reaction what the</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.719" end="01:26:54.400" style="s2"> i think i know what</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.000" end="01:26:55.679" style="s2">none means but i&#39;m not sure what abelian</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.400" end="01:26:58.400" style="s2">ineons might be</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.679" end="01:27:00.480" style="s2">right yeah this is a very beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.400" end="01:27:02.880" style="s2">theoretical idea that was proposed</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.480" end="01:27:05.120" style="s2">by the the brilliant scientist electric</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.880" end="01:27:06.560" style="s2">type back in the 1990s</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.120" end="01:27:08.239" style="s2">and he was using what are called</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.560" end="01:27:10.480" style="s2">topological effects</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.239" end="01:27:12.560" style="s2">topological effects are things like you</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.480" end="01:27:13.360" style="s2">know topology are things like based on</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.560" end="01:27:15.600" style="s2">knock theory</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.360" end="01:27:18.560" style="s2">right a knot is something what is a not</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.600" end="01:27:20.320" style="s2">well a nod is an arrangement of strings</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.560" end="01:27:22.560" style="s2">where you take a rope or a string and</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.320" end="01:27:23.679" style="s2">you you interweave it with each other in</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.560" end="01:27:25.440" style="s2">a particular way</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.679" end="01:27:27.040" style="s2">and once it&#39;s interwoven in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.440" end="01:27:29.360" style="s2">way the actual</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.040" end="01:27:31.120" style="s2">kind of like exact way that the string</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.360" end="01:27:32.960" style="s2">is lying on top of each other</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.120" end="01:27:34.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter what matter is is</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.960" end="01:27:37.040" style="s2">how it&#39;s interwoven</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.560" end="01:27:38.960" style="s2">and so if i tighten it up it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">same knot or i loosen it a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.960" end="01:27:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s still the same knot</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.400" end="01:27:44.719" style="s2">the knottedness comes with the topology</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.400" end="01:27:47.199" style="s2">of how it&#39;s knotted together</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.719" end="01:27:48.239" style="s2">and ketaya came up with this amazing</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.199" end="01:27:50.960" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.239" end="01:27:52.639" style="s2">there are these topological excitations</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.960" end="01:27:53.760" style="s2">at microscopic levels you have these</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.639" end="01:27:56.080" style="s2">systems where</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.760" end="01:27:57.600" style="s2">the way the system behave depends on its</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.080" end="01:27:59.920" style="s2">topology kind of the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.600" end="01:28:02.239" style="s2">knotted together rather than on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.920" end="01:28:04.159" style="s2">exact microscopic configuration of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.239" end="01:28:08.320" style="s2">system you know exactly where</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.159" end="01:28:10.080" style="s2">the the the electron is and so</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.320" end="01:28:12.719" style="s2">there are these things called these</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.080" end="01:28:14.639" style="s2">topological excitations of the feature</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.719" end="01:28:15.920" style="s2">that how they behave and what they do</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.639" end="01:28:17.440" style="s2">depends on how</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.920" end="01:28:18.960" style="s2">you knock them together and the way you</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.440" end="01:28:21.199" style="s2">knock them together</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.960" end="01:28:22.239" style="s2">is actually you kind of move them around</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.199" end="01:28:25.360" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.239" end="01:28:27.120" style="s2">i pick up one system and then i i i</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.360" end="01:28:28.560" style="s2">take it in a circuit like it takes a</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.120" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">little version to move</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.560" end="01:28:32.960" style="s2">all the way around another system and</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:34.800" style="s2">the way this is described if you do it</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.960" end="01:28:35.840" style="s2">in time if you imagine unraveling this</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:38.159" style="s2">in time</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.840" end="01:28:40.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like a braid i have you know the</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.159" end="01:28:41.360" style="s2">time the history of one system is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.320" end="01:28:43.600" style="s2">string</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.360" end="01:28:45.120" style="s2">here&#39;s one system that&#39;s sitting still</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.600" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">it&#39;s just like a string that&#39;s pulled</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.120" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">tight</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:49.120" style="s2">and then the history of the other system</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:49.760" style="s2">that i&#39;m moving around it&#39;s like another</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.120" end="01:28:51.760" style="s2">string</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.760" end="01:28:52.880" style="s2">but i take the string and i take the</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.760" end="01:28:54.880" style="s2">front of the string</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.880" end="01:28:57.840" style="s2">and i move it all the way around the</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.880" end="01:29:00.320" style="s2">other system so i&#39;m braiding the history</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.840" end="01:29:01.760" style="s2">of this system around the other system</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.320" end="01:29:02.800" style="s2">does that make sense it&#39;s hard this</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.760" end="01:29:05.840" style="s2">would be easier if i</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.800" end="01:29:07.280" style="s2">i had some props with me yeah it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.840" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">to get one&#39;s head around</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.280" end="01:29:10.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:13.120" style="s2">essentially quantum manipulation of</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.880" end="01:29:15.280" style="s2">topologies holy</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.120" end="01:29:17.760" style="s2">right so it&#39;s you you just by by taking</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.280" end="01:29:20.080" style="s2">system and moving one system around the</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.760" end="01:29:21.840" style="s2">other then that&#39;s a kind of if you if</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.080" end="01:29:23.440" style="s2">you unravel this in time it looks like a</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.840" end="01:29:25.600" style="s2">braid where a braid is you just have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.440" end="01:29:27.520" style="s2">series of ropes or strands of hair</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.600" end="01:29:29.760" style="s2">you pick up one strand and then you</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.520" end="01:29:31.760" style="s2">braid it around the other system</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.760" end="01:29:34.159" style="s2">properties of the dynamics of the system</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.760" end="01:29:37.199" style="s2">end up being a property that&#39;s braiding</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.159" end="01:29:40.400" style="s2">and so the the topological part</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.199" end="01:29:42.480" style="s2">is is the braiding part and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.400" end="01:29:44.000" style="s2">the fact that what happens to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.480" end="01:29:45.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a trivial way of</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.000" end="01:29:46.800" style="s2">braiding which is called abelian</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.440" end="01:29:48.800" style="s2">braiding whereas if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.800" end="01:29:50.480" style="s2">if you do it to one system then you to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.800" end="01:29:52.639" style="s2">another system doesn&#39;t matter what order</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.480" end="01:29:54.560" style="s2">you do the braiding in and that is not</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.639" end="01:29:56.960" style="s2">enough doing quantum computation</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.560" end="01:29:58.719" style="s2">the non-abelian part says what happens</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.960" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">to the quantum systems depend on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.719" end="01:30:04.320" style="s2">order in which you braid</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:06.960" style="s2">one around another and then the anion</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.320" end="01:30:08.159" style="s2">just means that you can do anything you</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.960" end="01:30:09.920" style="s2">want with these cis with these</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.159" end="01:30:12.159" style="s2">topological systems including doing</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.920" end="01:30:13.920" style="s2">quantum computation</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.159" end="01:30:16.000" style="s2">so the non-quantum computation with</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.920" end="01:30:18.480" style="s2">non-abelian anions comes from this</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.000" end="01:30:20.719" style="s2">braiding of these topological quantum</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.480" end="01:30:22.480" style="s2">systems around each other</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.719" end="01:30:24.000" style="s2">i know it&#39;s like i&#39;m trying to i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.480" end="01:30:26.960" style="s2">doing my best gem i&#39;m just doing</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.000" end="01:30:27.440" style="s2">my best i i can&#39;t can do no more okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.960" end="01:30:30.000" style="s2">let&#39;s hop</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.440" end="01:30:30.960" style="s2">up to how does it do on our three</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.000" end="01:30:33.280" style="s2">factors</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.960" end="01:30:34.800" style="s2">number of qubits decoherence time and</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.280" end="01:30:37.280" style="s2">error rates</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.800" end="01:30:38.080" style="s2">so great so that&#39;s the what is what is</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.280" end="01:30:40.800" style="s2">good about</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.080" end="01:30:43.199" style="s2">these these these topological systems</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.800" end="01:30:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the fact that the way they behave</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.199" end="01:30:47.360" style="s2">is insensitive to just kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.440" end="01:30:50.000" style="s2">microscopic state of the system</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.360" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">remember in a knot i can have a knot</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.000" end="01:30:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where the the it&#39;s knottedness</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.840" end="01:30:56.159" style="s2">and then the form that the knot takes</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.840" end="01:30:57.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter just like how tightly the</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.159" end="01:30:58.639" style="s2">strings are pulled or not it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.600" end="01:31:00.800" style="s2">matter you know i take</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.639" end="01:31:02.239" style="s2">you know i have a loose knot and i move</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.800" end="01:31:03.920" style="s2">a little bit of string to one place</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.239" end="01:31:06.080" style="s2">through another i poke around and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.920" end="01:31:07.679" style="s2">knot it&#39;s still the same knot</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.080" end="01:31:09.600" style="s2">even if i move everything around i like</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.679" end="01:31:12.159" style="s2">pick it up and i shake it</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.600" end="01:31:12.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s topology right but apology</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.159" end="01:31:15.440" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.800" end="01:31:17.600" style="s2">the what it&#39;s doing is insensitive to</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.440" end="01:31:19.440" style="s2">you know the details of the geometry</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.600" end="01:31:21.679" style="s2">right so the great thing about these</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.440" end="01:31:23.120" style="s2">topological computational methods</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.679" end="01:31:24.960" style="s2">and this was pointed out by kataya from</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.120" end="01:31:26.560" style="s2">the 1990s is</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.960" end="01:31:29.040" style="s2">that the computation that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.560" end="01:31:30.639" style="s2">performing is insensitive to the exact</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.040" end="01:31:31.199" style="s2">way that you braid things around each</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.639" end="01:31:33.040" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.199" end="01:31:35.120" style="s2">you know you&#39;re a little sloppy about</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.040" end="01:31:37.440" style="s2">how you braid the things around</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.120" end="01:31:39.440" style="s2">who cares what happens in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.440" end="01:31:40.800" style="s2">computation is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.440" end="01:31:42.719" style="s2">so the great thing about this from a</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.800" end="01:31:44.719" style="s2">theoretical perspective is these</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.719" end="01:31:45.920" style="s2">topological methods of computation</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.719" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">which are the ones being pursued by</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.920" end="01:31:49.760" style="s2">microsoft are intrinsically insensitive</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:51.600" style="s2">to how you do this</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.760" end="01:31:52.960" style="s2">so they&#39;ve got an intrinsic error</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.600" end="01:31:55.520" style="s2">correction built in</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.960" end="01:31:56.800" style="s2">already whereas in a kind of a more if i</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.520" end="01:31:58.080" style="s2">may call it conventional quantum</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.800" end="01:31:59.679" style="s2">computer like an ion trap or a</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.080" end="01:32:02.080" style="s2">superconducting system</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.679" end="01:32:03.600" style="s2">you have to perfectly encode the error</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.080" end="01:32:05.199" style="s2">correcting in by building a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.600" end="01:32:07.040" style="s2">more qubits by doing a whole bunch more</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.199" end="01:32:08.480" style="s2">error correcting operations and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.040" end="01:32:09.920" style="s2">mess</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.480" end="01:32:12.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s the real advantage of these</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.920" end="01:32:13.760" style="s2">topological methods</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.000" end="01:32:15.280" style="s2">and this was as you mentioned this is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.760" end="01:32:17.199" style="s2">method that that so</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.280" end="01:32:18.719" style="s2">there they have the kind of error rate</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.199" end="01:32:22.400" style="s2">if you can make it happen</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.719" end="01:32:24.560" style="s2">then you&#39;re in great shape and microsoft</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.400" end="01:32:25.360" style="s2">a long time ago decided back in the late</p>

<p begin="01:32:25.360" end="01:32:28.719" style="s2">due to the brilliance of michael</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.880" end="01:32:30.639" style="s2">friedman who said</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.719" end="01:32:32.000" style="s2">who there&#39;s a fields medalist you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.639" end="01:32:33.280" style="s2">the mathematical equivalent the nobel</p>

<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:37.040" style="s2">more prestigious feels medalist in all</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.679" end="01:32:39.199" style="s2">things topology</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.040" end="01:32:40.480" style="s2">he said look back in the 80s he was</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.199" end="01:32:42.159" style="s2">already saying look babe we could use</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.480" end="01:32:43.920" style="s2">these topological methods with quantum</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.159" end="01:32:46.000" style="s2">systems to do computation</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.920" end="01:32:48.080" style="s2">and then in the late 90s he started</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.000" end="01:32:50.320" style="s2">station q at microsoft back in santa</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.080" end="01:32:52.000" style="s2">barbara it&#39;s like let&#39;s make this happen</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.320" end="01:32:54.639" style="s2">and microsoft&#39;s been working on it ever</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.000" end="01:32:55.679" style="s2">since a beautiful set of ideas wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.639" end="01:32:58.239" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.679" end="01:32:59.920" style="s2">with these topological excitations which</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.239" end="01:33:02.000" style="s2">you know previously didn&#39;t exist they</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.920" end="01:33:03.760" style="s2">now actually exist</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.000" end="01:33:05.120" style="s2">uh the problem is they exist at the</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.760" end="01:33:08.719" style="s2">level of you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.120" end="01:33:10.239" style="s2">one qubit and they haven&#39;t yet been able</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.719" end="01:33:12.480" style="s2">to do a single two-qubit</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.239" end="01:33:14.000" style="s2">operation so for the theory side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.480" end="01:33:16.000" style="s2">fantastic from the basic</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.000" end="01:33:18.080" style="s2">physics side it&#39;s amazing the</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.000" end="01:33:20.639" style="s2">experiments done by people like you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.080" end="01:33:22.159" style="s2">charlie marcus or leo von kavenhoven at</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.639" end="01:33:23.920" style="s2">delft they&#39;re beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.159" end="01:33:26.159" style="s2">wonderful experiments kind of nobel</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.920" end="01:33:27.360" style="s2">prize character kind of experiments</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.159" end="01:33:29.600" style="s2">but in terms of building quantum</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.360" end="01:33:31.199" style="s2">computers the number of qubits is very</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.600" end="01:33:32.639" style="s2">small in fact they still don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.199" end="01:33:35.600" style="s2">have two qubits to rub</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.639" end="01:33:36.960" style="s2">together that&#39;s not much so then on our</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.600" end="01:33:38.719" style="s2">three-part model they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.960" end="01:33:40.159" style="s2">good on decoherence they&#39;re good on</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.719" end="01:33:42.000" style="s2">error rates but they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.159" end="01:33:43.679" style="s2">so far figure out how to even entangle</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.000" end="01:33:46.000" style="s2">two cubits</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.679" end="01:33:47.520" style="s2">well yeah so that&#39;s a problem now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.000" end="01:33:49.040" style="s2">possible they may have some some</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.520" end="01:33:51.040" style="s2">breakthrough in this but you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.040" end="01:33:52.239" style="s2">turns out that this particular method</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.040" end="01:33:54.639" style="s2">maybe because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.239" end="01:33:55.760" style="s2">beautiful and fancy and accomplishes all</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.639" end="01:33:57.600" style="s2">these other things you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.760" end="01:33:59.199" style="s2">get something for nothing so</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.600" end="01:34:00.800" style="s2">by having this kind of comp these</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.199" end="01:34:02.480" style="s2">topological methods</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.800" end="01:34:04.480" style="s2">you have to struggle so hard to get</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.480" end="01:34:06.560" style="s2">these beautiful uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.480" end="01:34:07.920" style="s2">resilient topological quantum</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.560" end="01:34:09.840" style="s2">excitations that</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.920" end="01:34:11.120" style="s2">the rest of the features like scaling it</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.840" end="01:34:14.320" style="s2">up then you take a big hit</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.120" end="01:34:16.880" style="s2">in that yeah no free lunch right</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.320" end="01:34:18.800" style="s2">now let&#39;s move on to let&#39;s jump out of</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.880" end="01:34:20.159" style="s2">the fairly straightforward world of</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.800" end="01:34:23.199" style="s2">quantum computing</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.159" end="01:34:24.000" style="s2">into the wild blue yonder late in your</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.199" end="01:34:25.760" style="s2">book actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.000" end="01:34:28.159" style="s2">it&#39;s in the beginning too and here and</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.760" end="01:34:31.600" style="s2">there but especially late in your book</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.159" end="01:34:35.360" style="s2">you start making some strong arguments</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.600" end="01:34:38.000" style="s2">about the universe as a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.360" end="01:34:39.920" style="s2">and some amazing claims about how</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.000" end="01:34:40.639" style="s2">thinking about the universe as a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.920" end="01:34:42.800" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.639" end="01:34:44.080" style="s2">solves some minor little problems like</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.800" end="01:34:46.719" style="s2">quantum gravity</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.080" end="01:34:47.600" style="s2">right which is the biggest question in</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.719" end="01:34:49.840" style="s2">physics today</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.600" end="01:34:52.000" style="s2">you know how the hell do we reconcile</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.840" end="01:34:53.760" style="s2">the macro sphere and general relativity</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.000" end="01:34:56.320" style="s2">with quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.760" end="01:34:57.600" style="s2">so why don&#39;t you go on a wrap here for a</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.320" end="01:35:01.199" style="s2">couple of a few minutes</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.600" end="01:35:03.520" style="s2">on the universe&#39;s quantum computer and</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.199" end="01:35:04.800" style="s2">what that insight provides us in terms</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.520" end="01:35:07.840" style="s2">of trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.800" end="01:35:08.239" style="s2">how the universe is well jim well this</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.840" end="01:35:10.400" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.239" end="01:35:12.400" style="s2">this yeah this is a story that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.400" end="01:35:14.880" style="s2">very important for me personally</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.400" end="01:35:16.480" style="s2">because the question of quantum</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.880" end="01:35:18.840" style="s2">information and quantum gravity is how i</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.480" end="01:35:20.960" style="s2">got into the field in the first place in</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.840" end="01:35:22.480" style="s2">1983-84 i was taking</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.960" end="01:35:23.920" style="s2">i was a graduate student in cambridge on</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.480" end="01:35:25.840" style="s2">a marshall scholarship doing this</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.920" end="01:35:28.480" style="s2">masters in philosophy of science and and</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.840" end="01:35:30.239" style="s2">i took stephen hawking&#39;s uh graduate</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.480" end="01:35:31.760" style="s2">seminar on quantum gravity</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.239" end="01:35:33.280" style="s2">at that time and said you know this</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.760" end="01:35:34.880" style="s2">stuff that i&#39;m doing about information</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.280" end="01:35:37.040" style="s2">and quantum mechanics can really fit in</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.880" end="01:35:39.199" style="s2">well with this quantum gravity stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.040" end="01:35:40.719" style="s2">i started working on it ever since i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.199" end="01:35:41.600" style="s2">been working on it ever since not very</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.719" end="01:35:44.159" style="s2">successfully</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.600" end="01:35:45.760" style="s2">may i say and actually nobody else was</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.159" end="01:35:47.679" style="s2">doing this for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.760" end="01:35:49.360" style="s2">and now just suddenly all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.679" end="01:35:50.719" style="s2">the last few years everybody&#39;s decided</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.360" end="01:35:52.320" style="s2">that quantum information and quantum</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.719" end="01:35:54.800" style="s2">gravity goes together so</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.320" end="01:35:56.800" style="s2">that&#39;s nice but in terms of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.800" end="01:35:59.040" style="s2">as a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.800" end="01:36:00.159" style="s2">the argument there it&#39;s not even an</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.040" end="01:36:01.520" style="s2">argument and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.159" end="01:36:02.960" style="s2">i know it sounds you know like</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.520" end="01:36:04.400" style="s2">completely overblown like oh the</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.960" end="01:36:04.880" style="s2">universe is a big quantum computer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.400" end="01:36:06.639" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.880" end="01:36:08.000" style="s2">oh when you study quantum computation</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.639" end="01:36:09.440" style="s2">everything&#39;s a quantum computer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.000" end="01:36:10.880" style="s2">like when you&#39;ve got a hammer everything</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.440" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">looks like a nail</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.880" end="01:36:14.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s not really that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.239" end="01:36:16.239" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here it&#39;s really has to</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.400" end="01:36:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s related to what i was describing</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.239" end="01:36:18.719" style="s2">earlier about how you build quantum</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.600" end="01:36:20.960" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.719" end="01:36:22.400" style="s2">so in figuring out how to build chronic</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.960" end="01:36:24.000" style="s2">computers in the first place i was like</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.400" end="01:36:25.679" style="s2">i wonder what kind of would be a good</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.000" end="01:36:27.119" style="s2">like you know substrate for building</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.679" end="01:36:29.360" style="s2">quantum computer and that was like</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.119" end="01:36:30.400" style="s2">huh you know could be anything because</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.360" end="01:36:32.080" style="s2">everything out there</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.400" end="01:36:34.159" style="s2">in the universe you know every atom</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.080" end="01:36:36.000" style="s2">every elementary particle every electron</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.159" end="01:36:38.960" style="s2">every quark every photon</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.000" end="01:36:39.520" style="s2">carries with it quantum information and</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.960" end="01:36:42.159" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.520" end="01:36:43.679" style="s2">different atoms electrons photons quarks</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.159" end="01:36:45.600" style="s2">interact with each other</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.679" end="01:36:46.880" style="s2">that information is changed and</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.600" end="01:36:49.679" style="s2">transformed</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.880" end="01:36:51.600" style="s2">and so the carrying information you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.679" end="01:36:52.639" style="s2">registering information in a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.600" end="01:36:54.880" style="s2">mechanical fashion</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.639" end="01:36:56.159" style="s2">every individual piece of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.880" end="01:36:58.239" style="s2">does that</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.159" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">and then when two pieces of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.239" end="01:37:01.760" style="s2">interact with each other your two</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.520" end="01:37:02.560" style="s2">elementary particles bounce off of each</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.760" end="01:37:04.239" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.560" end="01:37:06.080" style="s2">that information that they carry is</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.239" end="01:37:07.679" style="s2">processed and transformed</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.080" end="01:37:09.600" style="s2">so when we build a quantum computer all</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.679" end="01:37:11.440" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is just accepting the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.600" end="01:37:13.119" style="s2">reality that everything out there in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.440" end="01:37:15.520" style="s2">universe is already</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.119" end="01:37:17.920" style="s2">registering quantum information and</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.520" end="01:37:19.360" style="s2">processing it in a systematic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.920" end="01:37:20.960" style="s2">so to build a quantum computer what we</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.360" end="01:37:22.480" style="s2">need to do is kind of hack into this</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.960" end="01:37:24.400" style="s2">ongoing computation</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.480" end="01:37:27.280" style="s2">and see if we can&#39;t you know by tickling</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.400" end="01:37:30.000" style="s2">things with lasers or mazers or you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.280" end="01:37:32.880" style="s2">or like by electric potentials and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.000" end="01:37:35.520" style="s2">if we can&#39;t kind of guide this ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.880" end="01:37:37.040" style="s2">computation towards directions to doing</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.520" end="01:37:38.960" style="s2">things that we&#39;d like to do like quantum</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.040" end="01:37:41.360" style="s2">stimulation or factoring</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.960" end="01:37:42.880" style="s2">so my realization that the universe was</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.360" end="01:37:43.600" style="s2">really the whole thing was a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.880" end="01:37:45.520" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.600" end="01:37:46.719" style="s2">really came from this very practical</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.520" end="01:37:48.480" style="s2">engineering challenge</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.719" end="01:37:50.239" style="s2">like hey how do we build a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.480" end="01:37:52.159" style="s2">computer what can we use oh we can use</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.239" end="01:37:53.760" style="s2">anything we want because they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.159" end="01:37:56.000" style="s2">processing information in a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.760" end="01:37:56.480" style="s2">mechanical fashion these electrons are</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.000" end="01:37:58.560" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.480" end="01:37:59.840" style="s2">effectively computing and what we need</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.560" end="01:38:02.400" style="s2">to do is not you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.840" end="01:38:03.360" style="s2">make them compute or exploit them to</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.400" end="01:38:04.960" style="s2">make them compute</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.360" end="01:38:06.880" style="s2">we need to recognize that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.960" end="01:38:07.920" style="s2">already computing and processing</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.880" end="01:38:10.320" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.920" end="01:38:11.840" style="s2">and then intervene into this this</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.320" end="01:38:13.360" style="s2">computation they&#39;re already performing</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.840" end="01:38:15.600" style="s2">to program them</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.360" end="01:38:17.280" style="s2">to do something different and something</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.600" end="01:38:18.800" style="s2">we&#39;d like them to do hence the title of</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.280" end="01:38:20.960" style="s2">my book programming</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.800" end="01:38:22.639" style="s2">the universe you know when we were</p>

<p begin="01:38:24.800" end="01:38:26.960" style="s2">something that the universe wasn&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.239" end="01:38:28.639" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.960" end="01:38:30.560" style="s2">we&#39;re simply intervening in part of the</p>

<p begin="01:38:30.560" end="01:38:34.320" style="s2">a complication we&#39;d like it to perform</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.280" end="01:38:36.400" style="s2">and if you ask</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.320" end="01:38:38.320" style="s2">electrons and atoms and through chronic</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.400" end="01:38:39.600" style="s2">interpretation the right way very nicely</p>

<p begin="01:38:39.600" end="01:38:43.360" style="s2">tickle them with light in the right</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.440" end="01:38:44.719" style="s2">fashion by gum they&#39;re going to do that</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.360" end="01:38:46.400" style="s2">for you and that&#39;s what&#39;s happening with</p>

<p begin="01:38:46.400" end="01:38:49.920" style="s2">so when you actually think of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.000" end="01:38:51.280" style="s2">universe as a as a quantum computer i</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.920" end="01:38:52.960" style="s2">actually would say it&#39;s not you know a</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.280" end="01:38:55.199" style="s2">metaphor it&#39;s just a fact</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.960" end="01:38:57.040" style="s2">right it every piece of the universe is</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.199" end="01:38:58.719" style="s2">registered information</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.040" end="01:39:01.280" style="s2">you know when pieces of the universe are</p>

<p begin="01:39:05.760" end="01:39:08.800" style="s2">and the universe is processing</p>

<p begin="01:39:10.639" end="01:39:14.159" style="s2">not a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.719" end="01:39:16.639" style="s2">but some of the implications that you</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.159" end="01:39:18.960" style="s2">take from that are quite astounding</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.639" end="01:39:20.320" style="s2">well i mean you know you take this facts</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.960" end="01:39:21.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to just call it a fact</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.320" end="01:39:22.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s a fact</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.520" end="01:39:25.360" style="s2">and you say well what are the</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.880" end="01:39:27.679" style="s2">implications for this well one you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.360" end="01:39:29.280" style="s2">implication you said as well maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.679" end="01:39:31.600" style="s2">could understand this</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.280" end="01:39:33.280" style="s2">famous unsolved hundred-year-old</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.600" end="01:39:35.440" style="s2">unsolved question about how you make a</p>

<p begin="01:39:35.440" end="01:39:38.719" style="s2">using ideas from quantum information</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.280" end="01:39:41.280" style="s2">processing that would be great</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.719" end="01:39:42.639" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve been working on this since</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.280" end="01:39:46.159" style="s2">early 80s</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.639" end="01:39:48.639" style="s2">and you know making progress slow</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.159" end="01:39:51.040" style="s2">and not even steady slipping backwards</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.639" end="01:39:52.800" style="s2">and more recently people like</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.040" end="01:39:54.639" style="s2">lenny suskin you know the last few years</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.800" end="01:39:56.159" style="s2">have advocated doing this</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.639" end="01:39:57.840" style="s2">um and now there are a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.159" end="01:39:58.560" style="s2">working on this problem maybe we&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.840" end="01:40:00.400" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.560" end="01:40:01.920" style="s2">quantum mechanics and gravity is a more</p>

<p begin="01:40:01.920" end="01:40:05.760" style="s2">and indeed a few years ago at the at the</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.320" end="01:40:07.760" style="s2">100th anniversary</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.760" end="01:40:09.040" style="s2">of einstein&#39;s discovery of the theory of</p>

<p begin="01:40:11.040" end="01:40:14.880" style="s2">do quantum gravity we said</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.400" end="01:40:16.080" style="s2">let&#39;s have a conference entitled a</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.880" end="01:40:18.370" style="s2">hundred years of</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.080" end="01:40:21.119" style="s2">failing to quantize gravity</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.370" end="01:40:22.960" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.119" end="01:40:24.320" style="s2">because let&#39;s face it we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.960" end="01:40:25.920" style="s2">know how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.320" end="01:40:27.520" style="s2">and if someone tells you you know they</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.920" end="01:40:29.520" style="s2">know how to do it it just merely means</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.520" end="01:40:32.080" style="s2">that they&#39;re a string theorists</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.520" end="01:40:33.840" style="s2">but i think that there&#39;s actually you</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.080" end="01:40:35.280" style="s2">know so it could be helpful for that</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.840" end="01:40:37.199" style="s2">that would be great</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.280" end="01:40:38.639" style="s2">i think there&#39;s one aspect of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.199" end="01:40:40.960" style="s2">that the universe is</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.639" end="01:40:42.159" style="s2">in fact a big quantum computer that is</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.960" end="01:40:42.960" style="s2">really amazing and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.159" end="01:40:45.280" style="s2">implication</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.960" end="01:40:46.480" style="s2">of that that is remarkable and does</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.280" end="01:40:48.239" style="s2">explain something</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.480" end="01:40:49.679" style="s2">that is very beautiful and profound</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.239" end="01:40:53.360" style="s2">about the universe</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.679" end="01:40:54.880" style="s2">which is why the universe is so complex</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.360" end="01:40:56.800" style="s2">ah i was going to ask you that was going</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.880" end="01:40:57.280" style="s2">to be my next topic let&#39;s just roll with</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.800" end="01:40:59.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.280" end="01:41:01.040" style="s2">this will be our last topic and then we</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.520" end="01:41:03.119" style="s2">will wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.040" end="01:41:04.560" style="s2">good so let&#39;s just move into that</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.119" end="01:41:05.760" style="s2">because this is a very wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.560" end="01:41:07.199" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.760" end="01:41:09.040" style="s2">and people have been asking this</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.199" end="01:41:10.400" style="s2">question as look for as long as they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.040" end="01:41:12.800" style="s2">been people you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.400" end="01:41:13.840" style="s2">you stare up at the night sky what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.800" end="01:41:16.000" style="s2">going on out there</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.840" end="01:41:17.440" style="s2">what what are all these stars you look</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.000" end="01:41:18.080" style="s2">at the world around you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.440" end="01:41:19.920" style="s2">what is all</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.080" end="01:41:21.840" style="s2">are all these living things my god look</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.920" end="01:41:22.560" style="s2">at human beings what the heck is going</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.840" end="01:41:24.320" style="s2">on here</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.560" end="01:41:25.600" style="s2">it&#39;s totally out of control with</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.320" end="01:41:28.480" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.600" end="01:41:29.520" style="s2">where did that come from a very</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.480" end="01:41:31.520" style="s2">mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.520" end="01:41:33.119" style="s2">question that&#39;s very hard to answer and</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.520" end="01:41:35.840" style="s2">you know in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.119" end="01:41:37.440" style="s2">is this question is that the basis for</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.840" end="01:41:40.320" style="s2">organized religion</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.440" end="01:41:41.679" style="s2">disorganized religion personal religion</p>

<p begin="01:41:41.679" end="01:41:45.520" style="s2">and you know people in science have been</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.320" end="01:41:46.719" style="s2">scientists have been trying to answer</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.520" end="01:41:49.440" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.719" end="01:41:50.560" style="s2">for hundreds of years as well also</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.440" end="01:41:51.679" style="s2">failing to do so</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.560" end="01:41:53.440" style="s2">actually from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.679" end="01:41:54.080" style="s2">physics it&#39;s particularly mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.440" end="01:41:55.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.080" end="01:41:57.520" style="s2">one of the features of physics is when</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.760" end="01:42:00.000" style="s2">you look at things at their most</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.520" end="01:42:01.920" style="s2">fundamental level they look simple</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.000" end="01:42:03.520" style="s2">you know the standard model for</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.920" end="01:42:06.639" style="s2">elementary particles</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.520" end="01:42:08.719" style="s2">fits on a t-shirt it&#39;s simple</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.639" end="01:42:10.800" style="s2">how do you have these simple laws and</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.719" end="01:42:14.080" style="s2">get all this complex stuff</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.800" end="01:42:15.440" style="s2">coming out of it well the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.080" end="01:42:16.320" style="s2">universe is performing a quantum</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.440" end="01:42:18.000" style="s2">computation</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.320" end="01:42:20.960" style="s2">actually provides an explanation for</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.000" end="01:42:23.199" style="s2">this because a computer at bottom</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.960" end="01:42:24.239" style="s2">is in fact a simple thing the dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.199" end="01:42:26.400" style="s2">of a computer</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.239" end="01:42:28.719" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a simple the computer it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.400" end="01:42:30.080" style="s2">information in it stored in bits</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.719" end="01:42:32.320" style="s2">and the quantum computer is stored in</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.080" end="01:42:33.920" style="s2">quantum bits or qubits that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.320" end="01:42:35.440" style="s2">bit is a very simple thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.920" end="01:42:37.040" style="s2">something that has two possible states</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.440" end="01:42:37.440" style="s2">which we just happen to call zero and</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.040" end="01:42:39.760" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.440" end="01:42:41.760" style="s2">or electron here an electron there and</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.760" end="01:42:43.600" style="s2">then the the elementary logical</p>

<p begin="01:42:43.600" end="01:42:45.840" style="s2">are built</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.159" end="01:42:47.119" style="s2">are also very simple it&#39;s like oh we</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.840" end="01:42:48.960" style="s2">just flipped the bit we move the</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.119" end="01:42:50.960" style="s2">electron from here to there or</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.960" end="01:42:52.159" style="s2">you know we have a we flip this bit if</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.960" end="01:42:53.520" style="s2">this other bit is one</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.159" end="01:42:54.880" style="s2">oh we only flipped the bit at the other</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.520" end="01:42:56.080" style="s2">bit as one that&#39;s called controlled not</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.880" end="01:42:58.400" style="s2">non-operation</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.080" end="01:42:59.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple logical operation and</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.400" end="01:43:01.600" style="s2">if you look at the most complicated</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.920" end="01:43:04.159" style="s2">computations you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.600" end="01:43:05.119" style="s2">that involve bajillions of bits a</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.159" end="01:43:07.040" style="s2">technical term</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.119" end="01:43:09.199" style="s2">and performing gajillions of logical</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.040" end="01:43:12.320" style="s2">operations that&#39;s also a technical term</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.199" end="01:43:14.400" style="s2">all it is is a lot of bits and flipping</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.320" end="01:43:17.280" style="s2">these bits in a systematic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.400" end="01:43:18.159" style="s2">well that&#39;s a computation and out of a</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.280" end="01:43:20.639" style="s2">computation</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.159" end="01:43:22.480" style="s2">even though the actual dynamics and</p>

<p begin="01:43:22.480" end="01:43:26.639" style="s2">computation is simple</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.080" end="01:43:28.960" style="s2">just bits bits interacting with each</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.639" end="01:43:30.719" style="s2">other bits flipping in a systematic way</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.960" end="01:43:32.000" style="s2">you can get very very very very</p>

<p begin="01:43:34.320" end="01:43:38.880" style="s2">so this is great because this tells us</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.840" end="01:43:42.080" style="s2">how we can get</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.880" end="01:43:44.480" style="s2">a universe that has very simple laws</p>

<p begin="01:43:51.679" end="01:43:57.760" style="s2">and yet it can spontaneously generate</p>

<p begin="01:43:58.239" end="01:44:01.840" style="s2">would like to think about and for this</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.480" end="01:44:03.679" style="s2">we just need a little extra bit of</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.840" end="01:44:04.800" style="s2">mathematics and the mathematics is very</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.679" end="01:44:06.639" style="s2">simple it says</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.800" end="01:44:08.159" style="s2">we take something that&#39;s capable of</p>

<p begin="01:44:08.159" end="01:44:12.960" style="s2">we give it a random program so we give</p>

<p begin="01:44:12.960" end="01:44:16.639" style="s2">and we look to see what happens and</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.960" end="01:44:19.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a beautiful aspect</p>

<p begin="01:45:01.199" end="01:45:06.159" style="s2">yeah so that the quantum randomness or</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.159" end="01:45:08.719" style="s2">pseudo-randomness or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.159" end="01:45:10.159" style="s2">was the mechanism by which complexity</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.719" end="01:45:13.199" style="s2">was bootstrapped from</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.159" end="01:45:15.920" style="s2">a relatively uniform early universe</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.199" end="01:45:17.760" style="s2">is that it in a nutshell exactly i mean</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.920" end="01:45:19.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s lots of very cool stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.760" end="01:45:20.639" style="s2">this it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it has to do</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.119" end="01:45:21.760" style="s2">with gravity and actually quantum</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.639" end="01:45:23.440" style="s2">gravity it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.760" end="01:45:25.280" style="s2">oh you know the universe was very</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.440" end="01:45:27.040" style="s2">uniform to begin with and at a state of</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.280" end="01:45:29.440" style="s2">maximum entropy how did it get</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.040" end="01:45:30.080" style="s2">so non-uniform turns out when you have</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.440" end="01:45:33.199" style="s2">gravity</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.080" end="01:45:33.600" style="s2">that uniformity is bad clumpiness is</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.199" end="01:45:35.600" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.600" end="01:45:37.520" style="s2">matter likes to clump together to form</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.600" end="01:45:38.800" style="s2">things like you know stars and planets</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.520" end="01:45:40.560" style="s2">and galaxies</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.800" end="01:45:42.000" style="s2">and then once things start to clump it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.560" end="01:45:43.199" style="s2">like oh</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.000" end="01:45:45.520" style="s2">you know actually then this</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.199" end="01:45:46.960" style="s2">spontaneously generates the information</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.520" end="01:45:49.440" style="s2">theoretic conditions that allow</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.960" end="01:45:51.600" style="s2">computation to bootstrap itself into</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.440" end="01:45:53.760" style="s2">more ever more complicated forms by</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.600" end="01:45:55.600" style="s2">generating ever more complicated forms</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.760" end="01:45:56.960" style="s2">and patterns in energy so called free</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.600" end="01:45:59.760" style="s2">energy so you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.960" end="01:46:00.239" style="s2">first you get planets stars galaxies you</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.760" end="01:46:02.639" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.239" end="01:46:04.480" style="s2">then you get you know on planets you get</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.639" end="01:46:07.040" style="s2">more and more complicated chemical</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.480" end="01:46:07.600" style="s2">compounds that can recombine in ever</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.040" end="01:46:09.840" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.600" end="01:46:11.440" style="s2">complicated chemical fashions to perform</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.840" end="01:46:12.159" style="s2">more and more complicated chemicals that</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.440" end="01:46:14.000" style="s2">oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.159" end="01:46:15.840" style="s2">then a certain point it&#39;s like oh this</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.000" end="01:46:16.639" style="s2">group of chemicals could be rna or</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.840" end="01:46:18.400" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.639" end="01:46:20.719" style="s2">they figured out a way to reproduce</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.400" end="01:46:22.159" style="s2">their state but with variation</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.719" end="01:46:23.840" style="s2">once you have things that reproduce with</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.159" end="01:46:26.960" style="s2">variation then that&#39;s just life</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.840" end="01:46:28.560" style="s2">man you know and and then life is off</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.960" end="01:46:30.639" style="s2">and running and so there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.560" end="01:46:31.520" style="s2">natural tendency at each stage along the</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.639" end="01:46:33.920" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.520" end="01:46:36.639" style="s2">for the information processing power of</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.920" end="01:46:39.199" style="s2">the previous generation if you like</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.639" end="01:46:40.880" style="s2">to get bootstrapped into an ever more</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.199" end="01:46:43.119" style="s2">complicated form of information</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.880" end="01:46:45.199" style="s2">processing in the next generation</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.119" end="01:46:47.360" style="s2">though it is difficult to maintain that</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.199" end="01:46:48.159" style="s2">right the famous error catastrophe and</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.360" end="01:46:50.480" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.159" end="01:46:51.760" style="s2">right it&#39;s not easy to maintain that</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.480" end="01:46:53.840" style="s2">complexity from</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.760" end="01:46:55.840" style="s2">generation to generation that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.840" end="01:46:57.520" style="s2">so interesting about life</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.840" end="01:47:00.239" style="s2">i had an amazing conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.520" end="01:47:02.639" style="s2">stuart kaufman once out of sfi for about</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.239" end="01:47:04.400" style="s2">four hours and we both ended up at the</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.639" end="01:47:07.840" style="s2">same point which was how the</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.400" end="01:47:09.679" style="s2"> did pre-organic life</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.840" end="01:47:11.600" style="s2">managed to get over the error</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.679" end="01:47:14.320" style="s2">catastrophe because the rna world</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.600" end="01:47:15.760" style="s2">alone the error rate is too high but</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.320" end="01:47:17.920" style="s2">when you get to the dna plus all the</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.760" end="01:47:19.199" style="s2">replication machinery the error rate is</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.920" end="01:47:20.159" style="s2">low enough to defeat the error</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.199" end="01:47:22.080" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.159" end="01:47:24.239" style="s2">how the hell did we get over that bridge</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.080" end="01:47:27.119" style="s2">without the air correction</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.239" end="01:47:28.159" style="s2">and we both said if we know that it</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.119" end="01:47:29.920" style="s2">may actually have something to do with</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.159" end="01:47:32.639" style="s2">the fermi paradox just maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.920" end="01:47:36.000" style="s2">goddamn art maybe it only happened once</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.639" end="01:47:38.239" style="s2">but anyway i would put that caveat</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.000" end="01:47:39.520" style="s2">on your story which is yes quantum</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.239" end="01:47:41.760" style="s2">randomness creates</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.520" end="01:47:44.400" style="s2">complexity but often the complexity</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.760" end="01:47:46.239" style="s2">breaks down again very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.400" end="01:47:48.840" style="s2">absolutely and in fact the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.239" end="01:47:51.760" style="s2">features that exactly be the same</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.840" end="01:47:53.920" style="s2">instability that makes you know matter</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.760" end="01:47:55.360" style="s2">and energy clump together to form stars</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.920" end="01:47:57.760" style="s2">and galaxies and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.360" end="01:47:58.639" style="s2">you need instability in order to go from</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.760" end="01:48:00.639" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.639" end="01:48:03.119" style="s2">homogeneous and uniform to something</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.639" end="01:48:05.119" style="s2">that&#39;s non-homogeneous and non-uniform</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.119" end="01:48:07.600" style="s2">the same you know instability that says</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.119" end="01:48:09.679" style="s2">oh simple groups of chemicals together</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.600" end="01:48:11.679" style="s2">are not unstable to the formation of</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.679" end="01:48:13.520" style="s2">more complex groups of chemicals</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.679" end="01:48:15.199" style="s2">and then oh just complex groups of</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.520" end="01:48:17.360" style="s2">chemicals are unstable to</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.199" end="01:48:19.119" style="s2">the set of auto catalytic sets and say</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.360" end="01:48:19.760" style="s2">something like the rna world if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.119" end="01:48:21.920" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.760" end="01:48:23.280" style="s2">the world came together but then the rna</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.920" end="01:48:25.199" style="s2">world is unstable</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.280" end="01:48:27.119" style="s2">to things that have dna and error</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.199" end="01:48:29.040" style="s2">correction that can be more meticulous</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.119" end="01:48:31.040" style="s2">and create even more complex forms</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.040" end="01:48:32.639" style="s2">so i don&#39;t claim to understand this but</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.040" end="01:48:34.480" style="s2">you know something like that definitely</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.639" end="01:48:35.760" style="s2">happened</p>
