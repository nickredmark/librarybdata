<p begin="00:20:18.260" end="00:20:22.860" style="s2">yeah the way we think of sleep is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:25.020" style="s2">we need our eight hours of sleep in</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.700" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">just come to him from meditating this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.340" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;m honored it&#39;s it&#39;s unusual</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.710" end="00:22:03.169" style="s2">now for us to think of for example the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">priest caste which you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.169" end="00:22:12.309" style="s2">they do is they think or they meditate</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:16.600" style="s2">or they pray and in so doing they Co</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.309" end="00:22:19.370" style="s2">they they they Cohen enlighten the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.600" end="00:22:22.760" style="s2">but and it&#39;s a completely non productive</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.370" end="00:22:24.860" style="s2">it&#39;s completely non utilitarian it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.760" end="00:22:28.279" style="s2">be measured it can&#39;t be called it it can</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.279" end="00:22:34.130" style="s2">and yes so the way one can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.090" end="00:22:36.529" style="s2">think about sleep is not that it makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.130" end="00:22:38.690" style="s2">you in any sense it&#39;s there to make you</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.529" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">more productive for anything but it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.690" end="00:22:43.490" style="s2">that in sleep something fun foundational</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:46.010" style="s2">happens which is that it brings you in</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.490" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">tune with being speaking this high</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.010" end="00:22:51.230" style="s2">daguerreian way or with the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:53.419" style="s2">way that that being awake doesn&#39;t so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.230" end="00:22:54.919" style="s2">have to take it seriously and on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.419" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">level to but that there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.919" end="00:22:59.649" style="s2">dreams tell us about us and about the</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.600" end="00:23:05.429" style="s2">yeah and so another thing I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.690" end="00:23:10.679" style="s2">wondering about is there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.429" end="00:23:14.100" style="s2">that we will get to idleness through</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.679" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">automation through through these like</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.100" end="00:23:17.309" style="s2">structures I mean this is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.690" end="00:23:20.700" style="s2">idea going around of like fully</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.309" end="00:23:22.710" style="s2">automated luxury capitalism as you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.700" end="00:23:26.130" style="s2">the patch of the future that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.710" end="00:23:27.690" style="s2">release us from this idea of of work and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.130" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">this will to will</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.690" end="00:23:31.470" style="s2">how do you see that fitting into this</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:34.110" style="s2">idea of idleness do you find that to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.470" end="00:23:36.990" style="s2">a false false idea or do you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.110" end="00:23:39.990" style="s2">that&#39;s actually our true path this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.990" end="00:23:42.090" style="s2">this is what Bertrand Russell argues for</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.990" end="00:23:44.309" style="s2">in his essay in praise of idleness this</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.090" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">is exactly this is 100 years old now and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.309" end="00:23:49.769" style="s2">he says did all we point Stu everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:51.720" style="s2">so this is a hundred years ago and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.769" end="00:23:53.519" style="s2">says ok everything that&#39;s wrong is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.720" end="00:23:56.779" style="s2">following it everything&#39;s mass</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.519" end="00:23:59.879" style="s2">entertainment nothing is done for itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.779" end="00:24:01.470" style="s2">- you know no one&#39;s writing a book she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.879" end="00:24:03.139" style="s2">writing a book because people are no</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.470" end="00:24:06.059" style="s2">one&#39;s studying for the sake of studying</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.139" end="00:24:07.289" style="s2">there&#39;s no art for the sake of oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.059" end="00:24:08.730" style="s2">got it so he points to everything that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.289" end="00:24:10.529" style="s2">we&#39;re still talking about now and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.730" end="00:24:12.299" style="s2">he says but the great solution will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.529" end="00:24:15.149" style="s2">and there&#39;s you know a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.299" end="00:24:18.210" style="s2">salvation once we have full technique he</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.149" end="00:24:20.909" style="s2">says in the older English way there we</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.210" end="00:24:23.190" style="s2">will have basically what people now call</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.909" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">fully automated luxury communism which</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.190" end="00:24:28.830" style="s2">which then by the way is taken up by</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.250" end="00:24:34.889" style="s2">obviously Silicon Valley&#39;s but basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.529" end="00:24:37.669" style="s2">just a weird amalgamation of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.889" end="00:24:41.070" style="s2">Frankfurt School Marcos a and Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.669" end="00:24:44.330" style="s2">that&#39;s their philosophy but but what</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.070" end="00:24:47.429" style="s2">this reveals what Russell reveals is</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.330" end="00:24:50.220" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly this right we have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.429" end="00:24:54.330" style="s2">met all needs and there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.220" end="00:24:55.049" style="s2">essay by by Keynes who was in the same</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.049" end="00:25:00.750" style="s2">Cambridge boys as Russell where he says</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.470" end="00:25:04.200" style="s2">around the same time we will now have to</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.200" end="00:25:10.440" style="s2">so that our offspring in a in 2020</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.440" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">live off for the rest of eternity</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.700" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the same idea these IP these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:20.170" style="s2">are these notions are very old this</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">notion this is why I point out very</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.170" end="00:25:27.340" style="s2">briefly and much longer in some other</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:29.320" style="s2">essays that Plato points out the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.340" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">difference between Atlantis and Athens</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:36.490" style="s2">Atlantis sinks because they&#39;ve focus</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:39.310" style="s2">they begin to focus on lack on full</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.310" end="00:25:42.150" style="s2">saying that human beings don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:51.610" style="s2">we need sex all kinds of needs met yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.520" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">but these are immediate needs and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.610" end="00:25:55.810" style="s2">trouble is with our systems so called</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:58.540" style="s2">the bf is all we focus on are these</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.810" end="00:26:00.700" style="s2">immediate needs within which the human</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.540" end="00:26:02.490" style="s2">being is ever only reduced to as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.700" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">know you know we&#39;re we&#39;re voters and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.490" end="00:26:07.780" style="s2">consumers that&#39;s who we are but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.530" end="00:26:11.110" style="s2">not allowed but but and language is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.780" end="00:26:12.490" style="s2">communication etc but for for someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.110" end="00:26:14.230" style="s2">like Hegel it would still be to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.490" end="00:26:16.120" style="s2">Nietzsche especially that the human</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.230" end="00:26:19.150" style="s2">being is an artist first that language</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.120" end="00:26:21.640" style="s2">is poetry first so the the it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.150" end="00:26:23.890" style="s2">we can reach idleness isn&#39;t or leisure</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.640" end="00:26:25.990" style="s2">that&#39;s in this true sense of Scola is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.890" end="00:26:28.750" style="s2">not something you can reach once</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.990" end="00:26:32.380" style="s2">everything has been met but no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.750" end="00:26:34.420" style="s2">actually you you arrive at it and as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.380" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">arrive at this way of thinking which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.420" end="00:26:40.150" style="s2">the classical way of being which means</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:43.770" style="s2">that life is plenty be being is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.150" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">excess of itself it gifts itself and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.770" end="00:26:49.510" style="s2">then by by having this is where meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:51.070" style="s2">arises that&#39;s when we already know</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.510" end="00:26:52.780" style="s2">meaning Christ is the true meaning arise</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.070" end="00:26:56.100" style="s2">from out of this way of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.780" end="00:26:58.570" style="s2">then everything else flows from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.100" end="00:27:00.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s thinking first we</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.570" end="00:27:03.190" style="s2">remember on the earth to speak with</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.280" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">Hegel not not just to do an act we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:08.920" style="s2">the earth to grasp and understand and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:13.060" style="s2">reason and that&#39;s what we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.920" end="00:27:15.700" style="s2">first and then that&#39;s what then a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.060" end="00:27:17.620" style="s2">certain fullness comes from but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.700" end="00:27:20.710" style="s2">if it&#39;s about trying to reach a state</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.620" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">where everything&#39;s mats I mean show me</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.710" end="00:27:25.720" style="s2">show me the possibility of that because</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:27.730" style="s2">when you start putting up conditions</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.720" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">off you know we need this condition in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.730" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">place in this condition place then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:34.210" style="s2">get the most unless any way of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:38.100" style="s2">because actually what you have is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.210" end="00:27:38.100" style="s2">tyranny of conditions and have to be met</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.060" end="00:27:45.910" style="s2">yeah yeah I just I can&#39;t help shape</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.300" end="00:27:48.580" style="s2">shake the fact that this this forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.910" end="00:27:51.990" style="s2">seems to be pervasive on so many levels</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.580" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">that I&#39;m just curious as to how are you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.990" end="00:27:57.940" style="s2">approaching this forgetting and trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:28:00.299" style="s2">to bring more people into this this way</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.940" end="00:28:03.299" style="s2">of being</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.299" end="00:28:07.289" style="s2">in your own like practices or with with</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.299" end="00:28:09.089" style="s2">your thinkers going yeah it&#39;s very some</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.289" end="00:28:10.739" style="s2">level it&#39;s very simple right</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.089" end="00:28:14.909" style="s2">it&#39;s because the question is a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.739" end="00:28:16.739" style="s2">simple question so it now says if my</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.909" end="00:28:20.729" style="s2">internet connection is unstable as if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.739" end="00:28:26.539" style="s2">just let me know if it breaks down if</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.729" end="00:28:29.219" style="s2">that even works in the I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.539" end="00:28:31.669" style="s2">whether what I&#39;m what I&#39;m doing or</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.219" end="00:28:35.549" style="s2">saying it you know has any bearing but</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.669" end="00:28:38.070" style="s2">what I can say perhaps in general is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.549" end="00:28:41.070" style="s2">that what Heidi has says when he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.070" end="00:28:44.190" style="s2">of the Oblivion of being he you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.070" end="00:28:49.289" style="s2">translate this as saying forgetting the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.190" end="00:28:50.419" style="s2">old ways and and it&#39;s a quite a simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.289" end="00:28:53.190" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.419" end="00:28:55.320" style="s2">Totti na and I that which was being</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.190" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">being is just a different name for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:01.829" style="s2">old and to make this even more like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:04.409" style="s2">slogan and as you know what our but we</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.829" end="00:29:05.639" style="s2">are always after is the new hope this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.409" end="00:29:08.759" style="s2">all it the new formula of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.639" end="00:29:10.259" style="s2">dishwashing tablets and and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.759" end="00:29:11.759" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s supposed to give us</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.259" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">meaning the new the bats are the higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.759" end="00:29:14.909" style="s2">the more superlative the bigger the</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.909" end="00:29:23.309" style="s2">and but it can&#39;t be met right when you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.459" end="00:29:25.469" style="s2">begin to diagnose that what&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.309" end="00:29:28.139" style="s2">lurking behind this is the fear not to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.469" end="00:29:30.209" style="s2">to be completely competing with this</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.139" end="00:29:31.889" style="s2">right like this is why I don&#39;t like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.209" end="00:29:35.009" style="s2">notion of for example the marketplace of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.889" end="00:29:38.269" style="s2">ideas you know ideas don&#39;t compete right</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.009" end="00:29:41.369" style="s2">there&#39;s no competition in in thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.269" end="00:29:45.570" style="s2">because truth is unitary and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.369" end="00:29:48.599" style="s2">participate in it so the way that this I</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.599" end="00:29:53.099" style="s2">current situation is to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.489" end="00:29:57.899" style="s2">in opening right and then you can point</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.099" end="00:29:59.459" style="s2">to certain one of the response that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.899" end="00:30:01.589" style="s2">saw but it&#39;s time to build with this</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.420" end="00:30:57.080" style="s2">ask it seems more and more the question</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.300" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">of meaning and that&#39;s where you can see</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.080" end="00:31:01.970" style="s2">an opening but then of course philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.820" end="00:31:05.570" style="s2">as the that&#39;s the the trouble is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.970" end="00:31:07.280" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a single answer but what</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.570" end="00:31:10.490" style="s2">this is and even just the quest for</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.280" end="00:31:13.910" style="s2">meaning is already a beginning off off</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.490" end="00:31:18.980" style="s2">remembering and and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.760" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">philosophical practice so I talk to</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.650" end="00:31:58.070" style="s2">this is and if you look at this then on</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.930" end="00:32:07.970" style="s2">why this forgetting sets in and then of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.990" end="00:32:10.070" style="s2">course it accelerates further etc but</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.970" end="00:32:13.750" style="s2">right now even the Queen of England has</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.750" end="00:32:18.470" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s and it&#39;s very fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.160" end="00:32:21.020" style="s2">to see all of the sudden political</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.470" end="00:32:22.540" style="s2">leaders like the Queen or today even a</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:35.090" style="s2">and that&#39;s who are in know who are with</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.720" end="00:32:42.790" style="s2">as as it can be as simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.230" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t even as it doesn&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.520" end="00:32:48.660" style="s2">into the the most you know pressing</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:52.860" style="s2">philosophical questions but he can just</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.660" end="00:32:55.920" style="s2">be how can I say I what is it that lets</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.860" end="00:32:57.870" style="s2">me say that I am and that&#39;s when this</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:32:59.910" style="s2">philosophical thinking perhaps them said</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.870" end="00:33:03.270" style="s2">somebody need the stands of leisure</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.910" end="00:33:05.040" style="s2">first yeah</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.010" end="00:33:33.000" style="s2">one of my questions is just around what</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.860" end="00:33:37.460" style="s2">can we learn from Eastern cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.000" end="00:33:39.900" style="s2">the sense of the spirit of non doing I</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.460" end="00:33:44.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent the last two years in Asia</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.900" end="00:33:46.770" style="s2">and I found it easier to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.310" end="00:33:50.070" style="s2">experiment with different modes of being</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.770" end="00:33:54.360" style="s2">there in a way that I can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.070" end="00:33:56.010" style="s2">explain but it just is and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.360" end="00:33:59.570" style="s2">if you&#39;ve experienced anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.010" end="00:34:04.560" style="s2">what kind of wisdom you think we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.570" end="00:34:07.080" style="s2">extract from those cultures and just any</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.560" end="00:34:10.410" style="s2">thoughts on them yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.080" end="00:34:12.390" style="s2">I will so I will publish it and good to</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.570" end="00:34:36.690" style="s2">not lived in Asia so I can&#39;t have don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.860" style="s2">have any personal experiences but what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.690" end="00:34:40.700" style="s2">see for example with someone like</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.860" end="00:34:42.929" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.700" end="00:34:45.500" style="s2">philosophy like Heidegger who is trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.929" end="00:34:49.410" style="s2">to 20th century is essentially where</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.500" end="00:34:52.380" style="s2">these worlds inevitably began to meet</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.410" end="00:34:54.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s still occurring and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.380" end="00:34:55.740" style="s2">so we have to be I think one has to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.060" end="00:34:57.180" style="s2">strict to some degree that we are you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.740" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">know there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.180" end="00:35:03.390" style="s2">there is a difference and it&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">appreciating that difference though that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.390" end="00:35:08.039" style="s2">a genuine dialogue can set in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I think that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.039" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">sort of them that&#39;s important to bear in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.440" end="00:35:20.970" style="s2">mind and what though what you can I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:23.329" style="s2">think what one can see in terms of they</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.970" end="00:35:28.019" style="s2">have this radical fundamental difference</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.329" end="00:35:30.990" style="s2">is that what we call the science is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.019" end="00:35:32.819" style="s2">hard sciences that&#39;s that&#39;s Western that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.990" end="00:35:34.799" style="s2">European that&#39;s Western and it wants</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.819" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">what it wants is something else entirely</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.799" end="00:35:41.329" style="s2">that when you could see with Taoism or</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:44.450" style="s2">Buddhism which is it once control</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.329" end="00:35:47.970" style="s2">Buddhism does not want control over</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.450" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">beings in their in their totality and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.970" end="00:35:57.390" style="s2">that&#39;s something that has begun to set</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:59.130" style="s2">in in early modern times with in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.390" end="00:36:01.259" style="s2">Europe with with Francis Bacon and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.130" end="00:36:03.239" style="s2">reigning de Kaap for example that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.259" end="00:36:06.809" style="s2">that&#39;s basically way you can say where</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.239" end="00:36:09.299" style="s2">this begins and where we also though</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.809" end="00:36:10.710" style="s2">well then we could perhaps say it&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.299" end="00:36:13.589" style="s2">to say this is also where we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.710" end="00:36:17.249" style="s2">forget but what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.589" end="00:36:20.009" style="s2">because we we become a thinking thing or</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.249" end="00:36:22.920" style="s2">as a take counts as we become pure</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.009" end="00:36:26.190" style="s2">machines as Thomas Hobbes says or just</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.920" end="00:36:28.799" style="s2">machines and we&#39;re also becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.190" end="00:36:30.930" style="s2">and more divided from from nature and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.799" end="00:36:32.579" style="s2">from from the earth but don&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.930" end="00:36:35.009" style="s2">that for Descartes animals have</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.579" end="00:36:37.739" style="s2">basically machines and that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.009" end="00:36:40.799" style="s2">at the heart of of our being now is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.739" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">animals are machines plans are even you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.799" end="00:36:46.470" style="s2">know even less than machines for Hobbes</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:50.249" style="s2">all we are is the state is a machine</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.470" end="00:36:54.559" style="s2">even everything is machinery and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.249" end="00:36:57.470" style="s2">one can learn I think and learning in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.559" end="00:37:00.539" style="s2">learning means not knowing at first and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.470" end="00:37:02.970" style="s2">also means a certain distance so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.539" end="00:37:04.529" style="s2">from the distance between this way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.970" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">being and the other ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.529" end="00:37:10.170" style="s2">that&#39;s where maybe this sensation</p>

<p begin="00:39:15.470" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">think we have to understand the</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.240" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">interesting I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.330" end="00:39:38.070" style="s2">interesting to hear what you what your</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:40.230" style="s2">perspective is and with what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.070" end="00:39:42.450" style="s2">noticing and I guess maybe I have an eye</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.230" end="00:39:43.740" style="s2">for Heidegger but it seems like more</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.450" end="00:39:48.089" style="s2">people are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.740" end="00:39:49.859" style="s2">Heidegger right now and kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.089" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">back to his fundamental questions about</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.859" end="00:39:59.550" style="s2">being dwelling thinking and yeah death</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:01.500" style="s2">death and what do you think about I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.550" end="00:40:03.450" style="s2">Heidegger coming up in conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.500" end="00:40:09.510" style="s2">what Heidegger has to give in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.450" end="00:40:12.440" style="s2">present moment I well what what his</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.510" end="00:40:18.109" style="s2">thinking has to give this what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.440" end="00:40:18.109" style="s2">always had to give which is remembering</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.349" end="00:40:25.290" style="s2">remembering the the fundamental question</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.830" end="00:40:26.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I think now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.290" end="00:40:29.369" style="s2">weird right now it&#39;s less a stroke I</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">said in a conversation with guys angst</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.369" end="00:40:33.900" style="s2">or a couple weeks ago or a month ago now</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:36.230" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s uncanny then philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.900" end="00:40:41.460" style="s2">all of a sudden is no longer untimely</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.230" end="00:40:43.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;ve now entered as a sphere</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.460" end="00:40:46.170" style="s2">where for every it&#39;ll probably be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.800" end="00:40:48.690" style="s2">brief moment right there I&#39;m where</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.170" end="00:40:52.589" style="s2">people actually listen and are open to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.690" end="00:40:54.780" style="s2">an in breathing off of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.589" end="00:40:56.369" style="s2">because but also because as I said in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.780" end="00:40:59.130" style="s2">the talk with the the operations of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.369" end="00:41:02.430" style="s2">will to will have have stopped and in</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.130" end="00:41:03.990" style="s2">because it I think what the fuel of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.430" end="00:41:05.940" style="s2">is and I&#39;ve said this in other talks the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.990" end="00:41:09.210" style="s2">fuel of it is boredom which then needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.940" end="00:41:11.580" style="s2">to be entertained distracted from and of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.210" end="00:41:13.230" style="s2">course also meaninglessness if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.580" end="00:41:15.390" style="s2">you if your life is meaningless you</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.230" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">consume you fill the this is what people</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.390" end="00:41:21.240" style="s2">describe who have addictions to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:25.349" style="s2">consumption is that they are filling a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.240" end="00:41:28.320" style="s2">void a lack what Heidegger is telling us</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.349" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">is you know what he saw is that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.320" end="00:41:34.299" style="s2">make ourselves is that we are not in</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:36.459" style="s2">charge</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.299" end="00:41:38.229" style="s2">subjectivity fools itself on the human</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.459" end="00:41:41.949" style="s2">subject fools itself to assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.229" end="00:41:44.199" style="s2">were fully in control and controlling</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.949" end="00:41:46.179" style="s2">the world with Heidegger says no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.199" end="00:41:49.239" style="s2">not we&#39;re actually we&#39;re functionaries</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.179" end="00:41:51.099" style="s2">of technics he says and his entire</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.239" end="00:41:55.479" style="s2">philosophy and that&#39;s what my book is</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.099" end="00:41:57.009" style="s2">about an idea is a memento mori remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.479" end="00:42:00.069" style="s2">that you are mortal remember that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.009" end="00:42:02.589" style="s2">are a finite being that is not in charge</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.069" end="00:42:06.579" style="s2">but at the same time playing with forces</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.589" end="00:42:11.079" style="s2">and powers this being has never summoned</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.579" end="00:42:12.699" style="s2">before and this is why perhaps hiding is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.079" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">now coming back up but what are your</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.699" end="00:42:18.699" style="s2">thoughts Raven what do you think that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:22.380" style="s2">well I mean the kind of uncanny thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.699" end="00:42:26.439" style="s2">about this this event is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.380" end="00:42:29.859" style="s2">confined to our homes at which brings us</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.439" end="00:42:32.079" style="s2">into dwelling and dwelling brings us</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.859" end="00:42:34.599" style="s2">into has I mean it opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.079" end="00:42:38.140" style="s2">possibility of bringing us into into</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.599" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">being and into maybe even the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.140" end="00:42:47.019" style="s2">contemplation of mortality and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:51.459" style="s2">kind of massive coordination of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.019" end="00:42:54.650" style="s2">whole human population that provides us</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.459" end="00:42:57.350" style="s2">opening for</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.650" end="00:43:00.340" style="s2">a new way or I mean an old way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.350" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">rediscovering or remembering of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.340" end="00:43:06.050" style="s2">this other way of being which is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:08.780" style="s2">human and an escape I think from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.050" end="00:43:12.500" style="s2">machine ik metaphor of existence which</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.780" end="00:43:15.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve just been doing and just operating</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.500" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">within and now we are coming back into</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.560" end="00:43:24.050" style="s2">relationship with the the earth that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:30.110" style="s2">kind of biological and I find that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.050" end="00:43:32.870" style="s2">Heidegger was just right on in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.110" end="00:43:34.790" style="s2">really providing and I wonder about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.870" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">German language as well because so much</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.790" end="00:43:40.550" style="s2">of your work I find is acting as Trent</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:44.180" style="s2">as translator for English speakers</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.550" end="00:43:46.610" style="s2">because the German words I have so many</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.180" end="00:43:49.160" style="s2">dimensions to them that in English</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.610" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">become flattened and so much of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.160" end="00:43:58.520" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s thinking seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">dimensional oriented in landscape so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.520" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">yeah here&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:06.440" style="s2">English and German between the two</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">vernacular the German language is</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.440" end="00:44:14.150" style="s2">spatial temporal and verbal so this</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:16.130" style="s2">means that we very easily smash together</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.150" end="00:44:18.320" style="s2">words yes but we also very easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.130" end="00:44:21.080" style="s2">to this joke of haha very long German</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.320" end="00:44:22.490" style="s2">words maybe further but also we can has</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.080" end="00:44:26.600" style="s2">take the word</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.490" end="00:44:29.810" style="s2">stellen which means to place or to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.600" end="00:44:31.910" style="s2">position now I can say here shelling and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.810" end="00:44:34.460" style="s2">that means to produce and then I can say</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.910" end="00:44:36.590" style="s2">for shelling and that means to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.460" end="00:44:40.040" style="s2">to represent but also to introduce and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.590" end="00:44:42.050" style="s2">all I do is add a prefix to it and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.040" end="00:44:44.420" style="s2">becomes spatial temporal because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.050" end="00:44:45.890" style="s2">prefix indicates a certain direction and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.420" end="00:44:48.260" style="s2">the direction is always spatial temporal</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.890" end="00:44:49.880" style="s2">the English language is different the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.260" end="00:44:53.390" style="s2">English language finds it very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.880" end="00:44:54.980" style="s2">to turn a verb into a noun and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.390" end="00:44:57.500" style="s2">English language is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.980" end="00:45:00.080" style="s2">descriptive this is why it also just in</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.500" end="00:45:02.750" style="s2">pure quantity a quantitative terms the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.080" end="00:45:05.990" style="s2">English language has more words it just</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.750" end="00:45:08.059" style="s2">has a lot more words to describe things</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.990" end="00:45:10.099" style="s2">objects and you can just</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.059" end="00:45:13.670" style="s2">say a lot of you know beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.099" end="00:45:14.839" style="s2">adjectives about something the German</p>

<p begin="00:46:01.819" end="00:46:05.029" style="s2">same time and this also comes back to a</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.609" end="00:46:18.349" style="s2">the dialogue with Buddhism for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.249" end="00:46:20.299" style="s2">because Buddhism is a thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.349" end="00:46:22.969" style="s2">withdrawing is a thinking of not</p>

<p begin="00:46:22.969" end="00:46:26.949" style="s2">we need to get to in the West is to</p>

<p begin="00:46:29.479" end="00:46:35.719" style="s2">because we want this total availability</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.059" end="00:46:38.599" style="s2">and access and you know control over it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.719" end="00:46:41.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s disappeared all</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.599" end="00:46:43.549" style="s2">right and now we&#39;re in this abeyance but</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.719" end="00:46:45.199" style="s2">we don&#39;t get know what&#39;s what&#39;s going to</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.709" end="00:47:00.469" style="s2">to Germany so yeah old all the planning</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.189" end="00:47:05.660" style="s2">is out the window it&#39;s it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.469" end="00:47:07.640" style="s2">day-to-day now and yeah yeah sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.660" end="00:47:11.179" style="s2">future has like fundamentally changed</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.640" end="00:47:14.140" style="s2">yes yes Andrew would you like to meet</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.179" end="00:47:14.140" style="s2">yourself and ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.120" end="00:47:22.190" style="s2">hi Joanna&#39;s great presentation I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.690" end="00:47:24.560" style="s2">following some of your content on</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.190" end="00:47:27.860" style="s2">YouTube which is which is great as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.560" end="00:47:29.900" style="s2">so I just wanted to ask do you think</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.860" end="00:47:32.420" style="s2">this idea of being conflicts with our</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.900" end="00:47:35.720" style="s2">evolutionary drive for status in our</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.420" end="00:47:38.540" style="s2">driver to move up the social hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.720" end="00:47:41.330" style="s2">because I think at our core you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.540" end="00:47:44.060" style="s2">humans are status seeking animals and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.330" end="00:47:46.250" style="s2">see this potential conflict between our</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.060" end="00:47:52.250" style="s2">sort of evolutionary drives and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.250" end="00:47:53.930" style="s2">idea to you know adopt a an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.250" end="00:47:57.860" style="s2">being or being in the present moment or</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.930" end="00:48:06.140" style="s2">or what not okay what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.860" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">being I guess perhaps Heidegger&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.140" end="00:48:17.030" style="s2">of being yeah we just want I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:18.920" style="s2">personally I haven&#39;t read Heidegger but</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.030" end="00:48:20.660" style="s2">I guess sort of what you were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.920" end="00:48:24.290" style="s2">get at it what we were getting at in</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.660" end="00:48:27.410" style="s2">that lecture like let&#39;s say I think he</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.290" end="00:48:31.460" style="s2">uses the word dasya design</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.410" end="00:48:33.559" style="s2">yeah yeah design is the being of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.460" end="00:48:36.049" style="s2">human being and that&#39;s a regular German</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.559" end="00:48:37.880" style="s2">word it&#39;s the openness to the ver of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.049" end="00:48:39.950" style="s2">being but you see when you ask the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.880" end="00:48:42.140" style="s2">question what you&#39;re what the question</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.950" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">does is it posits that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.140" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">evolutionary drive for status that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:48.170" style="s2">questioned but that&#39;s so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:49.579" style="s2">have what one has to do in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.170" end="00:48:52.190" style="s2">philosophical question is first to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.579" end="00:48:54.259" style="s2">question the question why is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.190" end="00:48:57.500" style="s2">true fundamentally true that all we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.259" end="00:48:59.299" style="s2">is social hierarchy or status is is this</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.500" end="00:49:01.059" style="s2">all the human beings do is this true for</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.299" end="00:49:04.250" style="s2">all human beings across all</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.059" end="00:49:06.289" style="s2">civilizations is this true for what we</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.250" end="00:49:09.079" style="s2">what we have original societies is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.289" end="00:49:12.759" style="s2">the case is is that the chorus is only</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.079" end="00:49:18.279" style="s2">the case for perhaps competitive</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.759" end="00:49:22.299" style="s2">capitalist societies in which that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.279" end="00:49:25.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that kind of status seeking is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.299" end="00:49:28.430" style="s2">rewarded and is this perhaps not the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.880" end="00:49:31.579" style="s2">case for even for a country up until</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.430" end="00:49:33.559" style="s2">this day like Italy where or or Spain or</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.579" end="00:49:35.569" style="s2">Japan but people don&#39;t thinks in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.559" end="00:49:37.579" style="s2">don&#39;t think in terms of jobs but in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.569" end="00:49:40.339" style="s2">terms of roles that they take in their</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.579" end="00:49:44.089" style="s2">community right I have a certain role to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.339" end="00:49:45.710" style="s2">fulfill and and then the question of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.089" end="00:49:48.259" style="s2">being has to do with the question of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.710" end="00:49:51.859" style="s2">meaning that&#39;s what it ultimately is and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.259" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t so you can you could have even</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.859" end="00:50:00.670" style="s2">within you know this this framework the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:50:03.710" style="s2">drive for status which human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.670" end="00:50:04.609" style="s2">to some degree but not only I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.710" end="00:50:09.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.609" end="00:50:12.829" style="s2">driving history even that can be just</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.890" end="00:50:14.900" style="s2">can reveal something about meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.829" end="00:50:18.200" style="s2">what it means to be human but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.900" end="00:50:22.039" style="s2">the only dimension we&#39;re in right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.200" end="00:50:23.690" style="s2">because there are more moments I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.039" end="00:50:25.730" style="s2">think that might not be recorded in</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.690" end="00:50:28.069" style="s2">history where human beings do something</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.730" end="00:50:29.960" style="s2">not at all to find status or social</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.069" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">hierarchy or caring for the elderly is</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.960" end="00:50:36.799" style="s2">not highly status rewarding and still</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:38.240" style="s2">people do it and and luckily because if</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.799" end="00:50:41.049" style="s2">not everything would break down and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.240" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">actually societies that don&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.049" end="00:50:48.429" style="s2">they break down all right this is North</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:51.369" style="s2">America in a nutshell is it&#39;s just you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.429" end="00:50:54.579" style="s2">know give me my my money in my career</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.369" end="00:50:56.229" style="s2">and I will not care for the elderly</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.579" end="00:51:03.989" style="s2">it&#39;s I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.229" end="00:51:03.989" style="s2">sustainable Society anyways thank you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.339" end="00:51:16.749" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m finally yo.hannes I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.619" end="00:51:21.640" style="s2">to ask you about how you&#39;re addressing</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.749" end="00:51:24.309" style="s2">the failure of our act or the capture of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.640" end="00:51:28.090" style="s2">our academic institutions or the places</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.309" end="00:51:31.289" style="s2">of where we&#39;re thinking ought to dwell</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.090" end="00:51:33.759" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.289" end="00:51:35.319" style="s2">Manchester is a case is you know oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.759" end="00:51:37.809" style="s2">we&#39;re losing trying to fifty million</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.319" end="00:51:40.539" style="s2">pounds this year so we&#39;re going to fire</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.809" end="00:51:42.519" style="s2">people that there was their response</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.539" end="00:51:44.679" style="s2">just today so yeah please go on sorry oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.519" end="00:51:46.719" style="s2">and I just saw in the chat that Andre</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.679" end="00:51:48.459" style="s2">has a question so we&#39;re gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.719" end="00:51:50.499" style="s2">let Andre ask that question here and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.459" end="00:51:58.359" style="s2">probably the final one so Andre please</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.499" end="00:52:03.519" style="s2">know you wanted to ask okay yeah can you</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.359" end="00:52:07.689" style="s2">hear me okay yes so this is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.519" end="00:52:11.289" style="s2">bit of a semantic question idleness</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.689" end="00:52:14.589" style="s2">I would probably define as a negation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.289" end="00:52:17.289" style="s2">something so to be idle is to not do</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.589" end="00:52:19.959" style="s2">something yeah and would there be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.289" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">delineation between having passive</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.959" end="00:52:28.239" style="s2">idleness and active idleness because</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:32.799" style="s2">would not one be just the lack of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.239" end="00:52:35.909" style="s2">being to in act on something passive</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.799" end="00:52:39.399" style="s2">idleness so it&#39;s your being is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.909" end="00:52:43.329" style="s2">acting on anything it&#39;s just being</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.399" end="00:52:47.699" style="s2">itself whereas in active violence you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.329" end="00:52:53.650" style="s2">using part of your define so to speak or</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.699" end="00:52:59.559" style="s2">one part of your being to actively</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.650" end="00:53:03.880" style="s2">not do something mm-hmm oh okay I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.559" end="00:53:05.559" style="s2">and answer this I think first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.880" end="00:53:09.150" style="s2">would think that&#39;s a fair description of</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.559" end="00:53:12.220" style="s2">it and of course idleness has these</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.150" end="00:53:16.089" style="s2">negative connotations in the English</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.690" end="00:55:31.799" style="s2">great example of trying to create</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.839" end="00:57:02.099" style="s2">important that&#39;s what academia needs</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.819" end="00:57:03.960" style="s2">that that&#39;s what an academia multum</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.099" end="00:57:05.940" style="s2">utley means philosophy and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.960" end="00:57:08.039" style="s2">what thinking needs right it can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.940" end="00:57:09.390" style="s2">be this the self-serving circles which</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.039" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">of course we have because we need</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">highly and in its functions</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:24.580" style="s2">but then of course you also have this</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.960" end="00:57:25.180" style="s2">this very sick slogan of publish or</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.580" end="00:57:28.270" style="s2">perish</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.180" end="00:57:32.320" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t publish you perish</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.270" end="00:57:33.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the opposite of the the idle</p>

<p begin="00:57:55.420" end="00:57:58.750" style="s2">perverted but it uses these let these</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.160" end="00:58:01.450" style="s2">words that are very meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.750" end="00:58:03.700" style="s2">profound and and wonderful but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.450" end="00:58:05.260" style="s2">perverts them the the peers and also</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.700" end="00:58:07.270" style="s2">everything is full of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.260" end="00:58:09.100" style="s2">everything is a burden right teaching is</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.270" end="00:58:10.870" style="s2">described by academics as a burden I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.100" end="00:58:12.940" style="s2">have to teach again and it&#39;s when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.870" end="00:58:14.290" style="s2">week nine here in the UK many was out</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.940" end="00:58:16.990" style="s2">week nine because it&#39;s just one more</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.290" end="00:58:19.030" style="s2">week of teaching and then finally my</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.990" end="00:58:21.340" style="s2">teaching load when it&#39;s teaching load</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.030" end="00:58:24.160" style="s2">it&#39;s all these words it&#39;s so ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.340" end="00:58:26.590" style="s2">the teaching is not a load right if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.160" end="00:58:28.780" style="s2">are a teacher then you read and then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.590" end="00:58:31.240" style="s2">write and then you teach and after</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.780" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">teaching so I got some you know not</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.240" end="00:58:37.380" style="s2">feedback I refuse now to use cybernetic</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:40.060" style="s2">language I&#39;ve gotten now responses and</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.380" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">more questions so I will go back</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.060" end="00:58:44.980" style="s2">afterwards and rewrite the essay and</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:47.740" style="s2">then I will publish it to get again</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.980" end="00:58:50.730" style="s2">responses to it and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.740" end="00:58:53.290" style="s2">that&#39;s the wholeness of of teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.730" end="00:58:55.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve never found it possible</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.290" end="00:58:57.550" style="s2">unfortunately within academic so also</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.930" end="00:58:59.650" style="s2">because they don&#39;t like accent excited</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.550" end="00:59:01.330" style="s2">eccentric types are now forbidden right</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.650" end="00:59:04.690" style="s2">so that&#39;s and that makes it difficult</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.330" end="00:59:06.730" style="s2">for me and when I try to publish my book</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.690" end="00:59:10.050" style="s2">on on Heidegger with finger which I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.730" end="00:59:13.500" style="s2">think they will now publish they made it</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.050" end="00:59:15.850" style="s2">the the reviewers who I&#39;ve never met one</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.500" end="00:59:20.410" style="s2">of them was okay and the other one was</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.850" end="00:59:22.630" style="s2">just violent the violence was you did he</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.410" end="00:59:24.370" style="s2">did not mention this author and not this</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.630" end="00:59:26.410" style="s2">author not this book and not this book</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.370" end="00:59:27.880" style="s2">that was the entire review of course I</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.410" end="00:59:29.350" style="s2">haven&#39;t mentioned everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.880" end="00:59:30.550" style="s2">everything that you think is you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.350" end="00:59:33.100" style="s2">where this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.550" end="00:59:35.410" style="s2">peer review and the violence comes in</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.100" end="00:59:42.910" style="s2">because it is anonymous in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.410" end="00:59:45.940" style="s2">anonymity is that that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.910" end="00:59:48.130" style="s2">actually where the entire idea of the</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:41.110" style="s2">history but as the tidings of be and</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.140" end="01:00:43.510" style="s2">right now we live through an ebbing away</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.110" end="01:00:45.580" style="s2">of being it begins to make more sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.510" end="01:00:49.270" style="s2">and you know you were a student on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.580" end="01:00:51.880" style="s2">Heidegger de leurs course and McCoy that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.270" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">artist from New York recently sent me a</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.640" end="01:01:00.190" style="s2">the concentration of positioning makes</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.730" end="01:01:02.230" style="s2">such a big difference because you begin</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.190" end="01:01:03.550" style="s2">to see very differently in when you</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.230" end="01:01:05.560" style="s2">think of it as in framing is like</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.550" end="01:01:07.600" style="s2">something coming from the outside and</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.560" end="01:01:09.340" style="s2">but kind of like overpowering but now</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.600" end="01:01:11.650" style="s2">it&#39;s actually much worse right it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.340" end="01:01:14.770" style="s2">more subtle it&#39;s in it&#39;s in it&#39;s in how</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.650" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">things appear and are and with the guilt</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.770" end="01:01:19.870" style="s2">it&#39;s basically just you know the guild</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.880" style="s2">guilds were what build the first</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.870" end="01:01:24.040" style="s2">universities so I don&#39;t know where this</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.880" end="01:01:26.590" style="s2">is going to lead of course but as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.040" end="01:01:28.690" style="s2">guilt it just brings together people so</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.590" end="01:01:31.270" style="s2">for example we&#39;re doing a book</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.690" end="01:01:33.340" style="s2">publication next week Shawn Burke&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.270" end="01:01:34.900" style="s2">artist from Pasadena he&#39;s written a book</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.340" end="01:01:37.990" style="s2">winter and summer you know remembering</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.900" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">who we are is basically the subtitle and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.990" end="01:01:41.260" style="s2">aesthetics of memory I think is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:43.810" style="s2">subtitle that&#39;ll be out next week so</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.260" end="01:01:46.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll do book publications and course</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.810" end="01:01:49.360" style="s2">listen we&#39;ll see her release is just</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">bringing a couple of eccentric types</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.360" end="01:01:55.270" style="s2">together and then those eccentric types</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.490" style="s2">they can maybe build the next university</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.270" end="01:02:01.300" style="s2">because what we&#39;re seeing now is if they</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.490" end="01:02:03.700" style="s2">fire that many people they&#39;re using pure</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.300" end="01:02:08.560" style="s2">market terms it&#39;s pure market logic</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.700" end="01:02:11.500" style="s2">that&#39;s how you destroy a brand and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.560" end="01:02:14.200" style="s2">for the coming decades I&#39;m I think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.500" end="01:02:18.220" style="s2">you know private or or cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.200" end="01:02:19.690" style="s2">education then doesn&#39;t thrive because</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.220" end="01:02:22.390" style="s2">people are open to it this is why the</p>
