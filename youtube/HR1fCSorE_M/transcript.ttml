<p begin="00:00:00.949" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">hi this is a video tutorial on what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">mean we say something is transcendent or</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">transcendence as a category the idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:24.029" style="s2">here is that we are trying to pair the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:34.969" style="s2">notion of transcendence with eminence</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.029" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">and a fractal iteration some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.969" end="00:00:46.649" style="s2">dimensionality so those are big words</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:51.149" style="s2">but I really want you to see that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.649" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">get very close to some simple concepts</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.149" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">to understand transcendence as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">imminent property of being so if we look</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:11.600" style="s2">at this grid here of stems we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">imagine each one of these four member</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.600" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">stems as being some kind of phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:27.350" style="s2">or a class of existence or perhaps some</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">kind of species and if we look at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.350" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">axis as evolutionary time then we see</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">that each one of these beings the ADC</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">b/d being the X bcz being they all have</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">the same evolutionary frequency or what</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">we might call age so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:10.940" style="s2">ontological temporal order it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">time ecology of ocean as an ontology</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.940" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">and in this case everything started at</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:25.900" style="s2">the same time as we&#39;ve driven drawn it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:28.130" style="s2">and has gone on to the present if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.900" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">discounted if we took some of these out</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.130" end="00:02:35.690" style="s2">we could see perhaps that ABCD isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:38.030" style="s2">more recent form than the others because</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.690" end="00:02:40.970" style="s2">they had only started at this time one</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.030" end="00:02:44.330" style="s2">but for now I&#39;ve just drawn them so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.970" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">they have the same starting point and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.330" end="00:02:50.390" style="s2">they come up to the future so they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">an evolutionary age of in this case for</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.390" end="00:03:03.100" style="s2">or eons for or whatever that is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:05.870" style="s2">iteration ready so that the species are</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.100" end="00:03:08.870" style="s2">reproducing themselves over time or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.870" end="00:03:12.500" style="s2">phenomenon is reoccurring over time so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.870" end="00:03:15.320" style="s2">that&#39;s an iteration evolutionary so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.500" end="00:03:16.910" style="s2">do we mean by fractal in iteration well</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.320" end="00:03:21.010" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for its second order</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.910" end="00:03:24.890" style="s2">dimensionality so for example the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.010" end="00:03:32.890" style="s2">characteristic be iterates in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.890" end="00:03:38.650" style="s2">different dimension so we can call this</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.890" end="00:03:45.800" style="s2">depth if we want to and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.650" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">there are certain levels of death so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.800" end="00:03:55.600" style="s2">have here 1 2 3 4 5 B has appeared five</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:59.330" style="s2">times 1 2 3 4 5 2 has appeared two times</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.600" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">in this direction so we can graph it</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.330" end="00:04:06.230" style="s2">yours to my ex appears four times SS</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:12.769" style="s2">appears once L once and 31 so this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.230" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">can be little diagram simple diagram of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.769" end="00:04:19.520" style="s2">the iterative depth of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:24.100" style="s2">characteristics in the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.520" end="00:04:30.790" style="s2">record so we can see that this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.100" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">depth creates a another dimension or</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.790" end="00:04:44.590" style="s2">another scale it dimensions or scale but</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">it&#39;s an abstract concept it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.590" end="00:04:52.020" style="s2">abstraction because there is no BB DVD</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:55.510" style="s2">thing class of existence there is no to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.020" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">class of existence there is no X class</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.510" end="00:05:02.680" style="s2">of existence they never these</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:06.790" style="s2">characteristics these abstractions never</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.680" end="00:05:11.590" style="s2">occur by themselves there is no X there</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.790" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">is no be there is no 2 there&#39;s only XB s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.590" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">s XB 2 3 ABCD and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:23.260" style="s2">abstractions to another scale of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:27.430" style="s2">dimensions but they do iterate fractally</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.260" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">what i mean by fractally is that fractal</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.430" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">iteration means the repetition of saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:37.960" style="s2">the same pneus across different scales</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">and so b is is repeating in this scale</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.960" end="00:05:47.260" style="s2">you can imagine for example a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:54.610" style="s2">bees repeating off to this scale X is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.260" end="00:05:59.620" style="s2">repeating in this scale and joining with</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.610" end="00:06:02.020" style="s2">be sometimes here sometimes joining with</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:05.380" style="s2">SS sometimes joining with this and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.020" end="00:06:08.050" style="s2">s would have depth across this scale and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">so what you end up getting is this whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.050" end="00:06:19.000" style="s2">fractal dimensionality of all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:21.100" style="s2">aspects so this iteration and now that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.000" end="00:06:24.100" style="s2">you see things show up iterates</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.100" end="00:06:28.180" style="s2">fractally across many multiple</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.100" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">dimensions so from the point of girth of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.180" end="00:06:37.780" style="s2">science we can say that if we follow</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">this kind of trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.780" end="00:06:46.980" style="s2">iterative depth then this green line</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">here is the kind of neat illustration of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.980" end="00:06:55.510" style="s2">what Goethe would call the ideal form</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:07:00.340" style="s2">right so nothing actually exists there</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.510" end="00:07:05.590" style="s2">is no creature that exists in this form</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.340" end="00:07:12.790" style="s2">whoops so there is no creature that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.590" end="00:07:15.160" style="s2">exists in this form of depth 5 because</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.790" end="00:07:20.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of death but what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.160" end="00:07:25.870" style="s2">done here is uncovered an imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.820" end="00:07:29.590" style="s2">ideal being of this class if all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.870" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">were a certain class of harm let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.590" end="00:07:39.330" style="s2">this would be the ideal that shows up as</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:39.330" style="s2">the fractal iteration of imminent forms</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.750" end="00:07:49.169" style="s2">so how can we talk about this further</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.960" end="00:08:09.000" style="s2">what we can then say is that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.390" end="00:08:19.410" style="s2">movement as we said in this direction is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.000" end="00:08:19.410" style="s2">evolution yep in this direction is depth</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.610" end="00:08:32.380" style="s2">but when we abstract the element we look</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.160" end="00:08:36.789" style="s2">at it as an abstract concept then we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.380" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">see that depth is associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.789" end="00:08:42.940" style="s2">process that we called in volitional so</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:48.339" style="s2">we get this impression when we take the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.940" end="00:08:50.110" style="s2">abstraction and then we create the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.339" end="00:08:51.089" style="s2">narrative process of how it gets in</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.110" end="00:08:53.430" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.089" end="00:08:58.769" style="s2">see that that abstractions or</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.430" end="00:09:02.759" style="s2">involutions of transcendence it appears</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.769" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">to be transcended characteristic seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.759" end="00:09:08.579" style="s2">seem to be embedded or transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:13.589" style="s2">incentive iterations they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.579" end="00:09:19.709" style="s2">involuted over time into these forms so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.589" end="00:09:22.199" style="s2">we create a pattern abstraction abstract</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.709" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">it from the imminent form we create the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.199" end="00:09:29.610" style="s2">process and think of those forms as</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:33.509" style="s2">being out there somehow involuted into</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.610" end="00:09:41.069" style="s2">the horns yeah so that would be then</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.509" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">depth associated with involution now</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.069" end="00:09:47.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a little more to the story and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:59.220" style="s2">that is when this let&#39;s say creature</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.490" end="00:10:02.429" style="s2">here xb SS develops not evolves so when</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.220" end="00:10:10.499" style="s2">one of these creatures so we have Logan</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.429" end="00:10:15.059" style="s2">of XP SS baby first it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.499" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">let&#39;s say the dividing egg and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.059" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">going to become a full-fledged XP SS in</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.179" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">this form the full characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.850" end="00:10:40.769" style="s2">this combination is not manifest but</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:45.749" style="s2">these the potentials of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.769" end="00:10:54.149" style="s2">combinations are involuted in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.749" end="00:11:04.060" style="s2">potentials so as this form or being</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.149" end="00:11:12.860" style="s2">arises on to genetic processes or</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.060" end="00:11:15.140" style="s2">Joel cause a morphogenetic then we see</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.860" end="00:11:18.230" style="s2">that there is the actual imminent</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.140" end="00:11:23.030" style="s2">process of evolution so this is where</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.230" end="00:11:27.620" style="s2">involution actually becomes imminent in</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.030" end="00:11:35.090" style="s2">the ontogenetic temporalities of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.620" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">morphogenesis of the form so this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.090" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">just a little brief explanation of how</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:49.430" style="s2">to discuss the categories of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:52.300" style="s2">evolution transcendence and imminence in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.430" end="00:11:55.430" style="s2">order to see that all transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.300" end="00:11:58.540" style="s2">categories are actually imminent and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.430" end="00:12:01.610" style="s2">we can see this the stronger the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:06.080" style="s2">repetition so in this case B occurs five</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.610" end="00:12:12.170" style="s2">times the stronger the repetition the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.080" end="00:12:14.900" style="s2">higher we see we view the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.170" end="00:12:18.140" style="s2">category see it as a higher transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">right so the stronger the repetition the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.140" end="00:12:24.290" style="s2">higher transcendent but when you derived</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">transcendence from this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.290" end="00:12:31.100" style="s2">fractal iteration of it immanence in a</p>
