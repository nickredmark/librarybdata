<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:14.190" style="s2">the issue is with Eric once Arick joins</p>

<p begin="00:02:19.830" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">this ok who would like to start sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.989" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">on what gave me project they would like</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">to support in 2020 I&#39;ve got a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">radical proposal is not really a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">particular project like sport but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">like to put an idea out there and see</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:42.090" style="s2">see if there&#39;s any any any any</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">enthusiasm for it I have actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.090" end="00:02:48.750" style="s2">mentioned it before namely to use a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">Jubilee you know use that Jubilee weapon</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.750" end="00:02:53.819" style="s2">not not you Jubilee but the Jubilee do</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:58.709" style="s2">you all know what the Jubilee is do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">know what I&#39;m talking about no ok</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.709" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">I&#39;ll very very briefly explaining things</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">it won&#39;t take me long I&#39;m not my idea is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">really simple but the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:07.950" style="s2">Jubilee is essential to understand so</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:10.650" style="s2">basically it&#39;s an undertaking that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.950" end="00:03:12.690" style="s2">people make anonymously until such time</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.650" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">as a threshold number is reached once a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.690" end="00:03:15.540" style="s2">certain number of people have made that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:17.070" style="s2">commitment then it is opened up it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.540" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">becomes transparent and open to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.070" end="00:03:22.019" style="s2">everybody and so it can be used for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">anything what it does is it negates the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.019" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">thing of well well there&#39;s no point in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:26.579" style="s2">me doing it on my own because that makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:27.989" style="s2">no difference right in all that happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.579" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">as they throw me in jail if I do it on</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.989" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">my own where a million people through it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case anymore right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like a safety in numbers thing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">is the idea of it leverages it leverages</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">the public&#39;s power so anyway I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:42.390" style="s2">like to use and I&#39;m happy to talk more</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.440" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">about it afterwards I don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.390" end="00:03:48.320" style="s2">through long in this bit but I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">like to use it to try and put an end to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.320" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">standardized testing in state education</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">well in all education actually a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:57.299" style="s2">state education see that&#39;s what educates</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:58.709" style="s2">most children and you know it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.299" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2">the testing itself it&#39;s everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.709" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">goes around the testing the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">curriculums around the test schools</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:05.549" style="s2">being measured by their test results</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">teachers being paid by their tested bla</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.549" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">bla bla bla bla bla bla all the shit</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:10.829" style="s2">that goes along with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">so I think the Jubilee it would be it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.829" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">would be a really good thing to use it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:14.639" style="s2">on because it&#39;s not too explosive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">not like bringing down the economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.639" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">system right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:22.409" style="s2">of and so it could be a test run for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">concept as well as being an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.409" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">to put an</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:27.819" style="s2">into this incredibly poisonous thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:32.710" style="s2">that exists in our society and and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.819" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">stop there all right would anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.710" end="00:04:35.860" style="s2">like to go now and even pause I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:40.750" style="s2">even mute us I&#39;m pretty good at not</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.860" end="00:04:45.910" style="s2">interrupting each other now you know our</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.750" end="00:04:47.970" style="s2">branch or I can go as well I can go so</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.110" end="00:07:10.820" style="s2">Jordan Hall posted an article and I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:13.400" style="s2">the part I&#39;m interested in is the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.820" end="00:07:16.100" style="s2">is the emotional triage that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.400" end="00:07:18.620" style="s2">the realization that oshit life isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.100" end="00:07:22.490" style="s2">what I think it is and because there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.620" end="00:07:25.700" style="s2">a massive amount of stuff to work</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.490" end="00:07:26.990" style="s2">through and you know how do you and like</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.700" end="00:07:29.600" style="s2">and in the conversation I was having</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.990" end="00:07:31.790" style="s2">with you know a couple weeks ago it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.600" end="00:07:33.500" style="s2">like my journey was part of my journey</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.790" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">with coming off of psych meds that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.500" end="00:07:38.270" style="s2">basically took several years where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:42.170" style="s2">just need a and I didn&#39;t have like as</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.270" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">much or as I think people need and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.170" end="00:07:48.860" style="s2">basically I needed good things to just</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:52.340" style="s2">like not deal with life for an extended</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.860" end="00:07:54.920" style="s2">couple of years and sort of like cocoon</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.340" end="00:07:57.230" style="s2">while I dealt with all of the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.920" end="00:07:59.450" style="s2">stuff and so how to create an</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.230" end="00:08:01.370" style="s2">environment where that&#39;s possible I</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.450" end="00:08:04.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly how to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.370" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m interested in doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.510" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">Oh Bradford you want me to go I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:18.550" style="s2">it a try I&#39;m not very prepared today and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:20.770" style="s2">this is a tough question right like what</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.550" end="00:08:22.480" style="s2">what game B projects do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.770" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">support like there&#39;s thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.480" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">thousands of nonprofits and projects</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:31.240" style="s2">that are asking for support that deserve</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:33.880" style="s2">support and you know someone like me</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.240" end="00:08:37.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have anything to give except my</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.880" end="00:08:41.080" style="s2">time and I already give all my time to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.540" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">what you know whatever project so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.080" end="00:08:47.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:53.380" style="s2">stagnation and kind of paralysis like</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.170" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">what what do we do and um you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.380" end="00:08:58.060" style="s2">of a lot of charities and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:09:02.410" style="s2">philanthropy is like like if you support</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.060" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">them you&#39;re not necessarily helping game</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.410" end="00:09:07.230" style="s2">be you might be helping gate may write a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:12.690" style="s2">lot of charities and philanthropies are</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.230" end="00:09:15.100" style="s2">corrupt or dysfunctional or even</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.690" end="00:09:16.990" style="s2">best-case scenario they just they just</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.100" end="00:09:20.170" style="s2">don&#39;t work or they don&#39;t change the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.990" end="00:09:23.410" style="s2">system they just try to address a kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.170" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">of externality that no one else is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.410" end="00:09:28.840" style="s2">dealing with um so in terms of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:32.550" style="s2">what am I gonna focus on in 2020 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.840" end="00:09:37.210" style="s2">you know my own work a lot of meta stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.550" end="00:09:41.800" style="s2">Bernie Sanders movements and and I say</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.210" end="00:09:43.420" style="s2">movement and campaign um because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.800" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">all these things it takes us all of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.420" end="00:09:54.600" style="s2">converging and a lot of these projects</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">merging there&#39;s one there&#39;s one like</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.600" end="00:09:59.830" style="s2">kind of project that that pops into my</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:02.860" style="s2">head though as something I do want to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.830" end="00:10:05.560" style="s2">involved with but it you know it&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.860" end="00:10:10.420" style="s2">yet to be seen if it&#39;s yet another just</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.560" end="00:10:13.140" style="s2">kind of you know front or well</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.420" end="00:10:15.570" style="s2">intentioned attempt or if it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.140" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t make it impact and that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.570" end="00:10:21.780" style="s2">Robert Downey jr. is footprint Cole</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.360" end="00:10:25.620" style="s2">and just listen to him talk about it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.780" end="00:10:29.250" style="s2">pretty inspiring because he directly you</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.620" end="00:10:32.180" style="s2">know takes a lot of his ideas from kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.250" end="00:10:37.500" style="s2">of being Iron Man for for ten plus years</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.180" end="00:10:40.520" style="s2">and uh you know like Brett rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.500" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">that being just like a like a mmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.520" end="00:10:45.810" style="s2">egocentric actor thing or a publicity</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:46.290" style="s2">stunt like he&#39;s he&#39;s pretty serious</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.810" end="00:10:50.540" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.290" end="00:10:56.460" style="s2">and I think I think there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.540" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">ethics and methodology to the the role</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.460" end="00:11:00.990" style="s2">that he played in in the Marvel</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:03.030" style="s2">Cinematic Universe like specifically</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.990" end="00:11:05.250" style="s2">wanting to you know dismantle the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.030" end="00:11:08.220" style="s2">military-industrial complex like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.250" end="00:11:11.430" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what Tony&#39;s Arc is about</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.220" end="00:11:13.520" style="s2">so you know Robert Downey jr. as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.430" end="00:11:16.830" style="s2">person like Eaton he knows that he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.520" end="00:11:19.260" style="s2">actually Tony Stark and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.830" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">superhero but he wants to step into this</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.260" end="00:11:23.960" style="s2">into this role I&#39;ll do what he can</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:28.590" style="s2">because he understands the stakes and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.960" end="00:11:30.780" style="s2">kind of like bit that were we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.590" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">about a massive transition not just some</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.780" end="00:11:41.010" style="s2">band-aid solution to a particular social</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">or ecological issue so yeah though those</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.010" end="00:11:44.820" style="s2">things are all what I really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.690" end="00:11:47.700" style="s2">say just I&#39;m gonna keep working on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.820" end="00:11:51.450" style="s2">on the big picture on my research and on</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.700" end="00:11:56.760" style="s2">the socio-political movement the EDS</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.450" end="00:11:59.070" style="s2">that dovetail with that thanks Brett</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.760" end="00:12:01.890" style="s2">focusing on in 2020 I have my own</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.070" end="00:12:05.820" style="s2">project Jubilee project that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.890" end="00:12:07.470" style="s2">table iam project on creating the global</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.820" end="00:12:11.820" style="s2">cooperative but being in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.470" end="00:12:13.710" style="s2">space I&#39;m also learning how much of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.820" end="00:12:15.270" style="s2">I have already done has to be thrown</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.710" end="00:12:17.820" style="s2">away so that we can create it together</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.270" end="00:12:20.190" style="s2">and having the frustration of being in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.820" end="00:12:21.510" style="s2">space the old personnel&#39;s frustration of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.190" end="00:12:24.360" style="s2">being in a space where we all have our</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.510" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">own projects but how do any of them get</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.360" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">made or even ones that are very similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:28.660" style="s2">how do we choose between them or how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:31.029" style="s2">we melt them</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:33.759" style="s2">together and how do way so for 2020 what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.029" end="00:12:36.670" style="s2">I would like to do personally and with</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.759" end="00:12:39.009" style="s2">other game B people is one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.670" end="00:12:41.050" style="s2">or potentially both which is create a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.009" end="00:12:43.959" style="s2">tool a very simple tool for</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.050" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">conversations because this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.959" end="00:12:47.649" style="s2">powerful part of both like creating a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:50.350" style="s2">project doing the interpersonal work of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.649" end="00:12:54.209" style="s2">not going through it show up self</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.350" end="00:12:56.230" style="s2">development and all of that time and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.209" end="00:12:57.579" style="s2">uncomfortableness or pain that goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.230" end="00:12:59.529" style="s2">through the progression you need to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.579" end="00:13:02.649" style="s2">through and conversation and community</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.529" end="00:13:04.329" style="s2">makes it easier especially when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.649" end="00:13:05.860" style="s2">don&#39;t need to put in a lot of the effort</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.329" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">to find that community and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.860" end="00:13:11.350" style="s2">conversations I just posted on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">Facebook group for a request for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.350" end="00:13:15.129" style="s2">question like I want to talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">at decentralization and why that scene</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.129" end="00:13:19.750" style="s2">is the end-all be-all of tools for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.060" style="s2">technology like why is that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.750" end="00:13:24.339" style="s2">concentrating on and I want to have that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.060" end="00:13:26.019" style="s2">conversation not necessarily for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.339" end="00:13:28.089" style="s2">game be space but like for my learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.019" end="00:13:29.199" style="s2">because I keep getting from lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.089" end="00:13:30.910" style="s2">better word triggered when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.199" end="00:13:33.459" style="s2">decentralization in the space because</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.910" end="00:13:34.569" style="s2">I&#39;m like what like you&#39;re not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.459" end="00:13:36.819" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about generally isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.569" end="00:13:38.259" style="s2">fixes decentralization in my opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.819" end="00:13:41.050" style="s2">so it&#39;s about going anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.259" end="00:13:43.720" style="s2">I want to be able to have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.050" end="00:13:45.850" style="s2">I&#39;m already doing that myself I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.720" end="00:13:47.410" style="s2">that throughout the week and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.850" end="00:13:48.819" style="s2">cafe but I want to be able to create a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.410" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">platform that makes it easy for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.819" end="00:13:53.889" style="s2">to be able to schedule any conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.089" style="s2">they want to have with other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.889" end="00:13:57.069" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s one of the best</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.069" end="00:14:00.100" style="s2">projects that&#39;s one is figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.930" end="00:14:01.540" style="s2">to have a conversation under a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.100" end="00:14:04.050" style="s2">collaboration platform I guess no</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.540" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">conversation platform the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.050" end="00:14:07.720" style="s2">what I think of as a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:09.880" style="s2">platform it may be that&#39;s not what it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.720" end="00:14:11.649" style="s2">comes out to be is that since everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.880" end="00:14:12.579" style="s2">has their own project since everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.649" end="00:14:14.589" style="s2">their own thing that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.579" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">whether that&#39;s the personal work whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.589" end="00:14:19.660" style="s2">that&#39;s their own real life project or</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:21.339" style="s2">online project that to bring those</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.660" end="00:14:22.809" style="s2">people together with their unique</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.339" end="00:14:24.370" style="s2">individual selves and their needs and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.809" end="00:14:27.759" style="s2">their projects needs and their projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.370" end="00:14:30.550" style="s2">pitfalls and and you know um potential</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.759" end="00:14:32.379" style="s2">how can we help one another right now in</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.550" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">this space right what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.379" end="00:14:36.850" style="s2">stopping your individual project and how</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">can we facilitate each other how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.850" end="00:14:42.370" style="s2">help distribute trust amongst us right</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">so that if you have a new</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.370" end="00:14:47.650" style="s2">for a project and it&#39;s created if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:49.960" style="s2">have a way to back each other&#39;s projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.650" end="00:14:51.520" style="s2">in trust or so than in finances to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.960" end="00:14:53.890" style="s2">wait do we trust it and how do we trust</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.520" end="00:14:55.390" style="s2">it which seems to be one of those magic</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.890" end="00:14:57.210" style="s2">things that decentralization somehow</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.390" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">just solves without actually solving it</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.210" end="00:15:02.380" style="s2">is that so bringing people together to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.270" style="s2">have like a meta project on how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.380" end="00:15:06.010" style="s2">actually help each other&#39;s projects and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.270" end="00:15:08.050" style="s2">what can you create is it any of ours</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.010" end="00:15:10.990" style="s2">but is all of ours that helps facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.050" end="00:15:14.770" style="s2">the individual ones as well as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.990" end="00:15:16.270" style="s2">for conversation just like what you want</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.770" end="00:15:17.950" style="s2">to talk about schedules it with people</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:19.630" style="s2">from different time zones and puts you</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.950" end="00:15:21.430" style="s2">on a screen with for people not</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.630" end="00:15:25.420" style="s2">necessarily broadcast on YouTube just</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.430" end="00:15:27.370" style="s2">for your own personal growth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.420" end="00:15:28.300" style="s2">learning and you can happen on and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.370" end="00:15:29.589" style="s2">know if you see how other people have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.300" end="00:15:31.510" style="s2">conversation that you&#39;re not available</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.589" end="00:15:33.279" style="s2">for you could say hey I still want to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.510" end="00:15:35.020" style="s2">part of a conversation like that but my</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.279" end="00:15:37.380" style="s2">time doesn&#39;t line up or that spots</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.020" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">already full who else is available and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.380" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">can make it for game people but it can</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:46.510" style="s2">be for a broader audience as well so</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.800" end="00:15:57.310" style="s2">that is what I will be concentrating on</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.510" end="00:16:01.420" style="s2">in 2020 I like the notion of a communal</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.310" end="00:16:02.920" style="s2">space where a conversation that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.420" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2">be had that&#39;s a place where it can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.920" end="00:16:07.690" style="s2">had right and so people can organize</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:09.010" style="s2">around that space I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.690" end="00:16:11.800" style="s2">couple of things came up while you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.010" end="00:16:13.540" style="s2">talking the decentralization thing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.800" end="00:16:15.339" style="s2">mean in a way what you are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.540" end="00:16:17.910" style="s2">project you&#39;re talking about facilitates</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.339" end="00:16:20.950" style="s2">exactly that right it allows things to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.910" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">come about spontaneously without any</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.950" end="00:16:24.370" style="s2">kind of external direction that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:27.339" style="s2">decentralization is all about right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.370" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">you don&#39;t have an authority whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.339" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.730" end="00:16:31.089" style="s2">King em for a government think tank</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.190" style="s2">whatever it doesn&#39;t matter but there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.089" end="00:16:34.630" style="s2">not an authority figuring out what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.190" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">best plan is and then distributing it to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.630" end="00:16:38.080" style="s2">everyone right that&#39;s that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:40.150" style="s2">that centralization so what you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.080" end="00:16:43.170" style="s2">advocating with your whole your whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.150" end="00:16:45.870" style="s2">speech basically is a is a plea for</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.170" end="00:16:48.490" style="s2">decentralization right for distributed</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">for distributed networks of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.490" end="00:16:51.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:52.750" style="s2">advocating for so I think that to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.760" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.750" end="00:16:55.840" style="s2">decentralization means Kira sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:16:57.160" style="s2">just going to bury</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.840" end="00:17:02.700" style="s2">quickly go in a circle and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.160" end="00:17:02.700" style="s2">shut up but here are your desire to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.270" end="00:17:08.380" style="s2">create like a halfway house sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.980" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">thing for people that are coming through</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.380" end="00:17:14.320" style="s2">their awakening or whatever whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:15.850" style="s2">is you want to call it this - yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.320" end="00:17:17.440" style="s2">mean language is so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.850" end="00:17:19.240" style="s2">hi everyone brings different things but</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.440" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">anyway wait I think I know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.240" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:25.510" style="s2">the I don&#39;t know if you saw it a few</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.370" end="00:19:09.430" style="s2">having one question that was driving</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.870" end="00:19:17.350" style="s2">the metaphor the metaphor how do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.640" end="00:19:19.270" style="s2">represent all of the things that people</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.850" end="00:19:26.290" style="s2">end up with ten trees that are all doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.310" end="00:19:29.380" style="s2">different things and nobody&#39;s talking to</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.560" end="00:20:15.720" style="s2">create that opportunity for connections</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.440" end="00:20:21.400" style="s2">I really liked the structure and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.570" end="00:20:23.410" style="s2">I guess what I mean by did not turn this</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.400" end="00:20:24.940" style="s2">into the decentralization conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.410" end="00:20:27.010" style="s2">because I put that on Facebook too how</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.940" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">that is a unique one but like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.010" end="00:20:30.010" style="s2">project is amazing I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.540" end="00:20:31.990" style="s2">essential in east-central I see them as</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.010" end="00:20:33.820" style="s2">having solved a problem using the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.990" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">tool they have under their disposal</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.820" end="00:20:37.030" style="s2">right this idea of branch internals new</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:39.040" style="s2">apparent turtle and child turtle but</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.030" end="00:20:40.450" style="s2">there&#39;s no hierarchy like it solves the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.040" end="00:20:42.370" style="s2">problem without making it too</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.450" end="00:20:45.160" style="s2">centralized right it&#39;s centralized</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.370" end="00:20:47.470" style="s2">actually and so that&#39;s the issue of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.160" end="00:20:48.730" style="s2">like listening to the forest laundry</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.470" end="00:20:50.440" style="s2">thing this morning where they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.730" end="00:20:52.780" style="s2">talking about like Facebook&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.440" end="00:20:54.550" style="s2">because it&#39;s not decentralized so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.780" end="00:20:56.230" style="s2">need the central and I&#39;m like wait no</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.550" end="00:20:59.500" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s broken because it has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.230" end="00:21:01.570" style="s2">for-profit model and it&#39;s game a if it</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.500" end="00:21:03.610" style="s2">if we all owned it and we can decide</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.570" end="00:21:05.620" style="s2">what tools to add to it it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.610" end="00:21:07.150" style="s2">amazingly powerful tool and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.620" end="00:21:09.850" style="s2">centralization would make it more</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.150" end="00:21:11.590" style="s2">powerful not less so but that&#39;s but by</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.850" end="00:21:13.450" style="s2">definition that&#39;s decentralized if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.590" end="00:21:15.160" style="s2">owned by all of us by definition it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.450" end="00:21:16.870" style="s2">deed that is that is decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.160" end="00:21:18.700" style="s2">right that is distribution of ownership</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.870" end="00:21:21.190" style="s2">those decentralization of ownership so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.700" end="00:21:22.840" style="s2">yeah I think I think it&#39;s actually think</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.190" end="00:21:24.250" style="s2">your issue with centralization</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.840" end="00:21:28.500" style="s2">semantics one I think it&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.250" end="00:21:30.790" style="s2">bring to the word is is the thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.500" end="00:21:32.260" style="s2">when I describe what I&#39;m doing I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.790" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">a technology company we all own together</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.260" end="00:21:35.830" style="s2">so can create the tools to solve our</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">problems who were like no that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.830" end="00:21:40.060" style="s2">like centralized Asia and I&#39;m like do</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">you listen to Facebook does Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.060" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">dictate your life do you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:46.540" style="s2">a real powerful control over your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:48.430" style="s2">but I&#39;m not listening to the mother I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.540" end="00:21:49.900" style="s2">have kids with who devotes like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.430" end="00:21:53.050" style="s2">I&#39;m listening for base for their</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.900" end="00:21:55.240" style="s2">algorithm we can do that together so</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.050" end="00:21:56.830" style="s2">it&#39;s much more transparent and like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.240" end="00:21:58.210" style="s2">would make its you vote for one person</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.830" end="00:22:00.580" style="s2">because we wouldn&#39;t have enough people</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.210" end="00:22:03.730" style="s2">to want to be like Bernie Sanders is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.580" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">one we all would want truth in politics</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.730" end="00:22:07.870" style="s2">which means Bernie Sanders might come up</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:09.700" style="s2">as the frontrunner based on truth and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.870" end="00:22:11.350" style="s2">what we actually want with you know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.700" end="00:22:13.180" style="s2">I mean like without pursing an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.350" end="00:22:14.740" style="s2">and that&#39;s where like it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.180" end="00:22:16.180" style="s2">like disagreement that&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.740" end="00:22:19.300" style="s2">disagreement which is why I want to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.180" end="00:22:20.890" style="s2">this conversation and I&#39;m getting fairly</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.300" end="00:22:22.120" style="s2">good at like whatever pretty good up to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.890" end="00:22:24.100" style="s2">the University like this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.120" end="00:22:27.430" style="s2">here&#39;s the time period people show up</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.100" end="00:22:29.500" style="s2">but they don&#39;t show up but I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.430" end="00:22:30.730" style="s2">far along in that and other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.500" end="00:22:32.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t and other people see people</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.730" end="00:22:34.030" style="s2">having conversations and they it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.440" end="00:22:35.410" style="s2">vulnerable to put yourself out there and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.030" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">want to have that and then not be able</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.410" end="00:22:39.460" style="s2">to have people respond to it right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:41.740" style="s2">having a tool that just makes this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.460" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">process easy if it&#39;s just like wait what</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.740" end="00:22:45.790" style="s2">kind of conversations do we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:47.500" style="s2">and how do we just as simple to oh like</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.790" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">how do you get people to conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.500" end="00:22:51.730" style="s2">around the topic or a question that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:53.920" style="s2">want to participate in what does that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.730" end="00:22:55.300" style="s2">tool look like that we all can create</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.920" end="00:22:58.420" style="s2">together or not because if I create the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.300" end="00:22:59.920" style="s2">idea cafe it&#39;s for me write it like it</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.420" end="00:23:02.380" style="s2">solves my need of like I like each</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.920" end="00:23:03.790" style="s2">taking five minutes and then having a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.380" end="00:23:07.750" style="s2">conversation at the end it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.790" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">formatted unformatted for me but doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.750" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">make it fit everybody so like getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.300" style="s2">people together to have the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.040" style="s2">about what does that tool look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.300" end="00:23:16.870" style="s2">maybe nobody else in the game bSpace has</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.040" end="00:23:18.160" style="s2">this problem than I do in which case I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.870" end="00:23:22.420" style="s2">solving a problem only for me and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.160" end="00:23:23.950" style="s2">therefore won&#39;t be solves but that like</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.420" end="00:23:30.790" style="s2">just getting people to a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.950" end="00:23:32.980" style="s2">and making it much easier I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.790" end="00:23:34.630" style="s2">the one of the interesting parts of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.980" end="00:23:35.970" style="s2">is you know I think there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.630" end="00:23:38.190" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.970" end="00:23:39.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard I&#39;ve heard this talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.190" end="00:23:43.170" style="s2">in other places of their people who are</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.660" end="00:23:47.250" style="s2">living the game be who are living game</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.170" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">be but don&#39;t identify identify as game</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.250" end="00:23:59.610" style="s2">be and the and yeah there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.080" end="00:24:12.330" style="s2">know conversations popping up in terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.150" end="00:24:14.310" style="s2">of you know that the in that case it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.330" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">lot more of the emotional work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.310" end="00:24:20.970" style="s2">being done to move through you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:23.930" style="s2">to transition from you know kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.970" end="00:24:33.090" style="s2">a mentality to game be mentality and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.930" end="00:24:35.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a but there&#39;s and and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.090" end="00:24:41.940" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an element of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.700" end="00:24:45.780" style="s2">how do you how do we put this game a let</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.940" end="00:24:47.130" style="s2">game be language on you I&#39;m not on to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.780" end="00:24:50.790" style="s2">that&#39;s not the right word that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.130" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">exactly the right word but how do we if</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.790" end="00:24:57.780" style="s2">the the conversations that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:24:59.160" style="s2">and sort of bringing attention to places</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.780" end="00:25:02.670" style="s2">where that where people are already</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.160" end="00:25:04.620" style="s2">living that game beef you know where</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.670" end="00:25:08.970" style="s2">they&#39;re living game be but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.620" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">using that language yeah and I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.970" end="00:25:17.750" style="s2">and I don&#39;t even like necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:20.040" style="s2">process of you know calling it something</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.750" end="00:25:21.870" style="s2">because then you know it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">it you know the tower that you name is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.870" end="00:25:25.740" style="s2">not that&#39;s you know that&#39;s that type of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:27.660" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like once you name it it sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.740" end="00:25:30.030" style="s2">of like well is it that or is it not</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.660" end="00:25:31.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s that whole and it&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.030" end="00:25:33.090" style="s2">group out through then right isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.380" end="00:25:39.180" style="s2">yeah yeah we&#39;re getting you&#39;re not game</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.090" end="00:25:40.680" style="s2">be you know yeah it does I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.180" end="00:25:43.920" style="s2">because I&#39;m also in some of those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.680" end="00:25:45.330" style="s2">like and it&#39;s interesting because all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.920" end="00:25:48.850" style="s2">the different types of group seem to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.330" end="00:25:50.529" style="s2">form around one or two thought leaders</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.850" end="00:25:52.179" style="s2">whether that&#39;s spiritual because they</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.529" end="00:25:54.340" style="s2">can channel other things or their</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.179" end="00:25:56.340" style="s2">self-help guru or their you know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.340" end="00:26:00.070" style="s2">Hall or like whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.340" end="00:26:02.769" style="s2">and so it&#39;s alright when we have that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.070" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s harder to be more universal</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.769" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">because we&#39;re putting that somewhat of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">the higher like the power on a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:09.669" style="s2">right that these people are the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:11.830" style="s2">are disseminating our knowledge to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.669" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">rest of us and then we were banding</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.830" end="00:26:16.360" style="s2">together as an us-versus-them in some</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:18.009" style="s2">degree with them as like right because</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.360" end="00:26:19.509" style="s2">we all agree with what Jordan Hall says</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.009" end="00:26:20.740" style="s2">right even if we don&#39;t agree with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.509" end="00:26:22.809" style="s2">Hall says it becomes almost like</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.740" end="00:26:26.049" style="s2">entry-level that you have to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.809" end="00:26:27.429" style="s2">him and which I do have yet to hear</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.049" end="00:26:30.129" style="s2">Jordan of all say something that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.429" end="00:26:31.740" style="s2">agree with I can&#39;t say is actually true</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.129" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">for the other people that I follow</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.740" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">there&#39;s always something that I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:40.659" style="s2">with and having that like a piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:43.059" style="s2">is kind of like breaking down the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.659" end="00:26:45.490" style="s2">hierarchy of external versus internal</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.059" end="00:26:48.100" style="s2">knowledge in all the spaces right if</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.490" end="00:26:49.870" style="s2">what Jordans make sense to you then it</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.100" end="00:26:53.259" style="s2">becomes your truth and you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.870" end="00:26:55.779" style="s2">from your your truth not his yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.259" end="00:26:57.220" style="s2">from teal Swan and and Kyle sees who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.779" end="00:27:00.429" style="s2">the other ones that that I follow and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.220" end="00:27:02.830" style="s2">have more of a a group around that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.429" end="00:27:04.750" style="s2">like if what she says resonates with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.830" end="00:27:06.639" style="s2">go for it but don&#39;t call someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.750" end="00:27:08.769" style="s2">teal when you say that you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.639" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">Jordan Hall would agree with that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.769" end="00:27:13.299" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking Hall Jordan halls don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.600" end="00:27:15.370" style="s2">all he does an amazing job at it but no</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.299" end="00:27:17.230" style="s2">one else needs to be him we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.370" end="00:27:20.279" style="s2">ourselves which is like a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.230" end="00:27:22.600" style="s2">all of the information but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.279" end="00:27:26.669" style="s2">group making to have these people that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.600" end="00:27:26.669" style="s2">we all know right that are like weekend</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.940" end="00:27:30.730" style="s2">sorry care but just really quickly you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.289" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">can make it very good we were already a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.730" end="00:27:37.090" style="s2">group right and what brought us here was</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">that he articulated things in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.090" end="00:27:40.659" style="s2">you know what I mean and so we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:42.370" style="s2">already that group we just hadn&#39;t formed</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.659" end="00:27:44.409" style="s2">yet if you see what I mean does that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.370" end="00:27:46.330" style="s2">does that make sense yes is that so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.409" end="00:27:47.980" style="s2">group hasn&#39;t been created by simply been</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.330" end="00:27:51.100" style="s2">attracted to they were already in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.980" end="00:27:54.519" style="s2">existence in some unformed way does that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.100" end="00:27:58.029" style="s2">make sense yeah I think you&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.590" end="00:28:23.830" style="s2">to reaching out to random people online</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.920" end="00:28:26.110" style="s2">and asking them questions but I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.830" end="00:28:29.530" style="s2">that that&#39;s not something that everyone</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.130" end="00:29:01.000" style="s2">having that conversation gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.660" end="00:29:05.800" style="s2">courage to be able to express myself in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.000" end="00:29:07.480" style="s2">more openly in the group and not to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.800" end="00:29:10.750" style="s2">that that&#39;s what everyone should be</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.020" end="00:29:52.360" style="s2">area that I like but how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.050" end="00:29:53.860" style="s2">empower people you know to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.360" end="00:29:57.340" style="s2">they had that their voice is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.860" end="00:30:00.610" style="s2">important part of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.340" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">remember in one of I think I might have</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.610" end="00:30:03.910" style="s2">mentioned this last week that and one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:05.800" style="s2">the Congress in the conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.910" end="00:30:07.660" style="s2">Jordan and Denver Vicki they talked</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.800" end="00:30:09.190" style="s2">about you know like maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.660" end="00:30:12.280" style="s2">information that&#39;s needed is from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.190" end="00:30:16.360" style="s2">seven-year-old girl in Peru like but how</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.280" end="00:30:21.309" style="s2">do you you know how do you empower</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.360" end="00:30:22.990" style="s2">that voice and but then it&#39;s but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.309" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">there&#39;s that balance of between</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.990" end="00:30:27.640" style="s2">empowering somebody to want to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:32.429" style="s2">then oh wait I have a voice I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.640" end="00:30:35.950" style="s2">project it everywhere and I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.429" end="00:30:37.630" style="s2">and where&#39;s that line yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.950" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">that is a very important line because</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.630" end="00:30:42.040" style="s2">this idea that it could come from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">seven nine year old girl in Peru is huge</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.040" end="00:30:46.150" style="s2">it absolutely could you know why&#39;d it</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:48.520" style="s2">probably will oh right the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.150" end="00:30:50.980" style="s2">there&#39;s as someone who thinks I do have</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.520" end="00:30:52.900" style="s2">a solution but I can&#39;t quite articulate</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.980" end="00:30:54.730" style="s2">it and I can&#39;t quite it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.900" end="00:30:56.260" style="s2">systems aren&#39;t designed it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.730" end="00:30:59.140" style="s2">if you can&#39;t communicate it well I exist</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.260" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">like right but that is a sticking point</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.140" end="00:31:05.020" style="s2">like it&#39;s like but it exists in my head</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:07.480" style="s2">like it&#39;s where is the process to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.020" end="00:31:09.160" style="s2">through to say is this good is this not</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.480" end="00:31:12.760" style="s2">what can we try what can&#39;t we try</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.160" end="00:31:14.590" style="s2">because the barriers of entry it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.760" end="00:31:16.179" style="s2">it has to be something has to come</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.590" end="00:31:18.130" style="s2">through to somebody who has enough power</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.179" end="00:31:19.240" style="s2">and privilege to be able to get it out</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.130" end="00:31:21.070" style="s2">into the world the change they have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.240" end="00:31:24.220" style="s2">be able to communicate it to the masses</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.070" end="00:31:27.730" style="s2">and therefore we amplify voices that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.220" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">have better editing and sound better</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.730" end="00:31:31.690" style="s2">instead of like the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:33.700" style="s2">actual idea right the quality of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.690" end="00:31:36.760" style="s2">wait what did that proofing girl say and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.700" end="00:31:38.049" style="s2">is there gold there and there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.760" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">in a way where it&#39;s not this top-down</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.049" end="00:31:41.620" style="s2">structure we&#39;re all listening to these</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:43.570" style="s2">leaders and instead we&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.620" end="00:31:45.130" style="s2">each other and saying yes what is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.570" end="00:31:47.140" style="s2">there&#39;s something of gold there right</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.130" end="00:31:49.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something and things will still</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.140" end="00:31:53.230" style="s2">fall through the cracks but less so when</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.900" end="00:31:55.390" style="s2">we say if we truly believe it can come</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.230" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">from anyone we have to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.390" end="00:32:00.130" style="s2">everyone right and we have to find like</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.630" style="s2">play ovo mega role and find the like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.130" end="00:32:11.590" style="s2">signal in the noise even when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.630" end="00:32:20.980" style="s2">mostly no audience that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.590" end="00:32:21.370" style="s2">went away Brent you go anything um not</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.980" end="00:32:26.230" style="s2">really</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.230" end="00:32:29.230" style="s2">little bit more about Robert Downey jr.</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.880" end="00:32:33.820" style="s2">just just quickly about two minutes</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.590" end="00:32:42.070" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t like all the military</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.080" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">industrial complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.070" end="00:32:47.799" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s more my</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.399" end="00:32:49.750" style="s2">extrapolation I think more generally</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.799" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">it&#39;s just thing something like climate</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.750" end="00:32:58.240" style="s2">change you know exactly right that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.390" end="00:33:12.179" style="s2">using his resources and networks and</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.460" end="00:36:05.740" style="s2">comfortable I guess enough in this space</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.900" end="00:36:11.260" style="s2">that they feel like they can show up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.740" end="00:36:15.160" style="s2">get it wrong my gut feeling is that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.260" end="00:36:18.610" style="s2">do that by showing you can get it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.160" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">like we get it wrong on repeat we create</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.610" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">a culture that allows for mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:26.050" style="s2">allows for people to do all of the</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.050" end="00:36:30.250" style="s2">wrong on the path to getting it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.060" end="00:36:32.230" style="s2">right mess up on the Omega rule</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.250" end="00:36:35.550" style="s2">constantly while trying to get it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.230" end="00:36:38.200" style="s2">look get the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.550" end="00:36:40.090" style="s2">explain back to me what I just said so</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.200" end="00:36:42.610" style="s2">that we can see if we&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.090" end="00:36:44.830" style="s2">understanding even if it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.610" end="00:36:46.750" style="s2">getting us closer together than it being</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.830" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">right and not needing people to have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.750" end="00:36:51.790" style="s2">degree in our linguistics to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:55.230" style="s2">have a conversation and the more we</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.790" end="00:36:58.180" style="s2">allow that to happen I think the more</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.230" end="00:37:00.520" style="s2">allowing error it&#39;s encouraging error</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.180" end="00:37:03.250" style="s2">I mean errors good error reveals error</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.520" end="00:37:05.530" style="s2">teachers you know what I mean I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.250" end="00:37:07.060" style="s2">saw a great documentary a few years back</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:21.220" style="s2">mattress is quick to fail if the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.570" end="00:37:22.780" style="s2">is gonna fail let&#39;s find out quickly</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.220" end="00:37:24.460" style="s2">right so push it hard push it early and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.780" end="00:37:25.780" style="s2">if it&#39;s gonna fail then let&#39;s know</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.460" end="00:37:28.360" style="s2">quickly and let&#39;s move on to something</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.360" end="00:37:31.990" style="s2">something that&#39;s eventually gonna fail</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.370" style="s2">right quick to failure are there and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.990" end="00:37:35.710" style="s2">you know these these ideas are really</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.370" end="00:37:37.450" style="s2">important it&#39;s the opposite of what we</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.710" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">learn in school right this broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.450" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">thing you know getting the question</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:44.350" style="s2">right is is what we&#39;re trained to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:46.360" style="s2">right getting it wrong is no no that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.340" end="00:37:52.390" style="s2">shit right so getting stuff wrong is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.260" end="00:37:54.910" style="s2">very very I mean there&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.390" end="00:37:56.500" style="s2">of the standardized testing right this</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.910" end="00:37:58.120" style="s2">this whole mentality if it&#39;s right or</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.500" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong and you&#39;re good or you&#39;re bad</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.930" end="00:38:08.550" style="s2">absolute horror and so yeah sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.550" end="00:38:18.430" style="s2">not actually trying to standardize</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.550" end="00:38:23.020" style="s2">character well in there inherent in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:24.730" style="s2">is making it that you know doing away</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.020" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">with the idea that failure is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.730" end="00:38:28.270" style="s2">thing you know they&#39;re not there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:37.120" style="s2">there there&#39;s this concept of there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.270" end="00:38:38.770" style="s2">no failure only feedback exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.120" end="00:38:40.690" style="s2">comes from neuro linguistic programming</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.770" end="00:38:42.820" style="s2">I love it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.690" end="00:38:45.310" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s one that&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.310" end="00:38:48.790" style="s2">the a few minutes ago there was</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.930" end="00:38:50.860" style="s2">something that I was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.790" end="00:38:53.560" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t want to say it because I</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.860" end="00:38:57.910" style="s2">was afraid of being laughed at and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.560" end="00:38:59.740" style="s2">know that&#39;s you know well stow I and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.910" end="00:39:01.570" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say it because I&#39;m scared too</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.740" end="00:39:02.980" style="s2">and so you guys know that I&#39;m afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.570" end="00:39:05.970" style="s2">be that I&#39;m gonna be laughed at even if</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.980" end="00:39:05.970" style="s2">you do it&#39;s not gonna kill me</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.070" end="00:39:11.020" style="s2">there was so back in the early 90s there</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.250" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">was a book that came out I think is</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.020" end="00:39:15.100" style="s2">really nineties called The Celestine</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">Prophecy I&#39;d never ever heard I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.100" end="00:39:23.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard of it and I had never read</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:26.590" style="s2">it and recently somebody suggested that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.290" end="00:39:28.540" style="s2">I read it and so I did and to me there</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.590" end="00:39:30.430" style="s2">is something you know now that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.540" end="00:39:34.420" style="s2">understand kind of like the mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.430" end="00:39:36.340" style="s2">ideas it&#39;s a very melodic idea of kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.420" end="00:39:38.680" style="s2">of describing sort of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.340" end="00:39:40.420" style="s2">are emerging from from game be you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.680" end="00:39:42.430" style="s2">if you take it literally then it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.420" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">of silly but if you take it you know as</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.430" end="00:39:47.140" style="s2">a metaphor for what&#39;s happening it makes</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:49.300" style="s2">total sense of like okay if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:50.830" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s if like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.300" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">and it was you know if you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.830" end="00:39:54.580" style="s2">catch someone&#39;s eye and you like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.830" style="s2">know see each other maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.580" end="00:39:59.080" style="s2">something there to that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.830" end="00:40:00.700" style="s2">learn from each other and you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.080" end="00:40:03.160" style="s2">of the same thing and how do you enable</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.700" end="00:40:06.580" style="s2">that when you don&#39;t see each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.160" end="00:40:08.260" style="s2">faces so much online it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.580" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">there&#39;s that interesting conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.260" end="00:40:14.590" style="s2">and create it create a safety of if I</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.590" end="00:40:17.980" style="s2">want to share about it publicly</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:31.780" style="s2">who are very good at talking about ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.640" end="00:41:32.200" style="s2">and when you have that it&#39;s like wait a</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.040" end="00:41:53.130" style="s2">concept of safe spaces and we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.110" end="00:41:58.540" style="s2">to create safe space but do you want to</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.540" end="00:42:02.680" style="s2">mistakes I think that&#39;s ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.300" end="00:42:04.180" style="s2">people want when they talk about safe</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.680" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">spaces is they want to know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.180" end="00:42:11.050" style="s2">some place that they can go and like not</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">be ridiculed for making a mistake</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.670" end="00:42:22.690" style="s2">course of generations from a very tribal</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.460" end="00:42:25.390" style="s2">world where like if you thought outside</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.690" end="00:42:26.590" style="s2">of the box you got ostracized and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.390" end="00:42:28.330" style="s2">Internet has given us the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.590" end="00:42:31.390" style="s2">like form our own tribes and do but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.330" end="00:42:33.340" style="s2">also given us this mega tribe that like</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.390" end="00:42:35.590" style="s2">you do something wrong you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.340" end="00:42:37.480" style="s2">eviscerated and there&#39;s nowhere else to</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.480" end="00:42:42.370" style="s2">something slightly racist or wholly</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.390" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">racist right but like if you had said it</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.370" end="00:42:47.140" style="s2">at a party and gotten it wrong and like</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">got the feedback of like that&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.140" end="00:42:51.460" style="s2">racist and no it wouldn&#39;t you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:42:53.500" style="s2">mean it has more of a projection so it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.460" end="00:42:56.590" style="s2">has more of a consequence and like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.500" end="00:42:58.690" style="s2">making it so that honestly it&#39;s a safe</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.590" end="00:43:00.580" style="s2">space to even say things that you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.690" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">allowed to say online which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.580" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">what the safe space movement has done is</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">like you can&#39;t say anything so</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:07.030" style="s2">everyone&#39;s watching everything they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:08.830" style="s2">say and none of us are actually growing</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.030" end="00:43:11.800" style="s2">and progressing if you&#39;re following</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.830" end="00:43:14.540" style="s2">those rules and so creating small</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.800" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">microbe spaces that are like listen this</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.540" end="00:43:17.450" style="s2">isn&#39;t which is a little weird that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:19.070" style="s2">YouTube or it could you don&#39;t everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.450" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">it could go viral</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.070" end="00:43:24.650" style="s2">yeah but like we can have a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:26.420" style="s2">allows the mistake make sense like game</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.650" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">be to say like listen I&#39;m gonna give you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.420" end="00:43:29.650" style="s2">the benefit of the doubt and not think</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.500" end="00:43:42.020" style="s2">that even if that&#39;s true there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.870" end="00:43:44.090" style="s2">underlining goodness there that we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.020" end="00:43:47.060" style="s2">concentrate on well hopefully you grow</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.090" end="00:43:50.660" style="s2">through whatever the surface level anger</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.060" end="00:43:54.020" style="s2">fear certain like creating micro safe</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.660" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">spaces that aren&#39;t about PC but are</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.020" end="00:43:57.620" style="s2">about you&#39;re allowed to make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:44:01.100" style="s2">and we&#39;re still your bill still be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.620" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">space for you as soon as you said that I</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.600" end="00:44:12.710" style="s2">e-series and that one of the the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.760" end="00:44:15.890" style="s2">that&#39;s in the right in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.710" end="00:44:18.020" style="s2">page is when we got rid of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.890" end="00:44:21.590" style="s2">we got rid of the metaphysics of cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.020" end="00:44:26.180" style="s2">Redemption there it that that is there</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.590" end="00:44:31.160" style="s2">in the PC culture there is no space for</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.180" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">redemption and how do we you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.160" end="00:44:37.880" style="s2">we bring that back of you made a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:41.120" style="s2">you are not excommunicated from the</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.120" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">which you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.590" end="00:44:46.790" style="s2">excommunicated from the tribe in in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:48.680" style="s2">day and age it&#39;s I&#39;m not loved you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.790" end="00:44:50.450" style="s2">it can trigger whatever your deep you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.680" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">know I&#39;m I&#39;m not loved</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.450" end="00:44:54.350" style="s2">I&#39;m not acceptable you know whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.520" end="00:44:56.270" style="s2">whatever your deep wounding is because</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.350" end="00:45:00.200" style="s2">we all got different one no they come</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.270" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">down to a few core ones but that there</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.200" end="00:45:06.950" style="s2">is space for redemption and bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:09.140" style="s2">and I&#39;ma and and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.950" end="00:45:14.180" style="s2">that specific language to me that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.140" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">it&#39;s you know that extending the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.180" end="00:45:20.990" style="s2">that everyone has something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:23.360" style="s2">everyone is redeemable and yeah if if</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.990" end="00:45:25.970" style="s2">somebody&#39;s wrong about something though</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.360" end="00:45:27.140" style="s2">like in order to be redeemed they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:29.509" style="s2">to learn</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.140" end="00:45:32.150" style="s2">their lesson and realize what they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.509" end="00:45:36.680" style="s2">wrong about and what the right answer or</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.150" end="00:45:40.220" style="s2">what a better answer is and we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.680" end="00:45:44.470" style="s2">don&#39;t see that very often so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.220" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">hearing is like there&#39;s this compassion</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.470" end="00:45:50.450" style="s2">in a good sense to like like like let</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:54.619" style="s2">people make mistakes and keep keep them</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.450" end="00:45:57.890" style="s2">in the conversation but this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.619" end="00:46:01.369" style="s2">it&#39;s very challenging and problematic</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.890" end="00:46:04.220" style="s2">for me because there&#39;s so many bad ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.369" end="00:46:07.160" style="s2">that get smuggled in and we might do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.220" end="00:46:12.049" style="s2">ourselves we might smuggle in some Dogma</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.160" end="00:46:14.900" style="s2">and not know it so we need ways to mmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.049" end="00:46:18.769" style="s2">you know call out or call in each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.900" end="00:46:21.279" style="s2">and and correct that information um but</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.769" end="00:46:27.289" style="s2">but did this idea of like redemption or</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.279" end="00:46:31.999" style="s2">something like it like it&#39;s it comes it</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.289" end="00:46:34.549" style="s2">only comes after the the person has sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.999" end="00:46:37.190" style="s2">of done something different to earn that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.549" end="00:46:40.069" style="s2">Redemption right they it&#39;s it&#39;s a verb</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.190" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2">like to redeem yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.069" end="00:46:46.339" style="s2">and so uh I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll draw from one</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">example because it&#39;s because it&#39;s fresh</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.339" end="00:46:51.769" style="s2">in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:54.440" style="s2">actually um somebody posted in in the in</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.769" end="00:46:56.989" style="s2">the Facebook group the other day mmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.440" end="00:47:00.499" style="s2">like what are some book recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.989" end="00:47:02.329" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve read they suggested to I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.499" end="00:47:05.720" style="s2">forget one but the other was a book by</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.329" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">David Brooks and I just made a like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.720" end="00:47:10.539" style="s2">short kind of dismissive comment I</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:14.089" style="s2">wasn&#39;t trying to be rude to the person</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.539" end="00:47:17.779" style="s2">but kind of just dismissive to David</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.089" end="00:47:22.009" style="s2">Brooks I said David Brooks like was you</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.779" end="00:47:24.220" style="s2">know for the Iraq war and you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.009" end="00:47:26.930" style="s2">don&#39;t think ever really II you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.220" end="00:47:29.480" style="s2">deeply learned his mistakes like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.930" end="00:47:31.819" style="s2">still a pretty centrist person you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.480" end="00:47:35.450" style="s2">and so he gets criticized a ton from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.819" end="00:47:37.999" style="s2">left so there&#39;s just this needed context</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.450" end="00:47:39.499" style="s2">right when we when we parsed this new</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.999" end="00:47:41.360" style="s2">information so I looked at his book</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.499" end="00:47:43.160" style="s2">which is it&#39;s a recent book and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.360" end="00:47:47.600" style="s2">kind of autobiographical and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.160" end="00:47:49.970" style="s2">it&#39;s decent but it&#39;s you know it I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.600" end="00:47:52.850" style="s2">David Brooks is still fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.970" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">somebody who deserves critique and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.850" end="00:47:57.800" style="s2">and like I did eventually share like ten</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:48:01.130" style="s2">articles critiquing David Brooks like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.800" end="00:48:02.540" style="s2">look here here it is so you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.130" end="00:48:05.000" style="s2">talk about making mistakes like are we</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.540" end="00:48:06.710" style="s2">talking about like so the person who who</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.000" end="00:48:08.540" style="s2">shared that was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.710" end="00:48:11.360" style="s2">appreciative that we had some new</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.540" end="00:48:14.360" style="s2">information but you know are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.360" end="00:48:16.580" style="s2">about forgiving david brooks because</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.360" end="00:48:18.410" style="s2">he&#39;s making his best effort like is he</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.580" end="00:48:20.270" style="s2">actually helping the cause you know i</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.410" end="00:48:21.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know what did david brooks do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.270" end="00:48:25.460" style="s2">might have just said oh he&#39;s the new</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.860" end="00:48:27.260" style="s2">york times columnist that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.460" end="00:48:28.730" style="s2">his thing and he&#39;s kind of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.260" end="00:48:32.390" style="s2">centrist uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.730" end="00:48:34.630" style="s2">and and he you know the specific example</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.390" end="00:48:37.340" style="s2">i&#39;m using his he supported the Iraq war</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.630" end="00:48:39.980" style="s2">which of course in retrospect was just a</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.340" end="00:48:42.620" style="s2">terrible idea but lots of people at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.980" end="00:48:45.470" style="s2">time were against it and he was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.620" end="00:48:49.400" style="s2">who was for it you know based on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.470" end="00:48:51.740" style="s2">information that he thought he had uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.400" end="00:48:53.840" style="s2">and but it but it&#39;s just generally you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.740" end="00:48:56.360" style="s2">know the thing things people hate about</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.840" end="00:48:59.450" style="s2">him is in the discourse you know he he</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.360" end="00:49:02.780" style="s2">presents himself as this prevent / very</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.450" end="00:49:07.460" style="s2">professional very considered thinker you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.780" end="00:49:09.080" style="s2">know and and more critical people just</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.460" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">see through that like oh he&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.080" end="00:49:18.260" style="s2">apologist for empire at worst right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:21.230" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a paradox here and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.260" end="00:49:23.090" style="s2">we you know try to bring people into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.230" end="00:49:27.560" style="s2">conversation with compassion and let</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.090" end="00:49:30.410" style="s2">that let their let their ideas you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.560" end="00:49:33.860" style="s2">be expressed but then when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.410" end="00:49:36.490" style="s2">about building complex systems and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.860" end="00:49:40.790" style="s2">new ideologies like it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.490" end="00:49:43.430" style="s2">sensitive process it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.790" end="00:49:48.290" style="s2">collective project like we have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.430" end="00:49:50.920" style="s2">of be critical of each other but in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.290" end="00:49:50.920" style="s2">compassionate way</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.230" end="00:49:56.010" style="s2">so I is not good simply won&#39;t gain</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:57.510" style="s2">traction right so people can express</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.010" end="00:49:58.530" style="s2">their odor isn&#39;t there shit ideas they</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.510" end="00:49:59.670" style="s2">just weren&#39;t getting any traction they</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.530" end="00:50:01.970" style="s2">won&#39;t go any further right though</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.670" end="00:50:07.790" style="s2">they&#39;ll be heard in that moment yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.970" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">wish self-regulating at least in theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.790" end="00:50:12.030" style="s2">hopefully with some intelligent people</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:14.339" style="s2">it would be but I think maybe is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.030" end="00:50:15.780" style="s2">space I don&#39;t like the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.339" end="00:50:18.450" style="s2">have to change your behavior before you</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.780" end="00:50:20.579" style="s2">get Redemption can I just pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.450" end="00:50:22.200" style="s2">that because III think grant makes a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.579" end="00:50:24.060" style="s2">really valid point there I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.200" end="00:50:26.369" style="s2">you can be redeemed unless you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.060" end="00:50:29.730" style="s2">the mistake that you&#39;ve made right I</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.369" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">want to make a suggestion because like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.730" end="00:50:34.920" style="s2">child or when you like I have autism and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:37.470" style="s2">so I have met I have breakdowns I got</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.920" end="00:50:42.390" style="s2">like there&#39;s I can&#39;t promise that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.470" end="00:50:44.700" style="s2">gonna happen again my point is is it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.390" end="00:50:45.960" style="s2">the moment I make a mistake I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.700" end="00:50:48.450" style="s2">promise it&#39;s not gonna happen again</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.960" end="00:50:50.790" style="s2">there&#39;s no changing to do there but to</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.450" end="00:50:54.030" style="s2">save the to sit in the shame of oh I</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.790" end="00:50:55.320" style="s2">said something wrong or I acted in a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.030" end="00:50:57.900" style="s2">that they thought was impolite or</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.320" end="00:50:59.550" style="s2">whatever it happens to be the redemption</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.900" end="00:51:02.550" style="s2">part because this is my issue with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.550" end="00:51:04.740" style="s2">of things is that these new cultures</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.550" end="00:51:05.460" style="s2">like yelling at children to apologize to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.740" end="00:51:08.579" style="s2">each other you hit your brother</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.460" end="00:51:09.990" style="s2">apologize it&#39;s not an actual change it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.579" end="00:51:11.609" style="s2">not an actual and so if you first</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.990" end="00:51:15.540" style="s2">require the change in behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.609" end="00:51:17.670" style="s2">opposed to how do we love you where you</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.540" end="00:51:20.280" style="s2">are which is to me the only key to</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.670" end="00:51:22.020" style="s2">redemption is to truly love like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.280" end="00:51:25.020" style="s2">underlining piece right they may be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.020" end="00:51:26.609" style="s2">misogynistic asshole Welcome Table but</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.020" end="00:51:29.130" style="s2">if we can see the humanity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.609" end="00:51:30.630" style="s2">part of the humanity underneath you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.130" end="00:51:32.250" style="s2">don&#39;t need to stop being a misogynist</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.630" end="00:51:34.950" style="s2">asshole to have bought value and worth</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.250" end="00:51:38.119" style="s2">please do but like to have value in</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.950" end="00:51:41.000" style="s2">words yes like how do we still hear the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.119" end="00:51:43.079" style="s2">non-mechanical of all the misogynist</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.000" end="00:51:44.970" style="s2">logic rejection is never required</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.079" end="00:51:46.380" style="s2">because you never require attention</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.970" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">because you&#39;ve never fallen right and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.380" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">redemption is never yea and redemption</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:54.420" style="s2">is irrelevant by it by that rationale</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:55.710" style="s2">redemption doesn&#39;t exist there is no</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.420" end="00:51:57.240" style="s2">possibility of redemption cuz you never</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.710" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">fall you never need it right because you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.240" end="00:52:01.069" style="s2">never because the tribe starts kicking</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:03.019" style="s2">you out right</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.069" end="00:52:04.669" style="s2">you&#39;re still ostracized you still have</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.019" end="00:52:06.410" style="s2">the shame but if they&#39;re not willing to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.669" end="00:52:07.729" style="s2">take you back in until you admit you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.410" end="00:52:10.099" style="s2">were wholly wrong and you&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.729" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">well wait maybe they are still a racist</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.099" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">uh we help them get to less racist</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:18.049" style="s2">you&#39;re wholly wrong is it but if you are</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:20.599" style="s2">to be redeemed certainly in the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.049" end="00:52:22.759" style="s2">others you have to see things through</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.599" end="00:52:25.130" style="s2">the eyes of others and at least accept</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.759" end="00:52:26.719" style="s2">their you you may not agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.130" end="00:52:28.309" style="s2">right you have to at least accept that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.719" end="00:52:30.979" style="s2">their criticism is valid from their</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.309" end="00:52:32.989" style="s2">perspective you say I mean that the very</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.979" end="00:52:36.169" style="s2">minimum redemption has to begin there</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.989" end="00:52:38.419" style="s2">but a recognition that you have harmed</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.169" end="00:52:39.979" style="s2">you have whether or not you intended to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.419" end="00:52:42.049" style="s2">whether or not you agree that you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:52:42.979" end="00:52:47.059" style="s2">acknowledge that you know what I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.469" end="00:52:49.400" style="s2">you if you refuse to even do that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.059" end="00:52:51.140" style="s2">don&#39;t assuming that we accept the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.400" end="00:52:53.269" style="s2">possibility of redemption that you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.140" end="00:52:56.479" style="s2">fall to a point where you need redeeming</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.269" end="00:52:58.219" style="s2">do you know what I mean but yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.479" end="00:53:00.349" style="s2">has to be there has to be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.219" end="00:53:03.589" style="s2">change otherwise how how how is</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.349" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">Redemption possible Ari is to put back</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.589" end="00:53:08.599" style="s2">where it was before right and so I I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:10.130" style="s2">don&#39;t see how without change you can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.599" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">put back to where you were before I</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.130" end="00:53:15.019" style="s2">don&#39;t see that but I do like a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.759" end="00:53:48.619" style="s2">the process like telling people to stop</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.939" end="00:53:51.140" style="s2">being is not the way because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.619" end="00:53:52.579" style="s2">work and so accepting people where they</p>

<p begin="00:53:52.579" end="00:53:55.729" style="s2">love there even if this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.109" end="00:53:58.549" style="s2">shit there - because we&#39;re all fully</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.729" end="00:54:00.650" style="s2">good and bad human beings there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.549" end="00:54:02.179" style="s2">something there that&#39;s like and I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.650" end="00:54:05.150" style="s2">part of it is what Kira said before this</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.179" end="00:54:06.559" style="s2">idea and the person right if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.150" end="00:54:08.630" style="s2">agree with my idea you&#39;re fundamentally</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.630" end="00:54:13.130" style="s2">know I do that all the time and figuring</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.089" end="00:54:15.030" style="s2">that piece out in group right figuring</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.130" end="00:54:16.830" style="s2">it out in safe enough</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.030" end="00:54:18.450" style="s2">groups which means if someone&#39;s being a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.830" end="00:54:20.550" style="s2">racist ousel quite frankly I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.450" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">to be in conversation with them but that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.550" end="00:54:24.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I should put it on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:26.940" style="s2">nobody should be in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.810" end="00:54:28.980" style="s2">them right that all of Twitter should</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.940" end="00:54:31.290" style="s2">stop I&#39;m not even gonna talk to you on</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.980" end="00:54:33.300" style="s2">Twitter if you talk to them right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.290" end="00:54:34.980" style="s2">a whole other level of falling away from</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.300" end="00:54:36.990" style="s2">the tribe where it&#39;s not even that</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.980" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">you&#39;re ostracized from this group I&#39;m an</p>

<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:42.210" style="s2">about taking you in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.840" end="00:54:44.250" style="s2">right which is like someone&#39;s in pain</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.210" end="00:54:46.440" style="s2">they&#39;re acting in a shitty shitty way</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.250" end="00:54:48.360" style="s2">and we inflict more pain on them</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.440" end="00:54:50.850" style="s2">that just doesn&#39;t solve anything and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.360" end="00:54:52.320" style="s2">think taking a step back is how we solve</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.850" end="00:54:54.330" style="s2">it what is the reason they&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.320" end="00:54:57.000" style="s2">shitty thing and how can we love them</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.330" end="00:55:02.580" style="s2">and it makes less shit happen in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.000" end="00:55:07.500" style="s2">hypothesis Brent you had something um</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.580" end="00:55:10.260" style="s2">yeah I was just gonna say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.500" end="00:55:13.290" style="s2">this is awkwardly close to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.260" end="00:55:15.660" style="s2">like Christian forgiveness where like</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.290" end="00:55:18.210" style="s2">you know Christians might just do the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.660" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">thing whatever it may be and then ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.210" end="00:55:22.650" style="s2">for forgiveness right that&#39;s their kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:25.170" style="s2">of method of just continually letting</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.650" end="00:55:27.420" style="s2">themselves off off the hook but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.170" end="00:55:29.700" style="s2">other example I wanted to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.420" end="00:55:31.580" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit related like to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.700" end="00:55:35.310" style="s2">David Brooks thing is there&#39;s this guy</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.580" end="00:55:38.790" style="s2">Peter Dao and he&#39;s like a hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.310" end="00:55:41.660" style="s2">Democrat operative and writer and in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.790" end="00:55:47.000" style="s2">2016 election he was really championing</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.660" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">Hillary Clinton and over the years since</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.000" end="00:55:53.310" style="s2">he&#39;s like experienced like a profound</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:57.810" style="s2">reversal right where he realizes that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.310" end="00:56:01.770" style="s2">like like he was just you know he should</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.810" end="00:56:04.050" style="s2">have supported Bernie more you know more</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.770" end="00:56:06.870" style="s2">in a more committed way and and and not</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.050" end="00:56:08.570" style="s2">like just defaulted to the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.870" end="00:56:10.890" style="s2">camp and so like it&#39;s this complete</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.570" end="00:56:13.710" style="s2">turnaround and change of a person and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.890" end="00:56:15.840" style="s2">back in 2016 everybody did hate this guy</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.710" end="00:56:18.390" style="s2">they completely you know tried to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.840" end="00:56:22.070" style="s2">ostracize him and and just because his</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.390" end="00:56:24.990" style="s2">his tack was so centrist you know so</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.070" end="00:56:27.930" style="s2">what it whatever it was it was just so</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.990" end="00:56:28.800" style="s2">off-putting to the progressive left but</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.930" end="00:56:31.500" style="s2">who he is</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.800" end="00:56:34.590" style="s2">now today it&#39;s like on Twitter he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.500" end="00:56:38.460" style="s2">constantly unpacking like how he was</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.590" end="00:56:40.320" style="s2">wrong and what he learned in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.460" end="00:56:42.570" style="s2">like you&#39;re kind of helping other people</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.320" end="00:56:44.340" style="s2">understand what it what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.570" end="00:56:46.680" style="s2">change in such a profound way and what</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.340" end="00:56:49.830" style="s2">and what it takes to recognize that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.680" end="00:56:53.070" style="s2">were wrong like it&#39;s such like I said at</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.830" end="00:56:55.910" style="s2">the beginning like it&#39;s so rare but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.070" end="00:56:59.430" style="s2">feel when you see it it&#39;s so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.910" end="00:57:01.500" style="s2">and there&#39;s so many people who like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.430" end="00:57:03.570" style="s2">you just see how intransigent they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.500" end="00:57:05.850" style="s2">they just don&#39;t want to change and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.570" end="00:57:08.220" style="s2">like whether it&#39;s their personal belief</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.850" end="00:57:11.130" style="s2">or they&#39;re just you know touting some</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.220" end="00:57:13.140" style="s2">political line it&#39;s just so mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.130" end="00:57:15.090" style="s2">that people don&#39;t change and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.140" end="00:57:17.340" style="s2">this time of great change and flux and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.090" end="00:57:23.400" style="s2">upheaval and they&#39;re you know there has</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.340" end="00:57:28.860" style="s2">to be convergence on new attractors the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.400" end="00:57:30.180" style="s2">the thing that you said about seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.860" end="00:57:31.950" style="s2">people that they don&#39;t want to change</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.180" end="00:57:33.540" style="s2">that&#39;s actually something I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.950" end="00:57:36.270" style="s2">deeply reflecting on because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.540" end="00:57:39.570" style="s2">there are times when I have been accused</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.270" end="00:57:42.770" style="s2">of being stuck that I&#39;m not that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.570" end="00:57:46.110" style="s2">changing when in the reality is there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.770" end="00:57:48.300" style="s2">constant change happening it just may</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.110" end="00:57:50.340" style="s2">not be happening at this rate and speed</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.300" end="00:57:54.330" style="s2">with which the people in my life want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.340" end="00:57:57.840" style="s2">see it happen and there is no and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.330" end="00:58:02.010" style="s2">there is a certain amount and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.840" end="00:58:03.630" style="s2">again right now I&#39;m kind of like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.010" end="00:58:05.220" style="s2">never used religious words and yet they</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.630" end="00:58:09.780" style="s2">seem to be coming up that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.220" end="00:58:13.650" style="s2">grace of yeah it might take me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.780" end="00:58:15.480" style="s2">longer to make the transition because I</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.650" end="00:58:17.130" style="s2">have to let you know I have to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.480" end="00:58:18.930" style="s2">this part of my identity and that part</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.130" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">of my identity many different pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.930" end="00:58:25.260" style="s2">myself in order to come to that app in</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:27.170" style="s2">you know come to that opinion or be able</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.260" end="00:58:30.440" style="s2">to see things from your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.170" end="00:58:33.390" style="s2">there is this underlying assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.440" end="00:58:35.130" style="s2">because someone isn&#39;t willing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.390" end="00:58:38.520" style="s2">acknowledge right now in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.130" end="00:58:42.670" style="s2">that they are wrong that there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.520" end="00:58:45.610" style="s2">some change happening every conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.670" end="00:58:48.250" style="s2">chain with people every you know it it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.610" end="00:58:50.050" style="s2">may not people may dig in and not be and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.250" end="00:58:52.120" style="s2">not change because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.050" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">things like if I give up this opinion</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.120" end="00:58:57.280" style="s2">will I be rejected by my entire family</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">that I you know deeply loved if I change</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.280" end="00:59:02.380" style="s2">if I change this and admit I am wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:05.020" style="s2">does that mean that I am NOT this person</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.380" end="00:59:07.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s all of these very complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.020" end="00:59:09.250" style="s2">things that we make this a so when we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.570" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">make this assumption that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.250" end="00:59:13.750" style="s2">want to change I think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:16.270" style="s2">false premise to start with because</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.750" end="00:59:20.470" style="s2">everyone in every interaction in every</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.270" end="00:59:25.750" style="s2">moment is changing the and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.470" end="00:59:27.850" style="s2">there&#39;s this yeah I don&#39;t know and there</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.750" end="00:59:32.260" style="s2">was the earlier Brent you said something</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.850" end="00:59:34.660" style="s2">about you know a something for being</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.260" end="00:59:38.040" style="s2">able to call out and call in and I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.660" end="00:59:41.770" style="s2">and part of that is people being able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.040" end="00:59:44.530" style="s2">take ownership for their responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.770" end="00:59:47.020" style="s2">their their internal responses to</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.530" end="00:59:49.240" style="s2">something that someone else said you</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.020" end="00:59:53.380" style="s2">said something racist or sexist or</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.240" end="00:59:55.900" style="s2">shitty or whatever and or I can say that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.380" end="00:59:58.330" style="s2">thing that you said brought up a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.900" end="01:00:00.460" style="s2">emotion in me and not identify it as one</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.330" end="01:00:02.170" style="s2">way or the other because and I may be</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.460" end="01:00:05.260" style="s2">able to very clearly see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.170" end="01:00:07.740" style="s2">racist and sexist but if I can bring up</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.260" end="01:00:10.420" style="s2">to the surface that thing that you said</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.740" end="01:00:12.850" style="s2">you know brought up these emotions and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.420" end="01:00:16.390" style="s2">here&#39;s what I you know here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.850" end="01:00:18.550" style="s2">heard you say because it and and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.390" end="01:00:20.650" style="s2">might be because if I just say clearly</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.550" end="01:00:24.420" style="s2">that that&#39;s what you said was racist and</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.650" end="01:00:27.640" style="s2">sexist if I repeat what I heard them say</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.420" end="01:00:32.860" style="s2">maybe that was not at all what they</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.640" end="01:00:35.230" style="s2">intended and maybe and so it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.860" end="01:00:37.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very complicated piece of</p>
