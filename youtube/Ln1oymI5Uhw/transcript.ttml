<p begin="00:01:23.540" end="00:01:29.030" style="s2">would be excommunicated from that group</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.440" end="00:01:58.190" style="s2">some of them some of them are very deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.360" end="00:02:01.700" style="s2">some of them I thought we could play</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.190" end="00:02:03.740" style="s2">with and I wanted to start with Peters</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.700" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">question but I wanted to invite you all</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.740" end="00:02:10.250" style="s2">to help out in a certain way so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:14.739" style="s2">have a pen and paper just take jot down</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.250" end="00:02:17.989" style="s2">some notes so you can do shares and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.739" end="00:02:20.930" style="s2">Peter&#39;s question was how to be strong</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.989" end="00:02:25.959" style="s2">enough to live a full life now when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.930" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">read your questions if they don&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.959" end="00:02:29.569" style="s2">relevant in the way you said it last</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:33.889" style="s2">week you can go</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.569" end="00:02:37.760" style="s2">I didn&#39;t ask it in a different way but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.889" end="00:02:40.519" style="s2">tried to transcribe it pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.760" end="00:02:42.469" style="s2">faithfully okay so Peter asked this</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.519" end="00:02:47.389" style="s2">question how to be strong enough to live</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.469" end="00:02:53.560" style="s2">a full life and if we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.389" end="00:02:58.010" style="s2">like collective insight practice or</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.560" end="00:03:00.709" style="s2">looking semantics Prime&#39;s what do the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.010" end="00:03:04.010" style="s2">words mean or mental models the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.709" end="00:03:07.969" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing or Cohen work we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.010" end="00:03:10.370" style="s2">doing some Cohen work if you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.969" end="00:03:14.599" style="s2">question like this most people would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:18.889" style="s2">attracted or be interested in well what</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.599" end="00:03:23.000" style="s2">is a full life but I want to hone in on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.889" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">this word strong I think that&#39;s strong I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.000" end="00:03:27.949" style="s2">mean obviously they&#39;re coupled together</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:31.790" style="s2">he&#39;s got a mental model of a full life</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.949" end="00:03:35.019" style="s2">and what is it to be strong so this word</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.790" end="00:03:38.180" style="s2">strong is very interesting to me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.019" end="00:03:42.829" style="s2">what I would like the group to do for</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.180" end="00:03:46.430" style="s2">Peter is to create a list of strong like</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.829" end="00:03:52.069" style="s2">what I could say for example strong like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:56.629" style="s2">an ox right or strong like or tornado or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.069" end="00:04:00.379" style="s2">strong like steel and let&#39;s see how many</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.629" end="00:04:07.449" style="s2">we can get in five minutes and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.379" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">we&#39;ll share and people will people will</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.449" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">you know there&#39;ll be some redundancy so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2">just keep going into all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve thought of have been said and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:27.229" style="s2">question is how to be strong enough to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:30.820" style="s2">live a full life strong like what some</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.229" end="00:04:30.820" style="s2">use some powerful metaphors here</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:54.970" style="s2">yeah you could put it in the chat too</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.270" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">and we can read them from the child good</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.970" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.990" end="00:08:51.540" style="s2">okay one more let&#39;s do 45 more seconds</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.310" end="00:08:51.540" style="s2">this is beautiful toddy Brice</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.390" end="00:09:14.190" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.090" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s Peter reflect on this</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.190" end="00:09:27.690" style="s2">first first go-round so what I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:31.620" style="s2">noticing is that the words that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.690" end="00:09:34.170" style="s2">probably would resonate with say in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.620" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">past like mountain or lion or thunder</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.170" end="00:09:42.390" style="s2">just wasn&#39;t landing for me it was sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:53.790" style="s2">of the more unusual ones let&#39;s see like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.390" end="00:10:08.070" style="s2">ants or sunlight yeah a deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.790" end="00:10:10.470" style="s2">choice change yeah and then I just start</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.070" end="00:10:20.010" style="s2">started just witnessing the words come</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.470" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">in after that does anybody want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.010" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">a little bit about some of their one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:30.360" style="s2">their words that really kind of held a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:37.730" style="s2">lot of meaning for them you thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.360" end="00:10:37.730" style="s2">about it speak that Peter</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.259" end="00:10:48.920" style="s2">and you know so yeah strong my change</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.860" end="00:10:50.629" style="s2">was one came to me and nothing you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.920" end="00:10:52.089" style="s2">change is the only constant and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.629" end="00:10:54.769" style="s2">this thing that class it is even though</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.089" end="00:10:56.839" style="s2">it&#39;s thinking we think of some often</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.769" end="00:11:00.019" style="s2">thing of strength is like this unmoving</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.839" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">thing actually yeah everything the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.019" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">person Israel yeah yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">because it for me it was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:16.850" style="s2">you hear strong like you know when a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:18.620" style="s2">tree blowing in the wind it&#39;s responding</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.850" end="00:11:20.749" style="s2">to change but you said strong like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.620" end="00:11:23.629" style="s2">change itself like the force of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.749" end="00:11:28.189" style="s2">mover the force of the movement itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.629" end="00:11:31.540" style="s2">versus was being strong enough to follow</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.189" end="00:11:34.370" style="s2">the movement you can you close that gap</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.540" end="00:11:38.259" style="s2">with with with just putting it like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.370" end="00:11:38.259" style="s2">that was cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.620" end="00:11:53.059" style="s2">mine that was really resonating was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:56.750" style="s2">warrior which I realize is maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.059" end="00:12:01.689" style="s2">little cliche I possibly fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.750" end="00:12:04.309" style="s2">maybe seals Spartans and Vikings they</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.689" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">often puzzle it how drawn amber like</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.309" end="00:12:09.290" style="s2">solar energy but very lunar so maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.480" style="s2">just always looking for the compliment</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.290" end="00:12:15.139" style="s2">mm-hmm not wondering about my femininity</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.480" end="00:12:16.809" style="s2">but like masculinity is Wow but as I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.139" end="00:12:20.180" style="s2">watching the things come through like</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.809" end="00:12:23.000" style="s2">mycelial web like oh my god yes and just</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.180" end="00:12:25.610" style="s2">all the subtleties so it was really</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.000" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">lovely receiving from everyone because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.610" end="00:12:33.350" style="s2">was kind of stuck on my usual</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:35.720" style="s2">fascination like strength this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.350" end="00:12:38.509" style="s2">about the physicality there there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.720" end="00:12:40.459" style="s2">essence running through all these strong</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.509" end="00:12:42.589" style="s2">things that I won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.459" end="00:12:45.740" style="s2">articulate really right now but really</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.589" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">opening up where I can find more</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.740" end="00:12:51.319" style="s2">strength than my experience yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:52.579" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that we could turn that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.319" end="00:12:55.129" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.579" end="00:12:56.809" style="s2">on itself so if you think of all those</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.129" end="00:13:00.799" style="s2">different types of strengths there</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.809" end="00:13:05.720" style="s2">themselves on mycelial web right there</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.799" end="00:13:06.860" style="s2">are interpenetrating all these strengths</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.720" end="00:13:10.309" style="s2">you know all these strengths are</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.860" end="00:13:12.499" style="s2">available because they already exist</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.309" end="00:13:16.999" style="s2">they exist in the universe I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.499" end="00:13:18.589" style="s2">they&#39;re not you know like strong like</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.999" end="00:13:20.540" style="s2">and unicorn you could have said look</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.589" end="00:13:23.509" style="s2">this is more of a fantasy right or a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.540" end="00:13:33.769" style="s2">metaphor but these are things we pointed</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.509" end="00:13:46.009" style="s2">out that actually exists there yeah any</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.769" end="00:13:49.819" style="s2">other share yeah someone put two</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.009" end="00:13:57.319" style="s2">year-olds will to say no I don&#39;t who</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.819" end="00:13:59.899" style="s2">that was but and I and I laughed and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.319" end="00:14:02.509" style="s2">also there was something there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.899" end="00:14:05.419" style="s2">there&#39;s something more there like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.509" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2">wrote an impulse than Alliance and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.419" end="00:14:13.910" style="s2">feel like yeah that if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.980" end="00:14:14.899" style="s2">that you know that that two-year-old you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.910" end="00:14:16.579" style="s2">know they&#39;re saying no but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.899" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">saying yes to something there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.579" end="00:14:22.220" style="s2">something they&#39;re drawn to there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:23.899" style="s2">something that makes sense to them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.220" end="00:14:28.850" style="s2">I mean you know what you know they can</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.899" end="00:14:31.720" style="s2">feel the they dig their heels in for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.850" end="00:14:35.319" style="s2">reason there&#39;s a really good reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.720" end="00:14:35.319" style="s2">something really strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.910" end="00:15:00.040" style="s2">Marion Marion um yeah I noticed I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:15:02.260" style="s2">sort of like oscillating as I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.040" end="00:15:03.820" style="s2">reading each one of these there was kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.260" end="00:15:06.310" style="s2">of like a rock-paper-scissors going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.820" end="00:15:10.090" style="s2">in my head thinking oh yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.310" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">totally strong except that it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.090" end="00:15:14.290" style="s2">thing seems stronger in relation to this</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:16.510" style="s2">one oh but then there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.290" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">that&#39;s stronger in relation and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.510" end="00:15:20.650" style="s2">sort of like picking up on there seemed</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:23.200" style="s2">to be something about things that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:25.480" style="s2">able to affect change like strong things</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.200" end="00:15:27.100" style="s2">were would affect the world very</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">strongly and then there was another</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.100" end="00:15:31.210" style="s2">sense in which some of the strong things</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:34.270" style="s2">were just strong because they resisted</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.210" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">change and so as I was reading through</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.270" end="00:15:37.450" style="s2">all the words I was like does this</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:40.840" style="s2">affect the change or is this resistant</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.450" end="00:15:42.820" style="s2">to a change and in relation to each</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.840" end="00:15:44.110" style="s2">other which one is stronger is there</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.820" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">going to be a change or is there not</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.110" end="00:15:55.870" style="s2">going to be a change yeah that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:58.450" style="s2">think of like it&#39;s not a question of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.870" end="00:16:00.670" style="s2">quantity strength is not a question of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.450" end="00:16:02.950" style="s2">quantity I&#39;m gonna get stronger it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.670" end="00:16:08.710" style="s2">question of skillful means I need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.950" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">strong like in this context and then it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.710" end="00:16:15.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require effort or building it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.010" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">requires picking and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.100" end="00:16:23.260" style="s2">need to be stronger pair of scissors and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:27.220" style="s2">to beat the rock I need to be strong</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.260" end="00:16:32.970" style="s2">like paper and this notion of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.220" end="00:16:41.020" style="s2">fluidity of skillful means rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.970" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">quantity yes isn&#39;t it be that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.020" end="00:16:44.410" style="s2">essence of the movement I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that the purpose the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.410" end="00:16:51.910" style="s2">perseverance and you know what struck me</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.100" end="00:16:55.780" style="s2">about the oscillation</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.910" end="00:16:58.360" style="s2">you know we&#39;re we&#39;re us elation can work</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.780" end="00:17:04.290" style="s2">both ways to your point is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.360" end="00:17:04.290" style="s2">we isolating and maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.770" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">contrasting that with being stuck mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.190" end="00:17:21.430" style="s2">so mine that came up to me when I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.190" end="00:17:25.720" style="s2">watching your question last week was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.430" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">kind of a favorite of mine and that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.720" end="00:17:32.730" style="s2">the octopus you know like the octopus</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">lives under like five hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.730" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">whatever some you know barometric</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:41.770" style="s2">pressure of huge amounts I forget what</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:45.940" style="s2">the unit of measurement is there and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.770" end="00:17:49.300" style="s2">know we we build these these crafts</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.940" end="00:17:51.220" style="s2">these these these diving crafts and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.300" end="00:17:53.650" style="s2">these suits and stuff that have to with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.220" end="00:17:56.800" style="s2">withstand all that pressure but how does</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.650" end="00:18:00.790" style="s2">the octopus with boosting all that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.800" end="00:18:03.490" style="s2">pressure all that water pressure its</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.790" end="00:18:06.670" style="s2">water in water right water can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.490" end="00:18:10.060" style="s2">compressed in water and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.670" end="00:18:12.070" style="s2">of that way of matching what you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.060" end="00:18:17.020" style="s2">matching the environment you&#39;re in earth</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.070" end="00:18:20.560" style="s2">or yeah strong like what and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.020" end="00:18:24.520" style="s2">people humans we have pretty much as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.560" end="00:18:26.380" style="s2">culture a very limited toolkit strong</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.520" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">like what you know it&#39;s always like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.380" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">let&#39;s build a bomb looks like bigger</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">machines to go through that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.780" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">let&#39;s create anti-viral thing to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:42.340" style="s2">know what&#39;s the proper like strength for</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:45.490" style="s2">a covert virus this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.340" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">question it&#39;s probably not the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.490" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">strong we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:19:01.640" style="s2">so I just really loved the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.430" end="00:19:05.450" style="s2">because it really brought out that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.640" end="00:19:13.450" style="s2">inquiry yeah did you want to comment</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.450" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">before we move move on yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.450" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">because what I got where I&#39;m taking away</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:21.380" style="s2">from that is it&#39;s like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:25.010" style="s2">our strength and saying no and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:27.620" style="s2">just strength and saying yes to change</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.010" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">you know things that happen to you and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.620" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">had a bias towards the the know you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:37.070" style="s2">like the mountain you know the lion the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:40.520" style="s2">thing that can resist something and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.070" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">it put some light onto that that bias I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.520" end="00:19:57.650" style="s2">had any last comments something has</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:20:02.930" style="s2">energy for you yes I put when strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.650" end="00:20:05.650" style="s2">like an orgasm and I think about orgasms</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.930" end="00:20:12.550" style="s2">generally being pleasurable I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.650" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">mysterious and can be overtaking and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.550" end="00:20:21.770" style="s2">cause relaxation and yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:25.070" style="s2">something about the coming in and going</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.770" end="00:20:28.910" style="s2">out and coming in and going out and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.070" end="00:20:31.790" style="s2">mind-bending aspect of it that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.910" end="00:20:34.270" style="s2">change people&#39;s perceptions of what they</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.790" end="00:20:37.130" style="s2">want for their lives</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.270" end="00:20:39.260" style="s2">yeah so for me that really tied into</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.130" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">this notion the other part of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.260" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">question of the fulfilled life you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:48.560" style="s2">in when you said strong like orgasm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:56.810" style="s2">more it&#39;s like this the way I relate to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.560" end="00:21:00.230" style="s2">it is continually building the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.810" end="00:21:04.850" style="s2">of the tension to see just you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.230" end="00:21:06.140" style="s2">almost like you know the I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.850" end="00:21:08.540" style="s2">French word for gas</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.140" end="00:21:15.410" style="s2">means little death like really pushing</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.540" end="00:21:18.860" style="s2">the constantly building up the strength</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.410" end="00:21:25.400" style="s2">how much can you how much can you</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.860" end="00:21:27.500" style="s2">contain and for me that had a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.400" end="00:21:29.630" style="s2">with the word fulfill like keep filling</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.500" end="00:21:32.990" style="s2">and filling and filling and filling and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.630" end="00:21:35.540" style="s2">filling and filling until this strength</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.990" end="00:21:39.260" style="s2">expresses itself it goes from tension to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.540" end="00:21:49.970" style="s2">strength so that that was really cancer</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.260" end="00:21:52.310" style="s2">it kind of imagery for me now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.970" end="00:21:57.050" style="s2">interesting because then I just switch</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.310" end="00:22:02.900" style="s2">to a male perspective yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.050" end="00:22:05.030" style="s2">interesting so strong like orgasm when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.900" end="00:22:08.680" style="s2">switch to a male perspective really</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.030" end="00:22:08.680" style="s2">shifted that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.780" end="00:22:20.870" style="s2">can you say more about that for like</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.500" end="00:22:25.460" style="s2">from the female perspective is you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.870" end="00:22:29.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just like being able to absorb more</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.460" end="00:22:32.780" style="s2">and more and more and more more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.260" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">and for the male perspective I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.780" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">know if I can only have a projection</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:44.900" style="s2">really of the male perspective but part</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:53.080" style="s2">of it is could be that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.900" end="00:22:53.080" style="s2">also be part of that kind of movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.430" end="00:23:06.470" style="s2">but it also could be this is such a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:08.120" style="s2">projection okay so so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.470" end="00:23:10.670" style="s2">involved I mean I think that&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.120" end="00:23:14.270" style="s2">from the male perspective but like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.670" end="00:23:17.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have a penis so but I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.270" end="00:23:21.650" style="s2">imagine in my my kind of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.500" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s different it&#39;s kind of like instead</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.650" end="00:23:29.870" style="s2">of it&#39;s instead of being able to absorb</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:35.060" style="s2">more and more it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.870" end="00:23:37.190" style="s2">like not being able to tolerate that so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.060" end="00:23:39.140" style="s2">you know these words aren&#39;t easy because</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.190" end="00:23:45.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t have the first-hand experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.140" end="00:23:48.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s almost like yeah if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.350" end="00:23:52.430" style="s2">can help me out here yeah drive versus</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.710" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">absorption or like they feed off of each</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.430" end="00:23:59.180" style="s2">other you know the more you can absorb</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.710" end="00:24:01.190" style="s2">the more yeah I don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.180" end="00:24:05.260" style="s2">words you know that felt sent shifted</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.190" end="00:24:05.260" style="s2">for me and like I said I can&#39;t release</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.000" end="00:24:12.530" style="s2">yeah I have to get into more of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:16.970" style="s2">projection or empathic projection to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.530" end="00:24:19.250" style="s2">think of it from the other side and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.970" end="00:24:21.320" style="s2">just in from a from a genderqueer</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.250" end="00:24:23.270" style="s2">perspective thinking about all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.320" end="00:24:26.090" style="s2">different kinds of orgasms that I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.270" end="00:24:27.330" style="s2">like there are some like yesterday I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.090" end="00:24:28.570" style="s2">listening to too</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.330" end="00:24:31.130" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.570" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">talk and connect on a really deep level</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.130" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">and it was just like waves of pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:40.190" style="s2">through my body and also like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:43.280" style="s2">relating that I have with plants</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.190" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">sometimes and it&#39;s there is I really</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.280" end="00:24:47.000" style="s2">liked what you said about the building</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:49.370" style="s2">up and how much more can you maintain</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.000" end="00:24:51.230" style="s2">how much work in you contain and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.370" end="00:24:55.250" style="s2">feels like that like walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.230" end="00:24:56.780" style="s2">street smelling roses there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.250" end="00:25:01.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s this building of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.780" end="00:25:04.010" style="s2">capacity for appreciation yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.940" end="00:25:07.280" style="s2">this is a funny image I&#39;m gonna spoil</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.010" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">all that all the heat here but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.280" end="00:25:13.010" style="s2">this like video series like about</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:15.650" style="s2">different kinds of strange love like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:21.260" style="s2">people love machines and stuff and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.650" end="00:25:23.390" style="s2">quite often that men will marry or</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.260" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">partner with really fat women and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.390" end="00:25:30.560" style="s2">become their feeders it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:32.930" style="s2">projection of that you know they feed</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.560" end="00:25:37.250" style="s2">and feed and feed and have you seen</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.930" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">those it&#39;s really really quite odd and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.250" end="00:25:43.880" style="s2">you know the men have the women on</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:45.920" style="s2">strict routines and they want to get up</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.880" end="00:25:49.040" style="s2">for like 8 or 9 pounds but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.920" end="00:25:53.030" style="s2">like displacement of that that same kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.040" end="00:25:55.700" style="s2">of kind of the feeders yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.030" end="00:25:59.630" style="s2">archetypal of those it&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.700" end="00:26:01.880" style="s2">just thought about it it&#39;s okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.630" end="00:26:03.620" style="s2">well first of all it&#39;s fun talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.880" end="00:26:08.450" style="s2">orgasms just now it&#39;s got me thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.620" end="00:26:11.480" style="s2">okay I did this exploration where I</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.450" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">guess I can have multiples and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.480" end="00:26:16.250" style="s2">the most I&#39;ve ever had in a row just by</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:18.410" style="s2">myself there&#39;s like eight lady and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.250" end="00:26:20.630" style="s2">really started looking at it he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.410" end="00:26:23.480" style="s2">totally detached from any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.630" end="00:26:25.850" style="s2">sexuality in a way there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.480" end="00:26:28.280" style="s2">about the opposite sex and I just kept</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.850" end="00:26:30.770" style="s2">looking at that like peak moment and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.280" end="00:26:32.930" style="s2">like what is it what is it doing to my</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.770" end="00:26:36.020" style="s2">body and it was just like a little bell</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.930" end="00:26:39.230" style="s2">I could hit I&#39;d be like the very center</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.020" end="00:26:40.460" style="s2">of some kind of fractal spiral so I did</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.230" end="00:26:44.810" style="s2">some meditating on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.460" end="00:26:46.850" style="s2">it was I was just abstinent as far as</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.810" end="00:26:50.900" style="s2">interacting with others for four years</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.850" end="00:26:53.870" style="s2">recently and I started having my orgasms</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.900" end="00:26:56.360" style="s2">to of an image of a swirling purple</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.870" end="00:26:59.150" style="s2">galaxy I couldn&#39;t get enough of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.360" end="00:27:01.400" style="s2">like star cluster and I would experiment</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.150" end="00:27:03.620" style="s2">sort of midway I&#39;d be like let&#39;s throw</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.400" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">like some male genitalia in here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:09.950" style="s2">let&#39;s get some human human action in</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:13.430" style="s2">here and it was just completely I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.950" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">get back to that galaxy and so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.430" end="00:27:18.500" style="s2">a bigger discussion maybe but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:21.260" style="s2">something about the orgasm that almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.500" end="00:27:22.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t sexual it&#39;s I mean it is I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.260" end="00:27:24.650" style="s2">make it sexual</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.160" end="00:27:27.380" style="s2">but there&#39;s something just so primal</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.650" end="00:27:38.090" style="s2">about it but transcends all of the form</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.380" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve never said that anyone remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.090" end="00:27:40.280" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:42.770" style="s2">you&#39;re in the earlier we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.280" end="00:27:49.190" style="s2">the effects and then we didn&#39;t we left</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.770" end="00:27:54.410" style="s2">left aside well we&#39;re really young</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.190" end="00:27:58.700" style="s2">we can&#39;t regulate our own ethics like we</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.410" end="00:28:00.310" style="s2">need we need a primary caregiver then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.700" end="00:28:02.270" style="s2">go off to school we have peer groups</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.310" end="00:28:04.400" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to help us with our</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:07.210" style="s2">anxiety we learn to regulate our own</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.400" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">assets and it&#39;s the same with lust</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.210" end="00:28:16.700" style="s2">when we first alerting we need a dyad in</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">general but you can regulate your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.700" end="00:28:23.410" style="s2">orgasmic system or experience it or</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:26.450" style="s2">follow its rhythm or catalyze it without</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.410" end="00:28:32.290" style="s2">another person this is this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.450" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">clear and you don&#39;t even have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.290" end="00:28:38.660" style="s2">by touching yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:39.980" style="s2">imaginative Tantra is really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.660" end="00:28:43.220" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.980" end="00:28:49.130" style="s2">your you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.220" end="00:28:52.730" style="s2">and so yeah I actually think like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.130" end="00:28:54.330" style="s2">said the more imaginative the more space</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.730" end="00:28:56.250" style="s2">the more</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.330" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">you know people used to call it muse</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.250" end="00:29:04.470" style="s2">you&#39;re visited by a muse because yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">then the question is what are organisms</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.470" end="00:29:19.650" style="s2">for you know why is that evolved in us</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:23.790" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s also true for other</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.650" end="00:29:25.290" style="s2">animals you see male and female cats</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.790" end="00:29:33.270" style="s2">especially when they&#39;re sleeping and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.290" end="00:29:37.680" style="s2">dreaming and they have like so it turns</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.270" end="00:29:45.630" style="s2">out that this is yeah another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.680" end="00:29:47.790" style="s2">seamless with the continuity of life you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.630" end="00:29:50.370" style="s2">know in the in the chi gong we called</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.790" end="00:29:53.730" style="s2">the microcosmic orbit you&#39;re these</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.370" end="00:29:55.950" style="s2">energies are building up within between</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.730" end="00:29:57.750" style="s2">you the heaven and the earth and in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.950" end="00:29:59.100" style="s2">body so they&#39;re still heaven on earth</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.750" end="00:30:02.280" style="s2">they&#39;re still masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.100" end="00:30:13.170" style="s2">principle but the orbits happening this</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.280" end="00:30:17.340" style="s2">way versus versus that way Peter did you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.170" end="00:30:26.790" style="s2">want to comment on that this is your</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.340" end="00:30:28.800" style="s2">question no no comments coming up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.790" end="00:30:36.540" style="s2">so this is good this is just a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.800" end="00:30:39.240" style="s2">way of showing how that these questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.540" end="00:30:43.050" style="s2">you know when they&#39;re asked when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.240" end="00:30:45.540" style="s2">asked authentically they&#39;re like little</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.050" end="00:30:47.780" style="s2">portals into all kinds of all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.540" end="00:30:47.780" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.880" end="00:31:01.830" style="s2">okay can we move on should we move on so</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.030" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">Donna is Donna here asked is this Donna</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.830" end="00:31:06.600" style="s2">did you ask I didn&#39;t put down your last</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">name so how do we measure community</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.600" end="00:31:10.059" style="s2">house and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:13.270" style="s2">digital space yes that was my question</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.059" end="00:31:17.559" style="s2">okay this was a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.270" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">question and so I wanted to back down</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.559" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">and say how do we measure communitas in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:30.760" style="s2">originally like how do we just and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:34.059" style="s2">ask how do we measure it in digital</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.760" end="00:31:37.780" style="s2">space no I actually had a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.059" end="00:31:39.670" style="s2">download answer in this question that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.780" end="00:31:44.020" style="s2">thought I would share but then open it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.670" end="00:31:49.000" style="s2">up to discussion because I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.020" end="00:31:50.679" style="s2">done research in this with Dave Snowden</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.000" end="00:31:52.840" style="s2">sense-making technology you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.679" end="00:31:58.620" style="s2">design a scan and then you see the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.840" end="00:32:01.870" style="s2">results on high school students and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.620" end="00:32:05.140" style="s2">adapted it for communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.870" end="00:32:08.650" style="s2">doing a collaborative housing mutual</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.140" end="00:32:16.360" style="s2">stake holding property building and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.650" end="00:32:18.190" style="s2">stuff like that and it turns out that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.360" end="00:32:21.910" style="s2">you want to think of it as the protocols</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.190" end="00:32:24.809" style="s2">that that code for communities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.910" end="00:32:31.960" style="s2">three major ones and that&#39;s belonging</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.809" end="00:32:33.400" style="s2">voice and meaning we showed with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.960" end="00:32:35.410" style="s2">research and I&#39;ll get to what those are</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.400" end="00:32:38.440" style="s2">but we show with the research research</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.410" end="00:32:42.670" style="s2">that people that had higher or more</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.440" end="00:32:45.370" style="s2">complex understanding or ways of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.670" end="00:32:48.520" style="s2">belonging voice it meaning reported</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.370" end="00:32:50.200" style="s2">larger kin group size how many people</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.929" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">make meaning if these things were were</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.150" end="00:33:09.520" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:13.570" style="s2">not complex we call them one deep too</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.520" end="00:33:16.330" style="s2">deep in 3d you would report having one</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.570" end="00:33:19.960" style="s2">or two or no close friends and if they</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.330" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">were complex he was report having more</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.960" end="00:33:25.070" style="s2">than 10</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:34.340" style="s2">let&#39;s say so and what we mean by these</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.070" end="00:33:36.890" style="s2">is meaning is basically in this group am</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.340" end="00:33:39.140" style="s2">I am I able to participate with what</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.890" end="00:33:41.270" style="s2">matters most to me like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.140" end="00:33:43.190" style="s2">matter to me do the things we do they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.270" end="00:33:47.059" style="s2">the things we talk about are they</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.190" end="00:33:48.710" style="s2">relevant to what matters most to me you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.059" end="00:33:50.090" style="s2">know sometimes we participate in groups</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.710" end="00:33:51.559" style="s2">and we&#39;re happy to do that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.090" end="00:33:53.960" style="s2">accompanying our mother but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.559" end="00:33:55.160" style="s2">really going on is like bingo it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.960" end="00:33:59.660" style="s2">really matter to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.160" end="00:34:01.400" style="s2">so meaning is all about whether the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.660" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">interactions the engagement the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.400" end="00:34:05.720" style="s2">participation is what matters to you and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:07.970" style="s2">that could be terrific</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.720" end="00:34:11.210" style="s2">what we you know it&#39;s not trivial like</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.970" end="00:34:13.940" style="s2">some people like baseball and and soccer</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.210" end="00:34:16.250" style="s2">and football really matter to you so</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.940" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not a highfalutin thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.250" end="00:34:26.510" style="s2">it&#39;s very context relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:30.409" style="s2">context you&#39;re in so so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.510" end="00:34:33.290" style="s2">one leg of building communities the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.409" end="00:34:35.149" style="s2">second thing is and you see this across</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.290" end="00:34:36.830" style="s2">all different levels you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.149" end="00:34:39.530" style="s2">have like cheerleaders or high school</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:41.450" style="s2">kids or girls that are really into</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.530" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">makeup and stuff and dresses and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.450" end="00:34:47.270" style="s2">shopping it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">know what form it takes it just matters</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.270" end="00:34:52.190" style="s2">if the participation and the engagement</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:58.850" style="s2">how you spend your time is what matters</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.190" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">most to you the second thing is voice do</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.850" end="00:35:05.750" style="s2">you have can you always take you do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:08.750" style="s2">have I always given a turn to say what</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.750" end="00:35:11.090" style="s2">you have to say when you when you want</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.750" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">to say do you or do you feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.090" end="00:35:14.900" style="s2">can never get in or something so how</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2">much your voice do you have so not only</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.900" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">can you have your take your turn but</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.750" end="00:35:23.690" style="s2">does what you say change the direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:26.930" style="s2">or the choices so it has to be coupled</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.690" end="00:35:31.540" style="s2">to consequences and the third thing in</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.930" end="00:35:34.040" style="s2">voice is can you say something without</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.540" end="00:35:36.110" style="s2">feeling like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.040" end="00:35:39.470" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say it when you&#39;re a minority</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.110" end="00:35:42.350" style="s2">position so those are the three ways you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.470" end="00:35:48.380" style="s2">can get in in terms of voice what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.350" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">call voice so meaning and voice and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.380" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">third one is belonging and belonging is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:57.860" style="s2">a little harder to describe because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.730" end="00:36:01.570" style="s2">it&#39;s different than identity like or</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.860" end="00:36:05.230" style="s2">affiliation and what belonging means is</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.570" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">has to do with a specific self other</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.230" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">relationship in the group do I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:13.730" style="s2">I am in the group both I&#39;m in the group</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:17.300" style="s2">and the group is in me like that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.730" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">group but the group is a manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.300" end="00:36:27.380" style="s2">of me and I&#39;m a manifestation of a group</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:31.730" style="s2">so we try to get get get to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.380" end="00:36:34.580" style="s2">of if someone just feels like I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.730" end="00:36:37.130" style="s2">group well that&#39;s a lower level of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.580" end="00:36:40.010" style="s2">belonging but if they feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.130" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">group is nothing without me too you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.010" end="00:36:45.980" style="s2">then this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:53.330" style="s2">interpenetration so these are the three</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.980" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">protocols for for communitas that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.330" end="00:36:59.600" style="s2">we have shown are correlated they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:04.610" style="s2">causal but they&#39;re correlated to how how</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.600" end="00:37:09.620" style="s2">larger a kin group you have so I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.610" end="00:37:11.410" style="s2">that they might be transferable to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.620" end="00:37:16.070" style="s2">digital space</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.410" end="00:37:18.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just that how we make sure like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.070" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2">think turn-taking is hard in the distant</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.080" end="00:37:21.380" style="s2">digital space because you can&#39;t like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.910" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">have two screens here you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.380" end="00:37:25.250" style="s2">sometimes I don&#39;t even know someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">starts talking and I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.250" end="00:37:30.590" style="s2">who&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:33.410" style="s2">regular participatory spaces it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.590" end="00:37:35.120" style="s2">clear you can you know you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.410" end="00:37:38.330" style="s2">feel this person hasn&#39;t said anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.120" end="00:37:40.250" style="s2">but you can&#39;t feel an energy but then in</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.330" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">real space you feel like this person you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.250" end="00:37:45.530" style="s2">can like sense it you&#39;re like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.680" end="00:37:49.000" style="s2">know something wants to come up here I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.530" end="00:37:49.000" style="s2">find that very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:58.670" style="s2">yeah that study is is is not available</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.010" end="00:38:01.370" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.670" end="00:38:08.810" style="s2">it&#39;s its own but it&#39;s a work that I did</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.370" end="00:38:11.000" style="s2">for foundation so it&#39;s this it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.810" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">onto a much larger scale with these</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.000" end="00:38:16.490" style="s2">community building and if it holds true</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:22.130" style="s2">for that then we&#39;ll probably publish a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.490" end="00:38:24.410" style="s2">white paper one of the problems is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.130" end="00:38:29.270" style="s2">Dave Snowden&#39;s work and it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.410" end="00:38:38.660" style="s2">very statistically robust so as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.270" end="00:38:42.140" style="s2">to okay I have a question yeah so can</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.660" end="00:38:44.570" style="s2">you contrast that to sense-making I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.140" end="00:38:47.180" style="s2">assuming that meaning-making and since</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.570" end="00:38:49.130" style="s2">making is two different things</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.180" end="00:38:58.360" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re two different things so</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.130" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">since making is kind of a collective a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.360" end="00:39:03.710" style="s2">collective activity so you all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:07.610" style="s2">understand each other and you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.710" end="00:39:09.830" style="s2">language that is translatable and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.610" end="00:39:11.540" style="s2">have theories of change or theories of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.830" end="00:39:13.460" style="s2">models of what&#39;s happening that you all</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.540" end="00:39:17.380" style="s2">agree with you&#39;re following the same map</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.460" end="00:39:21.260" style="s2">it made sense of your shared experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.380" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">you can share a lot of meaning with</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.260" end="00:39:25.580" style="s2">someone like let&#39;s say you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:27.500" style="s2">partner and you have children right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.580" end="00:39:29.120" style="s2">you&#39;re always engaged in like what</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.500" end="00:39:31.160" style="s2">school are they going to go to and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.120" end="00:39:33.020" style="s2">or that and like when you&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.160" end="00:39:35.390" style="s2">with them it means a lot to you but</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.020" end="00:39:37.130" style="s2">maybe your partner wants them to go to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">public school because they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.130" end="00:39:40.370" style="s2">them to be like elitist and you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:42.890" style="s2">them to Montessori because you want them</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.370" end="00:39:45.860" style="s2">to be like a new human and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.890" end="00:39:48.290" style="s2">engaged in what matters most to you but</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.860" end="00:39:50.120" style="s2">you can&#39;t come to any like sense make</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.290" end="00:39:54.700" style="s2">you can&#39;t make it&#39;s no difficult like</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.120" end="00:39:57.770" style="s2">sense around these two points of view</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.700" end="00:39:59.660" style="s2">because it depends upon your theory of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.770" end="00:40:01.670" style="s2">the human your theory of culture your</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.660" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">theory of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.670" end="00:40:06.920" style="s2">in the world so the sense-making is</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:09.890" style="s2">breaking down even as people are trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.920" end="00:40:11.510" style="s2">the very they&#39;re working very meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.890" end="00:40:16.099" style="s2">participation with each other is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.510" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">helpful absolutely in fact it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.099" end="00:40:22.970" style="s2">brings a question to mine is why why</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:30.950" style="s2">Buddhists why they didn&#39;t choose since</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.970" end="00:40:33.650" style="s2">making no study was to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.950" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">what correlated with Kings pen group</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.650" end="00:40:44.089" style="s2">size that&#39;s an interesting question at</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:51.740" style="s2">what point does I can say that how is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.089" end="00:40:55.790" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember so I&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.740" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">it but the question is does the erosion</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.790" end="00:41:00.500" style="s2">of sense-making break down your akin</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.930" style="s2">group size what&#39;s the correlation with</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.500" end="00:41:06.859" style="s2">that that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.930" end="00:41:09.859" style="s2">you know one of the reasons why we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.859" end="00:41:13.490" style="s2">doing this is to make a case that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.859" end="00:41:16.520" style="s2">can ground kinship</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.490" end="00:41:21.650" style="s2">I believe and we didn&#39;t further this</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.520" end="00:41:23.270" style="s2">study but I believe that the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.650" end="00:41:26.839" style="s2">that people have to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.270" end="00:41:31.450" style="s2">sense together to feel like they belong</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.839" end="00:41:35.960" style="s2">together is a very very modern thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.450" end="00:41:38.930" style="s2">when I was growing up I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.960" end="00:41:41.599" style="s2">friends were who was around and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.930" end="00:41:44.059" style="s2">didn&#39;t like test the semantics what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:45.410" style="s2">know like we&#39;re all hung up on words you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.059" end="00:41:48.250" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want to use this word in</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.410" end="00:41:50.900" style="s2">that word and we&#39;re constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.250" end="00:41:53.089" style="s2">make sense in these kind of completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.900" end="00:41:56.329" style="s2">identical ways in order to feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.089" end="00:41:59.030" style="s2">belong this is certainly did not exist</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.329" end="00:42:01.670" style="s2">before the little linguistic turn where</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.030" end="00:42:07.390" style="s2">words and semantics lighting and all</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.670" end="00:42:11.960" style="s2">this mattered more so this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.390" end="00:42:15.290" style="s2">research - you know David Graeber who</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.960" end="00:42:18.230" style="s2">wrote Det he&#39;s an anarchist he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.290" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">really I don&#39;t forget which book but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.230" end="00:42:22.580" style="s2">know he&#39;s like it&#39;s ridiculous to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:25.370" style="s2">that you have to have shared values and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.580" end="00:42:29.120" style="s2">shared models of reality to get along</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.370" end="00:42:31.700" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.120" end="00:42:36.260" style="s2">what that&#39;s not appealing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.700" end="00:42:39.410" style="s2">consistent with the human condition so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.260" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">think this is that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.410" end="00:42:43.310" style="s2">the reasons well I don&#39;t engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:48.070" style="s2">media space and the war on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.310" end="00:42:48.070" style="s2">I think the one sense-making is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.030" end="00:42:53.720" style="s2">amplifying the war on sense making if</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.980" end="00:42:56.600" style="s2">you say you know words are weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.720" end="00:43:02.030" style="s2">well you&#39;ve just weaponized the word the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.600" end="00:43:03.320" style="s2">word word and there&#39;s yes so this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.030" end="00:43:07.730" style="s2">probably not true in other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.320" end="00:43:10.070" style="s2">right yeah you can&#39;t understand you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.730" end="00:43:12.350" style="s2">travel other cultures you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.070" end="00:43:15.800" style="s2">understand and you can laugh you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.350" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">understand why the family relations are</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.800" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">the way they die and the food they eat</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:26.180" style="s2">and the crazy things you do but because</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:28.460" style="s2">you have let go of you know because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.180" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">gap is so wide no one expects you to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.460" end="00:43:37.100" style="s2">understand and therefore you can touch</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:40.810" style="s2">base with with how you can ground each</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.100" end="00:43:45.260" style="s2">other and somehow you know our whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.810" end="00:43:48.710" style="s2">late modern and postmodern deficient</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.260" end="00:43:52.570" style="s2">modern world is everything is about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.710" end="00:43:59.750" style="s2">words in the models and getting it right</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.570" end="00:44:03.500" style="s2">and the information we share there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.750" end="00:44:05.510" style="s2">illusion that things held together in</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.500" end="00:44:07.850" style="s2">the past because we all agreed on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.510" end="00:44:10.730" style="s2">same thing in the past we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.850" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">that nobody actually thought what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.730" end="00:44:19.460" style="s2">thought you know the diversity of human</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:26.950" style="s2">experience is under underrated and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.460" end="00:44:26.950" style="s2">need for people to yes so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.030" end="00:44:34.070" style="s2">and then there&#39;s other cool things about</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.830" end="00:44:36.940" style="s2">sense-making you could put a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.070" end="00:44:40.730" style="s2">of it in my article on the side view</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.940" end="00:44:47.570" style="s2">people that study since making like Carl</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.730" end="00:44:49.640" style="s2">like it turns out it&#39;s it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.570" end="00:44:54.740" style="s2">than we think of it also is making us</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.640" end="00:44:57.320" style="s2">retrospective sounds making and they and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:45:01.099" style="s2">in my article I tell the story of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.320" end="00:45:05.270" style="s2">Hungarian it&#39;s funny because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.099" end="00:45:09.710" style="s2">Hungarian the new polish joke right</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.270" end="00:45:13.700" style="s2">so this Hungarian military squad was on</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.710" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">was in Switzerland doing you know these</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.700" end="00:45:21.140" style="s2">military exercises and they were sent</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:23.300" style="s2">out into the Alps and they got caught in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.140" end="00:45:28.690" style="s2">a freak snowstorm like happens sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.300" end="00:45:31.130" style="s2">and they got lost from a whiteout and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.690" end="00:45:32.599" style="s2">there were three days that you were</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.130" end="00:45:34.550" style="s2">panicking and they didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.599" end="00:45:37.190" style="s2">find their way back and they thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.550" end="00:45:39.560" style="s2">they were going to die because they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.190" end="00:45:42.859" style="s2">unprepared for the that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.560" end="00:45:45.400" style="s2">weather and on the third day they found</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.859" end="00:45:51.320" style="s2">their way back to camp and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.400" end="00:45:53.060" style="s2">lieutenant who had sent them out was was</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.320" end="00:45:54.830" style="s2">how did you get back and they said well</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.060" end="00:45:59.060" style="s2">we thought we were dead but on the third</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.830" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">day this this other guy found an old map</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.060" end="00:46:04.760" style="s2">he had in his pocket and that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:06.650" style="s2">were able to find our way home and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.760" end="00:46:08.810" style="s2">give him the map and it turned out the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:12.020" style="s2">map wasn&#39;t a map of the Alps it was the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.810" end="00:46:14.050" style="s2">map of the Pyrenees oh what time is</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.020" end="00:46:14.050" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.150" end="00:46:30.360" style="s2">and so since making is a is a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.990" end="00:46:35.550" style="s2">thing we do it&#39;s not actually rational</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.360" end="00:46:38.730" style="s2">and now I have to run for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.550" end="00:46:41.720" style="s2">because I told him I was on a call until</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.730" end="00:46:45.900" style="s2">11:00 he woke up at 11:15 he&#39;s here now</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.720" end="00:46:47.550" style="s2">already but if you bear with me I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.900" end="00:46:50.610" style="s2">get him started I&#39;d like to do one more</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.550" end="00:46:54.200" style="s2">question before we end but I&#39;ll be right</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.610" end="00:46:54.200" style="s2">back sorry</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.150" end="00:47:01.210" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.780" end="00:47:25.060" style="s2">all kind of coming together because</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.250" end="00:47:27.670" style="s2">we&#39;re seeking to understand versus you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.060" end="00:47:29.940" style="s2">know the communities that are seeking or</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.670" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">people who are seeking to get along and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.940" end="00:47:36.990" style="s2">what kind of showed up for me was you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:40.150" style="s2">know is wow yeah that&#39;s kind of where</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.990" end="00:47:51.850" style="s2">society is shifting away from being that</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.850" end="00:47:56.470" style="s2">into this yeah well we just have to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.520" end="00:47:59.080" style="s2">along so if we you know we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.470" end="00:48:02.460" style="s2">cause conflict so is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.080" end="00:48:02.460" style="s2">resonating with anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.049" end="00:48:10.109" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.410" end="00:48:24.630" style="s2">I think that that getting a long part</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.859" end="00:48:26.340" style="s2">gets to the context of my question</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.630" end="00:48:28.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.340" end="00:48:30.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.920" end="00:48:33.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a choice that we have to be here</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:41.010" style="s2">what we talked about here if this seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:44.850" style="s2">relevant then I can participate and I</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.820" end="00:49:09.510" style="s2">of the life of a community and so my my</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.230" end="00:49:13.320" style="s2">question is is around that and I and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:49:17.370" end="00:49:22.670" style="s2">really articulate way but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.050" end="00:49:26.940" style="s2">something about a physical community</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.670" end="00:49:29.670" style="s2">where that life extends the life is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.940" end="00:49:33.750" style="s2">can you can sense your interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.670" end="00:49:38.370" style="s2">part of it that&#39;s beyond choice</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.750" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">and then in in a digital community</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.370" end="00:49:50.500" style="s2">choice is very important and how far</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:54.300" style="s2">does this interconnectedness extend and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.500" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">how deep does it reach in each of us and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.300" end="00:50:03.360" style="s2">and how do we measure that and and can</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:07.830" style="s2">we hope to experience that</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.470" end="00:50:35.710" style="s2">context do you see any distinction</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.490" end="00:50:37.570" style="s2">between choice and commitment well if I</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.290" end="00:50:51.940" style="s2">physical group of people I&#39;m kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">know I&#39;ve kind of cut off a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.940" end="00:50:56.770" style="s2">choices like well I used up all my money</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:58.990" style="s2">I quit my job I am now a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.770" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">I&#39;m totally invested in the life of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.990" end="00:51:02.930" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:05.360" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.930" end="00:51:09.620" style="s2">but there&#39;s still a lot of choices</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.360" end="00:51:13.190" style="s2">available to me in a digital space that</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.620" end="00:51:14.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to you know cut off or say</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.190" end="00:51:18.230" style="s2">no to just to be a part of a digital</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.840" end="00:51:20.120" style="s2">space so how deep is that level of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.230" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">community and community AHS even though</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.120" end="00:51:24.650" style="s2">we experienced communitas how deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">really deep is that level of commitment</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.650" end="00:51:31.870" style="s2">to each other just it&#39;s a good I like</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:31.870" style="s2">the way you put you posed that question</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.710" end="00:51:44.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll add to this Thank You Donna I</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.210" end="00:51:47.420" style="s2">feel like the like digital community is</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.680" end="00:51:50.210" style="s2">still not very well understood in some</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.420" end="00:51:52.820" style="s2">ways so things that we took for granted</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.210" end="00:51:54.280" style="s2">with physical community like proximity</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.820" end="00:51:56.990" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.280" end="00:51:59.780" style="s2">when you join a community physically</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.990" end="00:52:01.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a you can&#39;t leave in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.780" end="00:52:05.420" style="s2">mean you can leave but you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.700" end="00:52:08.450" style="s2">physically leave so you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.420" end="00:52:12.200" style="s2">meaning and voice and belonging all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.450" end="00:52:15.269" style="s2">those seem like they are not limited by</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.200" end="00:52:18.149" style="s2">the physical space but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.269" end="00:52:21.659" style="s2">it makes me wonder what the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.149" end="00:52:24.140" style="s2">proximity and physicality is and like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.659" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">how that translates to the digital world</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.140" end="00:52:29.190" style="s2">and I have kind of a weird analogy came</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">to mind which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.190" end="00:52:35.010" style="s2">you know crypto currencies and Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:36.329" style="s2">is forcing us to understand money in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.010" end="00:52:40.560" style="s2">new way because it&#39;s money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.329" end="00:52:43.980" style="s2">decoupled from the traditional mediums</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.560" end="00:52:46.170" style="s2">of exchange the physicality of that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.980" end="00:52:48.930" style="s2">so in a way community has we have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.170" end="00:52:51.180" style="s2">same challenge of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.930" end="00:52:53.780" style="s2">community decoupled from physical</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.180" end="00:52:53.780" style="s2">proximity</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.060" end="00:53:02.980" style="s2">and would you say that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.830" end="00:53:06.670" style="s2">value of you to use that analogy you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.980" end="00:53:12.510" style="s2">know the value of Bitcoin is somewhat of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.670" end="00:53:20.070" style="s2">the collective commitment it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.510" end="00:53:22.360" style="s2">people saying in yeah that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.070" end="00:53:26.070" style="s2">there has to be some kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.360" end="00:53:30.070" style="s2">consensus or any sense making system to</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.070" end="00:53:32.320" style="s2">hold up yeah but curious what other</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.070" end="00:53:48.340" style="s2">people think or there&#39;s any other</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.320" end="00:53:51.460" style="s2">thoughts floating around I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.340" end="00:53:55.060" style="s2">most of the very original thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.460" end="00:53:57.310" style="s2">ideas come completely out of social</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.060" end="00:54:00.100" style="s2">consensus they&#39;re completely contrarian</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.310" end="00:54:11.110" style="s2">and they require and mention of a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.100" end="00:54:14.710" style="s2">world and even terminology altogether um</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.110" end="00:54:18.310" style="s2">if I can riff on that I might suggest</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.710" end="00:54:20.740" style="s2">that to be contrary you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.310" end="00:54:22.690" style="s2">some consensus to be responding to or</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.740" end="00:54:28.540" style="s2">reacting against so maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.690" end="00:54:31.590" style="s2">dialectic relationship there yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.540" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">like there&#39;s a default assumption right</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.590" end="00:54:37.420" style="s2">he&#39;s based on my deep dive in investing</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:41.770" style="s2">worried there&#39;s a default assumption</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.420" end="00:54:44.290" style="s2">that contrarian ism is sort of shaking</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.770" end="00:54:46.210" style="s2">the opposite stance but that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.290" end="00:54:50.590" style="s2">something that appears from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.210" end="00:54:52.900" style="s2">I often find that from the inside when</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.590" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">you are thinking purely independently</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.900" end="00:54:56.890" style="s2">and you come up with an insight it might</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.700" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">be aligned or it might be opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.890" end="00:55:01.390" style="s2">consensus and that when it is opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:03.940" style="s2">the consensus from the outside it looks</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.390" end="00:55:06.430" style="s2">as contrarian but from the inside the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.940" end="00:55:08.230" style="s2">person&#39;s conceptualized a new model of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.430" end="00:55:12.250" style="s2">reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.230" end="00:55:15.640" style="s2">away there&#39;s this fascinating article on</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.250" end="00:55:19.240" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember with okay it was not a</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.640" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">yawn or Croat but maybe I could find it</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.240" end="00:55:27.400" style="s2">I have someone posted it and they talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">about sheep and they say sheep the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.400" end="00:55:32.500" style="s2">difference between sheep in wolves and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:34.750" style="s2">liked it because it kind of reframed and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.500" end="00:55:35.790" style="s2">she said sheep they don&#39;t follow the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.750" end="00:55:38.770" style="s2">leader</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.790" end="00:55:41.140" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a social structure where</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.770" end="00:55:42.609" style="s2">there&#39;s a leader what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.140" end="00:55:45.550" style="s2">follow each other they&#39;re more like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.609" end="00:55:47.800" style="s2">swarm of locusts so you have all these</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.550" end="00:55:49.780" style="s2">like if this net one next to me rules</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.800" end="00:55:52.869" style="s2">that way I moved that way and this one</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.780" end="00:55:54.910" style="s2">move that way they flock right so they</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.869" end="00:55:57.160" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have a social system</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.910" end="00:56:00.130" style="s2">where you follow anything like one</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.160" end="00:56:03.100" style="s2">leader so they&#39;re not like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.130" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">like that kind of social system they</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.100" end="00:56:08.080" style="s2">they care what everybody else thinks</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:10.810" style="s2">what everybody else does</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.080" end="00:56:13.150" style="s2">they&#39;re always adjudicating like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.810" end="00:56:15.910" style="s2">next the next relationship and she was</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.150" end="00:56:18.850" style="s2">saying this was actually the way we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.910" end="00:56:21.609" style="s2">sheep today we actually don&#39;t do what</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.850" end="00:56:25.240" style="s2">president tells us to do but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.609" end="00:56:27.369" style="s2">momentum some momentum gains gains and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.240" end="00:56:30.100" style="s2">then we are afraid of being ostracized</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.369" end="00:56:36.130" style="s2">and then little by little the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.100" end="00:56:41.560" style="s2">conforms based upon this logic of social</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.130" end="00:56:44.260" style="s2">cohesion and and then but she says</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.560" end="00:56:46.540" style="s2">unlike wolves they don&#39;t just obey a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.260" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">leader they&#39;re all leaders and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.540" end="00:56:50.950" style="s2">leadership is constantly very</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:54.150" style="s2">sophisticated social relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.950" end="00:56:57.400" style="s2">between roles and leadership sand</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.150" end="00:56:58.750" style="s2">debating you know if you see dogs more</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.400" end="00:57:00.369" style="s2">months to go here and the other wants to</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.750" end="00:57:02.320" style="s2">go there and there&#39;s like debates and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.369" end="00:57:05.140" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot more going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.320" end="00:57:09.400" style="s2">not just authoritarianism there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.140" end="00:57:14.230" style="s2">just the alpha alpha alpha dog and so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.400" end="00:57:16.750" style="s2">think in our modern society I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.230" end="00:57:18.820" style="s2">we&#39;re more like sheep in that first that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.750" end="00:57:21.560" style="s2">sense that she said you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.820" end="00:57:24.380" style="s2">whole things happen in</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.560" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">our culture because people just are</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.380" end="00:57:28.430" style="s2">unconscious they don&#39;t like follow</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:32.600" style="s2">anything that you don&#39;t have consensus</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.430" end="00:57:36.410" style="s2">they just kind of move like like these</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.600" end="00:57:38.120" style="s2">small actions if you ask people why they</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.410" end="00:57:39.980" style="s2">do things there&#39;s no consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.120" end="00:57:42.410" style="s2">behind it I think it&#39;s more like just</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.980" end="00:57:44.810" style="s2">kind of bodies and space moving with</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.410" end="00:57:48.080" style="s2">other bodies in space</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.810" end="00:57:50.330" style="s2">you you you walk into an environment</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.080" end="00:57:52.340" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice your body starts moving</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.330" end="00:57:55.430" style="s2">like other people&#39;s bodies and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.340" end="00:57:58.070" style="s2">intuitively start picking up the social</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.430" end="00:58:02.270" style="s2">cues and you start replicating them this</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.070" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">is all unconscious very unconscious you</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.270" end="00:58:06.290" style="s2">may feel like you&#39;re doing sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:14.210" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s really something more</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.290" end="00:58:17.330" style="s2">organic then and so what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.210" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">role of the contrarian is to break that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.330" end="00:58:25.070" style="s2">habit is to like you know wake people up</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:26.570" style="s2">what choice are you making here I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.070" end="00:58:27.800" style="s2">give you a really extreme example I</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.570" end="00:58:29.930" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say this but my mother will</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.800" end="00:58:33.230" style="s2">never see this you know my mother was</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.930" end="00:58:36.470" style="s2">born in there a rural area in Maine</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.230" end="00:58:38.150" style="s2">Maine is still very backwards she grew</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.470" end="00:58:41.120" style="s2">up in a one-room schoolhouse they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.150" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">have running water until she was 13 and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.120" end="00:58:49.340" style="s2">she really wanted out of there so she</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.760" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">got a job punching holes in like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.340" end="00:58:54.350" style="s2">original computers were key punch holes</p>
