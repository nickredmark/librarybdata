<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:11.540" style="s2">me you&#39;re a writer with for many places</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">including New York Times Magazine</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.540" end="00:00:17.220" style="s2">Harper&#39;s and you&#39;ve also written a book</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:19.160" style="s2">called unlearning race and I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:22.949" style="s2">talk to you about kind of the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.160" end="00:00:25.109" style="s2">cultural situation and also I think may</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.949" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">be the place to start is the unlearning</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.109" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">race now while you&#39;ve got books like</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:33.590" style="s2">white fragility at the top of the charts</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">and how to be an anti-racist seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.590" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">countercultural almost or it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">not the current understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">the where the discussion is at right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:46.289" style="s2">what are you making of the the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">kind of situation the current situation</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.289" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">is a complicated one on the one hand it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">is heartening to see such interest being</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">paid to questions of how race is</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:02.489" style="s2">constructed how it&#39;s enforced imposed</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">how it governs our lives in our society</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">this is all to the good but as you point</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">out the main books the texts that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">being quoted and cited everywhere are</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">texts that I do take issue with because</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">they in many ways Rhian scribe ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:24.830" style="s2">racial essentialism that my book is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">arguing I guess and that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.830" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">get the conversation to look past so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">have a book like white fragility by</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">Robyn D&#39;Angelo which is the big</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">bestseller right now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">problematic in certain ways because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">it presents white people as an</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">undifferentiated mass not as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">with agency and it presents blacks in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:52.579" style="s2">way that&#39;s quite troubling to me as kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:55.259" style="s2">of like an undifferentiated mass of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.579" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">people who are fundamentally oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">and can only ever react to the real</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">agents of history who are or whites who</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">are also paradoxically not individuals</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">and then on the other hand you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">eeprom candy and some others who you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">know they make very persuasive and good</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:15.299" style="s2">calls for Franta racism but</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:17.459" style="s2">kind of enforce another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.299" end="00:02:18.989" style="s2">essentialism that sees people as</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.459" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">fundamentally black and fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.989" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">white and my argument is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:29.579" style="s2">necessarily at odds with candies how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:31.709" style="s2">be in an anti-racist but it doesn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.579" end="00:02:33.239" style="s2">at the notion that you have to be an</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.709" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">anti-racist and I think we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.239" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">two things at the same time we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">on the one hand fight racism which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">real which governs our lives but we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:44.219" style="s2">have to always keep our eye on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.340" style="s2">ultimate objective which would be to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.219" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">away with the categories of race that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.340" end="00:02:51.569" style="s2">racism imposes I start from the premise</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">that racism creates race and not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.569" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">other way around yeah I think as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.700" style="s2">saying like you have to balance these</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:02.069" style="s2">things at the same time that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:04.829" style="s2">a very difficult conversation to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.069" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">right now because it&#39;s very nuanced for</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.829" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">example Brett Weinstein put out a piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:12.269" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:15.510" style="s2">he&#39;s an evolutionary biologist and said</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.269" end="00:03:17.389" style="s2">that talking about race is very can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.510" end="00:03:19.319" style="s2">very dangerous because it essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.389" end="00:03:22.919" style="s2">triggers some very deep evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.319" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">drives it enforces tribalism so how can</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.919" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">you have that conversation while at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">same time recognizing that there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:31.409" style="s2">deep-rooted inequality there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:33.269" style="s2">legacies of oppression and holding that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.409" end="00:03:34.909" style="s2">both of those at the same time but not</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.269" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">reimposing kind of these essential</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.909" end="00:03:39.540" style="s2">categories but that feels like a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:41.909" style="s2">delicate balancing act it is quite a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.540" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">delicate balancing balancing act and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.909" end="00:03:46.199" style="s2">think that part of the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">seeing now is that not everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.199" end="00:03:51.419" style="s2">necessarily interested in making the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.599" style="s2">effort to balance so part of what has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.419" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">happen is that people have to come as</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.599" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">good faith interlocutors into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.220" end="00:04:01.769" style="s2">exchange there is quite you know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:03.269" style="s2">I&#39;m not I wouldn&#39;t say that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.769" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">out there but it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.269" end="00:04:08.280" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of less of an appetite for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:11.759" style="s2">that now than there was certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.280" end="00:04:14.189" style="s2">2008 when the nation seemed to be like</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.759" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">in a good faith way fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.189" end="00:04:21.269" style="s2">inspired by the idea that maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">transcend this kind of historical sin</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.269" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">that defines our country and of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:26.680" style="s2">you know that kind of euphoria was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.229" style="s2">short-lived</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.680" end="00:04:31.570" style="s2">we soon saw the limits of the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.229" end="00:04:34.449" style="s2">victory of having a mixed-race black man</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.570" end="00:04:37.180" style="s2">the foot mixed racing quotes at the helm</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.449" end="00:04:39.780" style="s2">of the government and now it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.180" end="00:04:42.009" style="s2">the the disappointment was such that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.780" end="00:04:45.070" style="s2">there&#39;s less and less of a generosity</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.009" end="00:04:47.830" style="s2">and willingness for people even on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.070" end="00:04:50.350" style="s2">left to to give up these categories I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.830" end="00:04:51.669" style="s2">feel like oftentimes it&#39;s a very lonely</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.350" end="00:04:53.740" style="s2">place to be saying that the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.669" end="00:04:54.970" style="s2">goal still has to be to transcend racial</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.740" end="00:04:57.419" style="s2">categories because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.970" end="00:04:59.349" style="s2">biologically exist in meaningful ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.419" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not something that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.349" end="00:05:02.289" style="s2">agrees with anymore and I remember very</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:03.699" style="s2">well in 2008 that would be something</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.289" end="00:05:07.419" style="s2">that people would say why is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.699" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">ultimate goal so it&#39;s tricky and not you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.419" end="00:05:12.729" style="s2">know and some of it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:16.539" style="s2">fact that they&#39;re making inroads people</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.729" end="00:05:18.699" style="s2">are making progress by reunifying these</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.539" end="00:05:21.720" style="s2">categories by by doubling down on them</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.699" end="00:05:24.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s working it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.720" end="00:05:26.650" style="s2">it&#39;s getting people to concede quite a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.430" end="00:05:28.300" style="s2">lot so it&#39;s tough to tell people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.650" end="00:05:30.099" style="s2">this thing that&#39;s working in a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.300" end="00:05:32.440" style="s2">sense is something that doesn&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.099" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">a philosophical or maybe even moral or</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.440" end="00:05:36.849" style="s2">ethical sense and you should actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.940" end="00:05:39.479" style="s2">give it up all might have long-term</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.849" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">consequences that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.479" end="00:05:45.849" style="s2">dangerous victories and gains might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.419" end="00:05:48.070" style="s2">Pyrrhic in nature yeah I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.849" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">your journey through this but how did</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.070" end="00:05:51.580" style="s2">you become particularly interested and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">how where have you ended up in your kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.580" end="00:06:00.159" style="s2">of explorations of this topic so my</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:06:02.470" style="s2">journey on race has always been somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.159" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">out of the mainstream because I&#39;m 39</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.470" end="00:06:08.530" style="s2">years old I was born in 1981 I&#39;m the son</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:10.090" style="s2">of a black man from the segregated south</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.530" end="00:06:12.370" style="s2">my father&#39;s actually from Galveston</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.090" end="00:06:13.479" style="s2">Texas it&#39;s June 19th today which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.370" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">Juneteenth</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.479" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">which is the traditional holiday because</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:22.599" style="s2">slaves in Galveston were free at about</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">two years after everybody else and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.599" end="00:06:26.380" style="s2">when they got the news that they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:28.870" style="s2">freed they ran into the streets and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.380" end="00:06:30.550" style="s2">rejoice that&#39;s Juneteenth so my father</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.870" end="00:06:34.990" style="s2">comes from that world he was born in</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.090" end="00:07:37.960" style="s2">the question is often what are your</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.850" style="s2">suddenly thrust when I guess I would</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.520" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">be a different race than your child or</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.770" end="00:09:11.480" style="s2">that you can be a different race than</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.480" end="00:09:16.190" style="s2">there I just saw if I can have a</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:19.790" style="s2">even mean for me to be a black man and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.960" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">what does it mean for her to be walking</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.790" end="00:09:24.110" style="s2">into the world presumed to be white if</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">she can be directly descended from black</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.110" end="00:09:28.190" style="s2">slaves so then that began began the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:29.900" style="s2">process of what became the book</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.190" end="00:09:32.360" style="s2">self-portrait in black and white I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:34.700" style="s2">learning race yeah I I wonder whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.360" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">it&#39;s also a generational thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.700" end="00:09:40.940" style="s2">because I I was brought up by very</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">racially aware anti-racist left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.940" end="00:09:47.029" style="s2">parents and I can remember back then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:48.980" style="s2">confused like I I don&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.980" end="00:09:56.300" style="s2">because it seems that for example I</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.740" end="00:09:58.459" style="s2">remember being brought up and being told</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.300" end="00:10:01.850" style="s2">why the word colored was no longer</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.459" end="00:10:03.470" style="s2">okayed in the 1980s and now we&#39;ve kind</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.470" end="00:10:08.120" style="s2">of color seems to be the accepted</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.810" end="00:10:10.330" style="s2">definition and I remembered like even as</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.120" end="00:10:12.500" style="s2">a even an eight or nine or ten year old</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.330" end="00:10:13.850" style="s2">understanding or at least understood I</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.500" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">thought I understood at the time that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.850" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">was inherently other ring to have a word</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">that sort of meant them an ass and now</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">suddenly we&#39;ve ended up in this place</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:28.850" style="s2">where there seems to be another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2">I I&#39;m confused and I think a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">myself feel very yeah I&#39;m sure and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.450" end="00:10:43.339" style="s2">and quite scared in some ways to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">certain things now because they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.339" end="00:10:48.110" style="s2">certain it seems that that there is a</p>

<p begin="00:10:55.490" end="00:11:00.920" style="s2">understand is kind of being anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.459" end="00:11:04.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the accepted wisdom but it had</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.920" end="00:11:06.050" style="s2">accepted accepted wisdom is also rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.400" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">shifting all the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.050" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly having to rearrange</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:12.170" style="s2">the way you think about language and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:16.250" style="s2">way you think about referring to other</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.250" end="00:11:20.750" style="s2">term that really bothers me on several</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.310" end="00:11:23.959" style="s2">levels first of all it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.750" end="00:11:25.790" style="s2">on precise nine-tenths of the world or</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.959" end="00:11:28.430" style="s2">more fits into that definition because</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.790" end="00:11:31.880" style="s2">only a tiny fraction of humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.430" end="00:11:33.890" style="s2">European or European descended and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.880" end="00:11:38.170" style="s2">seems to take this nine-tenths of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.890" end="00:11:40.670" style="s2">humanity and define them like solely</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:03.410" style="s2">a kind of back door right back into</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:10.370" style="s2">still it separates people into whites</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.399" end="00:12:12.829" style="s2">and non-whites and the relation is one</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.370" end="00:12:14.360" style="s2">of domination and hierarchy and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.829" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get past but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.360" end="00:12:20.390" style="s2">language itself the terms are shifting I</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:22.940" style="s2">mean just this week the conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.390" end="00:12:24.920" style="s2">about now more and more publications</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.940" end="00:12:27.579" style="s2">will be pub will be capitalizing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.920" end="00:12:30.140" style="s2">letter B and black but will not be</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.579" end="00:12:32.329" style="s2">capitalizing white so every group will</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.990" end="00:12:41.510" style="s2">still the center of everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.930" end="00:12:43.640" style="s2">drama and story yeah that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.510" end="00:12:45.380" style="s2">default in some way yes I&#39;ve seen even</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.640" end="00:12:50.060" style="s2">in the last two weeks a lot of friends</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.380" end="00:12:53.120" style="s2">on Facebook for example posting POC pot</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.060" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">and asking questions like does anyone</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:02.420" style="s2">and it&#39;s for me that feels incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.899" end="00:13:05.269" style="s2">dehumanizing so to see this language</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.420" end="00:13:08.089" style="s2">come in full force in the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.269" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">weeks in a way that for me feels deep I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.089" end="00:13:11.720" style="s2">would never use it because I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">is dehumanizing to call someone a POC</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.720" end="00:13:18.770" style="s2">for me is is really I don&#39;t know I&#39;m in</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.950" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">fact is that everybody actually can</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.750" end="00:22:41.990" style="s2">basically do things except for except</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:44.900" style="s2">for again white people white people</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.990" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">can&#39;t because there&#39;s some understood</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:52.040" style="s2">other people&#39;s stories so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.540" end="00:22:53.960" style="s2">what we have to do and what&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.040" end="00:22:57.080" style="s2">to do is just have principles and values</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.960" end="00:22:58.970" style="s2">that apply equally to everybody and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.080" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">have these kind of cabinets that always</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.970" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2">try to seek to address in very imprecise</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:06.560" style="s2">ways historical power imbalances because</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:08.630" style="s2">the problem with this type of correction</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.560" end="00:23:10.790" style="s2">is that we see all too often were over</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.630" end="00:23:13.010" style="s2">correcting in ways that invite</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.790" end="00:23:14.540" style="s2">unforeseen consequences and that make it</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.010" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">impossible to talk to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.540" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2">understand each other hmm I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:21.800" style="s2">wanted to return to what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:24.110" style="s2">about hip-hop culture because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.800" end="00:23:27.050" style="s2">what I love about most death I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.110" end="00:23:28.370" style="s2">remember his in he&#39;s got a song called</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.050" end="00:23:31.850" style="s2">hip hop that I think is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.370" end="00:23:33.590" style="s2">greatest love kind of letters to the art</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.850" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">and he says in that hip hop is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.590" end="00:23:38.300" style="s2">prosecution evidence and out-of-court</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:41.000" style="s2">settlement ad space for liquor which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.300" end="00:23:42.770" style="s2">so so hip hop is also critical of itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.000" end="00:23:46.130" style="s2">like the greatest hip hop is also self</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.770" end="00:23:47.570" style="s2">reflective and critical and and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.130" end="00:23:49.490" style="s2">other side of it as well that I find</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.570" end="00:23:51.470" style="s2">very disconcerting with the current a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.490" end="00:23:55.070" style="s2">lot of the current dynamics is that it</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.470" end="00:23:57.860" style="s2">makes an another most death line where</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.070" end="00:23:59.960" style="s2">he talks about Invisible Man got the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.860" end="00:24:02.450" style="s2">whole world watching like a black</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.960" end="00:24:04.250" style="s2">culture has been probably the driving</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.450" end="00:24:06.950" style="s2">force of American culture and American</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.250" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">from Elvis Presley onwards and how much</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.950" end="00:24:14.060" style="s2">it&#39;s been kind of yeah how much it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:17.000" style="s2">appropriated by by by white artists as</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.060" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">well but but it&#39;s so intertwined with</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.000" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">with how we think of America and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:23.450" style="s2">driving force of America probably one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:26.090" style="s2">the the main driving forces of America</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.450" end="00:24:30.289" style="s2">and what seems very disturbing about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.090" end="00:24:33.950" style="s2">and framing of only seeing black people</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.289" end="00:24:37.299" style="s2">as as victims seems to exclude that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.950" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">actually like there&#39;s so much to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.299" end="00:24:47.330" style="s2">inspired by proud of and amazed by in in</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.330" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s the kind of black southern</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.430" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">society you know a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.050" end="00:26:59.930" style="s2">innocence and I never won a better</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:01.640" style="s2">aspire to that so I I have a tough time</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.640" end="00:27:06.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that some of the insights</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.700" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">into human life and nature that coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.950" end="00:27:12.140" style="s2">up in a black tradition exposed me to I</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.490" style="s2">don&#39;t think of it as being as lacking</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.140" end="00:27:17.690" style="s2">and privileged in fact I think of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.490" end="00:27:19.910" style="s2">as something that&#39;s helped me grow to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.690" end="00:27:23.950" style="s2">almost the age of 40 in a way that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.910" end="00:27:26.630" style="s2">proud of and and how do you hold that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.950" end="00:27:28.850" style="s2">tension because you your books called</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.630" end="00:27:31.310" style="s2">unlearning race but you&#39;re we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.850" end="00:27:33.230" style="s2">talking about the value of black culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.310" end="00:27:36.410" style="s2">black America is a distinct thing in</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.230" end="00:27:38.810" style="s2">itself this is there not a paradox there</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.410" end="00:27:40.910" style="s2">I don&#39;t think so I think that if you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.810" end="00:27:44.210" style="s2">vary and a lot of people when they when</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.910" end="00:27:46.460" style="s2">sometimes I give talks and I see that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.210" end="00:27:50.030" style="s2">some people in the audience who define</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.460" end="00:27:51.620" style="s2">themselves as black they they&#39;re open to</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.620" end="00:27:56.420" style="s2">hurts a little bit to think of severing</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.960" end="00:27:58.790" style="s2">ties with a group of people they want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.420" end="00:28:00.590" style="s2">express solidarity with which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.790" end="00:28:03.290" style="s2">something completely understandable but</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.590" end="00:28:04.250" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very different to say race</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.290" end="00:28:06.260" style="s2">isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.250" end="00:28:07.610" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing about blood and skin</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.260" end="00:28:09.530" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.610" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">about belonging to a community of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.530" end="00:28:16.280" style="s2">a tradition a certain region regionalism</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:18.410" style="s2">matters you know being black in America</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.280" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">is not the same as being quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.410" end="00:28:23.690" style="s2">black in Jamaica or you know anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.640" style="s2">else so you can belong to these people</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.690" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">but we also have to find different ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.640" end="00:28:30.920" style="s2">of belonging to people who don&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:32.990" style="s2">from this community or a tradition we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.920" end="00:28:34.690" style="s2">have to rethink what makes us Americans</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.990" end="00:28:37.010" style="s2">what makes us humans what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:41.870" style="s2">citizens of the 21st century I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.010" end="00:28:44.300" style="s2">that holding on to blackness as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.870" end="00:28:46.070" style="s2">culture is it is as healthy as holding</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.300" end="00:28:48.110" style="s2">on to Italian this is a culture a Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.070" end="00:28:51.620" style="s2">this isn&#39;t as a religion and a culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.110" end="00:28:52.730" style="s2">but it but we&#39;re all and it almost gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.620" end="00:28:54.620" style="s2">to the point where people would laugh at</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.730" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">you for pointing this out but what we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.620" end="00:28:57.980" style="s2">are is were members of the human race I</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:28:59.330" style="s2">mean you have to have both a more</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.980" end="00:29:01.040" style="s2">general understanding of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.330" end="00:29:03.170" style="s2">we&#39;re just members of the human race and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.040" end="00:29:05.570" style="s2">a much more specific understanding of</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.350" end="00:29:20.390" style="s2">people come from but before that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.230" end="00:29:23.000" style="s2">came from another place I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.390" end="00:29:24.740" style="s2">a big it is it&#39;s actually hard to ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.000" end="00:29:27.490" style="s2">people to speak about themselves this</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.740" end="00:29:30.620" style="s2">way because we want these kind of easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.490" end="00:29:33.650" style="s2">monolithic color labels to slap on to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.620" end="00:29:35.210" style="s2">extremely diverse experiences and just</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.650" end="00:29:36.980" style="s2">to make it easy for us to categorize</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.210" end="00:29:39.140" style="s2">ourselves but I think that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.980" end="00:29:41.390" style="s2">achieve a perspective that goes beyond</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.140" end="00:29:42.679" style="s2">that if we&#39;re ever gonna get past this</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.390" end="00:29:48.980" style="s2">kind of balkanized</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.679" end="00:29:50.330" style="s2">debate that&#39;s paralyzing our society but</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.980" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">when I was sort of doing a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.330" end="00:29:54.800" style="s2">research before this conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:56.990" style="s2">read an article in The New York Review</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.800" end="00:29:59.290" style="s2">of Books where you were put together</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.990" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">with I think people like Glenn Lowry</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.290" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">John Atwater and described it as black</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:07.340" style="s2">conservatives which didn&#39;t seem which</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:13.059" style="s2">which didn&#39;t seem right I&#39;ll get your</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.340" end="00:30:14.679" style="s2">reaction to that right like the AVL a.rb</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.059" end="00:30:19.010" style="s2">what do you make of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.679" end="00:30:22.040" style="s2">characterization I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s lazy</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.010" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">it it bothers me because I defined</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.040" end="00:30:28.190" style="s2">myself as a liberal have always</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:31.030" style="s2">certainly voted that way find no home in</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.190" end="00:30:35.000" style="s2">the Republican Party whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.030" end="00:30:36.500" style="s2">perhaps if the writer was implying that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.000" end="00:30:40.970" style="s2">there are elements of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.500" end="00:30:43.100" style="s2">conservatism and in there maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.970" end="00:30:47.470" style="s2">the case maybe maybe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.100" end="00:30:50.420" style="s2">I guess maybe yeah if conserving</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.470" end="00:30:52.580" style="s2">elements of the past makes sense maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.420" end="00:30:53.929" style="s2">he was implying that we&#39;re conservative</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.580" end="00:30:55.900" style="s2">in the way that Ralph Ellison can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.929" end="00:30:58.330" style="s2">called conservative conservative</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.900" end="00:31:01.190" style="s2">personality or something like this but</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.330" end="00:31:03.890" style="s2">it&#39;s also kind of slanderous and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.190" end="00:31:04.519" style="s2">used as an epithet when when another by</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.890" end="00:31:05.779" style="s2">writer</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.519" end="00:31:08.269" style="s2">you&#39;re conservative if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.779" end="00:31:12.369" style="s2">identify that way it&#39;s a way of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.269" end="00:31:15.830" style="s2">jet amaizing any kind of heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.369" end="00:31:18.889" style="s2">aspects of your views that that don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.830" end="00:31:20.809" style="s2">with the kind of woke left or good</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.889" end="00:31:23.959" style="s2">orthodoxy that carries the day right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.809" end="00:31:26.269" style="s2">so yeah it bothers me quite a bit and as</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.959" end="00:31:28.459" style="s2">far as I&#39;m aware John McWhorter Coleman</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.269" end="00:31:31.879" style="s2">Hughes Glenn Lowry any of those guys</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.459" end="00:31:34.249" style="s2">that I routinely get lumped with none of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.879" end="00:31:36.589" style="s2">them defined themselves as conservative</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.249" end="00:31:39.529" style="s2">I think only Glenn Lowry did in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.589" end="00:31:41.899" style="s2">but he since you know he redefined</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.529" end="00:31:44.149" style="s2">himself so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.899" end="00:31:45.649" style="s2">something that you know it&#39;s a label</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.149" end="00:31:50.029" style="s2">that I reject and I try to argue back</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.649" end="00:31:52.669" style="s2">against yeah I mean I was struck like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.029" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">it struck me as very odd I mean it was I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.669" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">would describe you all as heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:58.579" style="s2">thinkers but certainly not conservative</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:00.889" style="s2">and it felt like a way of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.579" end="00:32:03.229" style="s2">policing the conversation in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.889" end="00:32:05.570" style="s2">what views are allowed within kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.229" end="00:32:08.509" style="s2">liberal the liberal world and which are</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.570" end="00:32:11.209" style="s2">not and I find that really really</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.509" end="00:32:13.639" style="s2">interesting as a phenomenon because</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.209" end="00:32:16.879" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of paradox that only</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.639" end="00:32:20.119" style="s2">one particular perspective is allowed if</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.879" end="00:32:22.700" style="s2">you&#39;re from a certain minority group and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.119" end="00:32:27.259" style="s2">that that seems essentialist at its core</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.700" end="00:32:29.209" style="s2">that the sort of paradox of that seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.259" end="00:32:32.450" style="s2">incredibly dehumanizing and a real</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.209" end="00:32:34.849" style="s2">paradox of of the way that the left can</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.450" end="00:32:38.509" style="s2">think about race at times yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.849" end="00:32:40.489" style="s2">not just other so-called blacks who will</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.509" end="00:32:42.649" style="s2">level that at you if you look I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.489" end="00:32:45.559" style="s2">know I mean the new cycle moves so fast</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.649" end="00:32:50.479" style="s2">but recently Joe Biden in an interview</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.559" end="00:32:54.019" style="s2">with a black interlocutor made an</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.479" end="00:32:56.029" style="s2">off-the-cuff remark like the interviewer</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.019" end="00:32:58.009" style="s2">was asking him for more time to asked</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.029" end="00:32:59.419" style="s2">and more questions to go back to his</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.009" end="00:33:00.979" style="s2">community with to make the case for</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.419" end="00:33:03.589" style="s2">voting for Joe Biden and Joe Biden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.979" end="00:33:05.869" style="s2">response was well you just tell them if</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.589" end="00:33:08.089" style="s2">you gotta make up your mind about</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.869" end="00:33:12.200" style="s2">whether for me or the other guy you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.089" end="00:33:13.669" style="s2">ain&#39;t really black it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.200" end="00:33:15.649" style="s2">mind-blowing it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.669" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">patronizing and it kind of treats</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.649" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">yeah it treats</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:22.570" style="s2">it makes an essential Azamat of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:22.570" style="s2">should actually be</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.080" end="00:33:26.890" style="s2">something far more complicated of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.240" end="00:33:28.450" style="s2">I understand that like yeah most black</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.890" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">nine out of ten black people won&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.450" end="00:33:32.800" style="s2">vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden I</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:35.680" style="s2">certainly won&#39;t even after he said that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.800" end="00:33:38.500" style="s2">but the idea that you must think a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.680" end="00:33:40.900" style="s2">certain way in order to be authentically</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.500" end="00:33:44.260" style="s2">yourself as a member of this community</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.900" end="00:33:46.600" style="s2">is really I think it&#39;s destructive but</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.260" end="00:33:48.840" style="s2">it&#39;s also concerning that on the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.600" end="00:33:52.630" style="s2">side you have people like Candice Owens</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.840" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">using that as a as a way of divide being</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.630" end="00:33:57.400" style="s2">more divisive like that that in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:34:01.000" style="s2">ways is far more concerning when you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.400" end="00:34:02.620" style="s2">that kind of that that truth kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.000" end="00:34:06.070" style="s2">weaponized on the other side is in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.620" end="00:34:07.540" style="s2">very divisive way you mean Kenda so in</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.070" end="00:34:10.050" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s just sabotaging the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.540" end="00:34:13.000" style="s2">conversation for her own personal game</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.050" end="00:34:15.220" style="s2">yeah I mean I see her being very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.000" end="00:34:16.899" style="s2">divisive I mean she&#39;s she has elements</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.220" end="00:34:18.640" style="s2">of truth in some of what she&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.899" end="00:34:23.460" style="s2">but she&#39;s using in a very political</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.640" end="00:34:26.200" style="s2">politically charged way to to argue for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.460" end="00:34:28.270" style="s2">black people to vote Trump to vote</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.200" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">Republican well yeah I just don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.270" end="00:34:33.250" style="s2">someone like Candace Owens as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:35.889" style="s2">good-faith conversation partner so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.250" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">think that it is very important to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.889" end="00:34:39.779" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.539" style="s2">I think it&#39;s important to think through</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.779" end="00:34:45.809" style="s2">who is actually coming into the debate</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.539" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">in a good-faith way and so something</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.809" end="00:34:49.349" style="s2">like canvas Owens is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2">non-starter she&#39;s done so much that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.349" end="00:34:54.510" style="s2">sensational it&#39;s kind of a non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.270" end="00:34:57.109" style="s2">but to dismiss someone like who we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.510" end="00:34:59.430" style="s2">been talking about like Glander or John</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.109" end="00:35:02.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not authentically representing a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.430" end="00:35:04.410" style="s2">black position because they diverged</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.670" end="00:35:06.660" style="s2">from the orthodoxy is something else</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.410" end="00:35:08.579" style="s2">altogether I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.660" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s what kind of the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.579" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">with Candis Owens because she inserts</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:14.220" style="s2">herself into the debate and then people</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:17.789" style="s2">can lump her with a guy who&#39;s a serious</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.220" end="00:35:19.980" style="s2">guy like John McWhorter and and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.789" end="00:35:23.250" style="s2">know this the whole conversation breaks</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.980" end="00:35:24.809" style="s2">down so why do you think things have</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.250" end="00:35:26.760" style="s2">shifted in this direction what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.809" end="00:35:30.390" style="s2">sense of why we&#39;ve moved in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.760" end="00:35:33.180" style="s2">direction since 2008 I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.390" end="00:35:35.460" style="s2">is real profound and in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.180" end="00:35:37.980" style="s2">justified disappointment with the limits</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.460" end="00:35:40.069" style="s2">of what actually happened I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.980" end="00:35:41.670" style="s2">certainly there&#39;s extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.069" end="00:35:44.579" style="s2">disappointment with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.670" end="00:35:47.549" style="s2">someone no matter what your politics are</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.579" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">someone is elegant and is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.549" end="00:35:53.069" style="s2">you know trying to do what he believes</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:54.660" style="s2">is right someone who was trying to unify</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.069" end="00:35:56.760" style="s2">the nation somebody like Barack Obama</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.660" end="00:36:00.119" style="s2">could be followed by someone like Donald</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.760" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">Trump who appeals to the most divisive</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.119" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">aspects of the American discourse who</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:07.650" style="s2">really it&#39;s an insult to follow brock</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">obama by donald trump and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.650" end="00:36:11.190" style="s2">there&#39;s really no way around that so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:13.260" style="s2">think that that exacerbated things quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.190" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">a bit I think you can&#39;t talk about any</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.260" end="00:36:17.789" style="s2">of this without talking about the impact</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:20.839" style="s2">of social media on all of our lives and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.789" end="00:36:24.450" style="s2">the kind of incentives that dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.839" end="00:36:28.230" style="s2">driven incentives that you know drive</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.450" end="00:36:30.059" style="s2">our politics of recrimination and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:34.049" style="s2">know the break us into warring tribes</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.059" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">following politics as a sport the kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.049" end="00:36:38.579" style="s2">of self-righteous witch-hunt that goes</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:41.789" style="s2">down to find somebody who&#39;s transgressed</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.579" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">and then shame them on social media you</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.789" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">know and then you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:49.260" style="s2">rediscovering your tribal identity makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:51.380" style="s2">me in turn rediscover mine and my travel</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.260" end="00:36:52.910" style="s2">feelings intensify so we and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.380" end="00:36:54.470" style="s2">see everything all the time now and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.910" end="00:36:55.700" style="s2">we&#39;re always in conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.470" end="00:36:57.559" style="s2">everything all the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.700" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">so all of these factors come into play</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.559" end="00:37:03.160" style="s2">at the same time and I think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:05.960" style="s2">trying to figure out how to make our</p>
