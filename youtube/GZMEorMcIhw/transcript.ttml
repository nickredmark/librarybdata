<p begin="00:01:30.789" end="00:01:36.399" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about today yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.850" end="00:01:39.310" style="s2">don&#39;t I I don&#39;t know how far back I want</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.140" end="00:01:45.520" style="s2">background and yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.759" end="00:01:47.590" style="s2">educationally I was I went to undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.520" end="00:01:50.140" style="s2">at Grand Valley State University which</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.590" end="00:01:53.950" style="s2">is just a small college and Allendale</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.140" end="00:01:56.590" style="s2">Michigan and I&#39;ve just been a reader for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.950" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">most of my adult life prodigious reader</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.590" end="00:02:01.960" style="s2">I like fiction a lot poetry I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">actually in literature for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.960" end="00:02:07.749" style="s2">but I was also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:10.990" style="s2">evolutionary psychology biology and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.749" end="00:02:12.940" style="s2">tried to I tried to find the field that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.990" end="00:02:13.340" style="s2">would allow me to sort of synthesize my</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.940" end="00:02:16.790" style="s2">disk</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">interests I thought psychology is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.790" end="00:02:21.890" style="s2">sort of the sort of like a focal point</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">where the humanities and the hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.890" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">sciences come together that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:27.590" style="s2">thought at least so that&#39;s why I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">into psychology has that has that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.590" end="00:02:33.980" style="s2">perspective changed at all since you got</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:37.690" style="s2">into it it&#39;s changed a lot yeah I well</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.980" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve become more skeptical of most</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.690" end="00:02:44.989" style="s2">psychology and I&#39;ve become more</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:47.420" style="s2">interested in oddly both history and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.989" end="00:02:49.790" style="s2">genetics I see as sort of the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.420" end="00:02:52.610" style="s2">important fields now for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.790" end="00:02:54.410" style="s2">human nature right and I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.610" end="00:02:57.049" style="s2">think that a lot of people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.410" end="00:02:59.150" style="s2">that same sense right and as the our</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.049" end="00:03:02.299" style="s2">ability to learn more about our genes</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.150" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">and how they play out in our day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.299" end="00:03:06.500" style="s2">lives in our culture and society I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:09.140" style="s2">more and more people are starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.500" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">that sense as well how has that affected</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.140" end="00:03:15.110" style="s2">your you know sort of your work in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:17.890" style="s2">field and and your your progress as a as</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.110" end="00:03:21.109" style="s2">a you know an evolutionary psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.890" end="00:03:25.579" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.109" end="00:03:28.880" style="s2">so I guess well so I still think</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.579" end="00:03:30.920" style="s2">evolutionary psychology is an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.880" end="00:03:34.519" style="s2">intellectual edifice it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.920" end="00:03:35.660" style="s2">sort of I mean because genetics they</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.519" end="00:03:37.549" style="s2">don&#39;t really make sense without</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.660" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">understanding natural selection and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:42.380" style="s2">understanding evolutionary theory so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">evolutionary psychology is still sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.380" end="00:03:48.380" style="s2">like the foundation of my thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">then just as far as most like</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.380" end="00:03:53.359" style="s2">traditional psychology you think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">lab studies and these sort of theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.359" end="00:03:58.970" style="s2">that aren&#39;t as grounded in evolution I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:00.709" style="s2">just don&#39;t have a lot of confidence that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.970" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">that are true or that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.709" end="00:04:06.170" style="s2">explaining much and we have replication</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:08.150" style="s2">crises and a lot of the effects that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.170" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">get are kind of small and it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.150" end="00:04:12.680" style="s2">what they mean and then I look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:15.019" style="s2">genetics and I see how much they their</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.680" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">fields actually progressive its advanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.019" end="00:04:21.229" style="s2">they&#39;re making new discoveries every</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:24.169" style="s2">year we&#39;re getting more associations</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.229" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">between snips as they call them single</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.169" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">nucleotide polymorphism</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:32.439" style="s2">and behaviors or traits and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:35.439" style="s2">amazing what they can do and that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.439" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">doing you know ancient DNA from</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.439" end="00:04:40.990" style="s2">Neanderthals and we&#39;re looking at me we</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:44.020" style="s2">know that Neanderthals and a lot mostly</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.990" end="00:04:45.939" style="s2">non Africans interbred these are things</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.020" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">that&#39;s like tangible progress right</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.939" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s knowledge that we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:51.669" style="s2">accumulated whereas I look at social</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">psychology and I&#39;m like are we any</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.669" end="00:04:56.229" style="s2">better than we were in 1950 do we do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:04:58.150" style="s2">know a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.229" end="00:05:00.190" style="s2">I mean maybe and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.150" end="00:05:02.169" style="s2">disparage Social Psychology too much I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.190" end="00:05:05.259" style="s2">a social psychologist technically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.169" end="00:05:08.139" style="s2">what my my dissertation my doctor is and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.259" end="00:05:10.270" style="s2">bought I&#39;m pretty disgruntled with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.139" end="00:05:12.069" style="s2">field of Social Psychology I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.270" end="00:05:13.479" style="s2">learned more from reading history books</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.069" end="00:05:15.370" style="s2">than I have from reading Social</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.479" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">Psychology tax laws well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.370" end="00:05:21.190" style="s2">interesting I heard a Peter teal and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">Eric Weinstein talking about how there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.190" end="00:05:27.129" style="s2">been a lot of progress in the science of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.889" end="00:05:29.110" style="s2">bits and technology but not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.129" end="00:05:32.259" style="s2">progress in the science of physics and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.110" end="00:05:34.990" style="s2">they sort of they didn&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.259" end="00:05:38.379" style="s2">genetics and it&#39;s interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.990" end="00:05:39.580" style="s2">bring up this idea that in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.379" end="00:05:40.990" style="s2">genetics there has been a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.580" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">progress and there has been a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.990" end="00:05:46.750" style="s2">learning and there there is a system in</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">place that seems to reward you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.750" end="00:05:50.860" style="s2">continued evolution and thinking there</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:52.659" style="s2">whereas in some of the other humanities</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.860" end="00:05:54.969" style="s2">especially it seems that the system in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.659" end="00:05:59.500" style="s2">place actually is retarding progress</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.969" end="00:06:02.289" style="s2">there yeah I think the thing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">genetics right is it depends because</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.289" end="00:06:07.449" style="s2">there is sort of the the smaller level</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:10.029" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the more broad</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.449" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">theoretical perspective and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.029" end="00:06:15.370" style="s2">theoretical perspective I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:17.169" style="s2">the field although it&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.370" end="00:06:20.650" style="s2">making progress and it&#39;s figuring out</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.650" end="00:06:26.680" style="s2">ancestries etc actually the theoretical</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:36.339" style="s2">the social sciences right there the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.630" end="00:06:39.009" style="s2">concerns about race about group</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.339" end="00:06:39.670" style="s2">differences those things actually do</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.670" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s just they don&#39;t affect the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.560" end="00:06:46.270" style="s2">concrete analyses and so you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:47.800" style="s2">progress in the concrete analyses but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.270" end="00:06:50.350" style="s2">then when people talk about like what</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.800" end="00:06:54.130" style="s2">does this mean etcetera and I can give</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.350" end="00:06:56.710" style="s2">you an example right for example Nicolas</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.130" end="00:06:59.350" style="s2">Wade&#39;s book a troublesome inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.710" end="00:07:04.180" style="s2">which was published I think it was 2014</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.350" end="00:07:06.640" style="s2">it might have been 2015 it was I I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.180" end="00:07:09.190" style="s2">advise any of your your listeners who</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.640" end="00:07:10.930" style="s2">are skeptical or who have heard bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.190" end="00:07:12.790" style="s2">things about it or read bad reviews</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.930" end="00:07:15.040" style="s2">about it to read it for themselves but</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.790" end="00:07:17.830" style="s2">there are some problems with it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.040" end="00:07:20.970" style="s2">a pretty good account of what we know</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.830" end="00:07:23.980" style="s2">about race today and it was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.970" end="00:07:25.900" style="s2">excoriated by population geneticists who</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.980" end="00:07:28.540" style="s2">ended up writing I don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.900" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">signed it I think 160 or some maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.540" end="00:07:34.060" style="s2">more signed this open letter denouncing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:37.480" style="s2">the book and then it got published in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.060" end="00:07:39.940" style="s2">the New York Times and it&#39;s just tragic</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.480" end="00:07:42.130" style="s2">to me because it&#39;s a book that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.940" end="00:07:44.830" style="s2">judicious and it tries to do a good job</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.130" end="00:07:47.050" style="s2">of sort of bringing population genetics</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.830" end="00:07:48.910" style="s2">together with what you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.050" end="00:07:50.620" style="s2">racial thinking for the past hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.910" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">years or whatever and putting this</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.620" end="00:07:55.140" style="s2">together in a synthesis that was really</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:58.870" style="s2">interesting and so that that&#39;s all you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.140" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">could you give a quick summary of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.870" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about there cuz for</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.270" style="s2">people oh yeah or just you know the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:06.220" style="s2">either sort of your takeaways from there</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.270" end="00:08:10.810" style="s2">that you you know caused you to remark</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.220" end="00:08:13.690" style="s2">on it here yeah yeah so I mean I was or</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.810" end="00:08:15.310" style="s2">is interesting because I already I kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.690" end="00:08:18.850" style="s2">of got into thinking about human</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.310" end="00:08:21.040" style="s2">variation and maybe in earnest and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.850" end="00:08:23.170" style="s2">like two thousand twelve or thirteen and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.040" end="00:08:24.820" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want to write anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.170" end="00:08:26.440" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t want to get myself in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.820" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">trouble and I wanted to get a job after</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.440" end="00:08:30.820" style="s2">I got out of grad school and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:32.350" style="s2">kind of just sitting on it and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.820" end="00:08:33.880" style="s2">about it and reading more about it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.350" end="00:08:35.970" style="s2">then I heard this book was coming out</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.880" end="00:08:38.260" style="s2">from Nicholas Wade and he was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.970" end="00:08:39.610" style="s2">respected science journalist at the New</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.260" end="00:08:42.100" style="s2">York Times who had been writing about</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.610" end="00:08:43.660" style="s2">human evolution and in fact he had - he</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.100" end="00:08:46.300" style="s2">had written two books previously about</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.660" end="00:08:46.820" style="s2">human evolution before the dawn and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.300" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.820" end="00:08:50.810" style="s2">religion that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t recall the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.650" end="00:08:53.090" style="s2">name so I was really excited about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.810" end="00:08:54.260" style="s2">and so the basic framework looks</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.090" end="00:08:57.740" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.260" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">humans this is a simplified story but</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.740" end="00:09:03.500" style="s2">something like this you know humans</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:06.650" style="s2">evolved in Africa and somewhere in you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.500" end="00:09:08.150" style="s2">know probably Eastern Africa I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.650" end="00:09:11.060" style="s2">exactly what it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.150" end="00:09:15.230" style="s2">about let&#39;s say 200,000 years ago or so</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.060" end="00:09:15.740" style="s2">and about 60,000 50,000 years ago or</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.230" end="00:09:18.500" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.740" end="00:09:20.990" style="s2">spread out up through the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.500" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">you know it&#39;s complicated because</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.990" end="00:09:25.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of admixture groups in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">Europe mixed with peoples from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.250" end="00:09:31.340" style="s2">steppes etc so it&#39;s a complicated story</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:33.770" style="s2">but humans you know inhabited many</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.340" end="00:09:36.200" style="s2">different regions of the world that had</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.770" end="00:09:38.990" style="s2">different selection pressures right they</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.200" end="00:09:40.910" style="s2">were colder they had long winters they</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.990" end="00:09:42.200" style="s2">had different flora and fauna</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.910" end="00:09:45.290" style="s2">they had different amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.200" end="00:09:46.820" style="s2">ultraviolet radiation and we what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.290" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">would expect from natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.820" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">pretty straightforward is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:52.820" style="s2">evolved in relative isolation again</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:55.460" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s admixture there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.820" end="00:09:58.610" style="s2">breeding going on but groups from</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.460" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">Scandinavia let&#39;s say from 3,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.610" end="00:10:04.030" style="s2">ago a lot of those people are in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">same basic area their ancestors right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.030" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">you evolve under different selective</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.680" end="00:10:10.670" style="s2">regimes you evolve different traits you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:12.530" style="s2">get different skin color you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.670" end="00:10:14.630" style="s2">different hair texture you get different</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.530" end="00:10:16.550" style="s2">no size you get different cheek</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.630" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">structures you get all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.550" end="00:10:21.530" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">um adaptations to altitude you get among</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.530" end="00:10:26.270" style="s2">Tibetans Ethiopians I believe and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.400" style="s2">somewhere in South America and South</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.270" end="00:10:30.890" style="s2">America all these different adaptations</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.400" end="00:10:32.450" style="s2">anyway so you get different groups what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.890" end="00:10:34.190" style="s2">we call race is you know those are the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.450" end="00:10:35.720" style="s2">broader categories so you can say</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.190" end="00:10:39.650" style="s2">continental races and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.720" end="00:10:43.430" style="s2">talking about Africans Asians North East</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.650" end="00:10:45.650" style="s2">Asians Europeans Oceania and American</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.430" end="00:10:48.500" style="s2">Indians or em or Indians or Indians</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.650" end="00:10:50.180" style="s2">Native American or whatever and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.500" end="00:10:53.720" style="s2">can subdivide those further and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.180" end="00:10:55.520" style="s2">basic idea is we would also expect</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.720" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">psychological differences among these</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.520" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">groups not huge differences right but</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.520" end="00:11:02.300" style="s2">just slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">and there are different propensity z&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.300" end="00:11:07.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s what Wade argued Wade argued</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:09.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what we would expect and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.490" end="00:11:10.850" style="s2">that&#39;s what evidence suggests and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.590" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">reason Wade thought it was really</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.850" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">important the thing he seemed to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:17.390" style="s2">was very interesting about this was it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:19.730" style="s2">suggests that different groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.390" end="00:11:21.110" style="s2">however you want to categorize em races</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.730" end="00:11:23.779" style="s2">human populations whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.110" end="00:11:26.029" style="s2">call them creates slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.779" end="00:11:26.750" style="s2">cultures because of the type of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.029" end="00:11:29.390" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.750" end="00:11:31.370" style="s2">right and so so Asians maybe are a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.390" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">little bit more agreeable a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.370" end="00:11:35.300" style="s2">more conformist than Europeans so they</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">create slightly different cultures than</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.300" end="00:11:41.930" style="s2">Europeans create and although they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">very small differences individual trades</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.930" end="00:11:46.190" style="s2">when you aggregate the people and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">create a culture that can lead to very</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.190" end="00:11:50.900" style="s2">big cultural difference rights right</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:52.520" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s the basic framework that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.900" end="00:11:55.370" style="s2">Wade had I had already come to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.520" end="00:11:57.260" style="s2">conclusion I&#39;m not I mean I&#39;m sure Wade</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.370" end="00:11:59.690" style="s2">had come to a long time before this but</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.260" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">I was already ripe for this idea I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.690" end="00:12:04.520" style="s2">these like very similar ideas that I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:08.030" style="s2">thinking about and when hit so what his</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.520" end="00:12:09.890" style="s2">book came out I think 2015 I decided to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.030" end="00:12:12.110" style="s2">go public I wrote a review of his book</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.890" end="00:12:13.820" style="s2">right I was like alright whatever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.110" end="00:12:16.339" style="s2">gonna write a review of his book and be</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.820" end="00:12:18.620" style="s2">honest about it with my brother and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.339" end="00:12:21.100" style="s2">I was like you know what these ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.620" end="00:12:24.080" style="s2">just too good they&#39;re too explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.100" end="00:12:26.600" style="s2">somebody needs to write a very good sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.080" end="00:12:28.339" style="s2">of popular article on this and so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.600" end="00:12:30.890" style="s2">eventually with my brother and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.339" end="00:12:34.550" style="s2">another professor Bryan Boutwell we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.890" end="00:12:37.970" style="s2">wrote an article about it for eventually</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.550" end="00:12:40.700" style="s2">got published in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.970" end="00:12:42.890" style="s2">psychological science so we wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.700" end="00:12:45.320" style="s2">article and I&#39;ve just been fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.890" end="00:12:48.200" style="s2">the separation stance and as you can see</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.320" end="00:12:50.060" style="s2">from my I think the review one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.200" end="00:12:53.060" style="s2">things you said we&#39;d talk about probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.060" end="00:12:56.750" style="s2">the review of the syma races also</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.060" end="00:12:58.250" style="s2">Alliance of race yeah so uh I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.750" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">gonna sort of freeze down here for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.250" end="00:13:02.510" style="s2">second you you were way shirt while you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:03.890" style="s2">were talking a question popped into my</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.510" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">head well first a comment and a question</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.890" end="00:13:08.780" style="s2">the first comment is like to me the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:10.550" style="s2">that this is some sort of radical notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.780" end="00:13:12.970" style="s2">that&#39;s like new on the scene in the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.550" end="00:13:16.420" style="s2">five to eight years seems crazy right</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.970" end="00:13:18.190" style="s2">it is it seems it seems very logical the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.420" end="00:13:21.580" style="s2">second thing was and this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.190" end="00:13:23.980" style="s2">just out of left field but if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.580" end="00:13:26.410" style="s2">aggregated differences result in</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.980" end="00:13:30.570" style="s2">slightly different cultures does that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.410" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">mean that perhaps these different these</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.570" end="00:13:34.810" style="s2">aggregated differences may also lend</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:37.530" style="s2">themselves to people thriving under</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:41.530" style="s2">various forms of government and also to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.530" end="00:13:43.090" style="s2">yeah that so what it was try to pin that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.530" end="00:13:44.050" style="s2">question because that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.090" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">and something that I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.050" end="00:13:48.370" style="s2">about lately I want to know something</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:50.110" style="s2">about the first comment you made the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.370" end="00:13:52.630" style="s2">first comment you made was about how</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.110" end="00:13:54.100" style="s2">this is some like radically new or idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.630" end="00:13:56.920" style="s2">or whatever it&#39;s just bizarre to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.100" end="00:13:58.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually a new idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.920" end="00:14:01.240" style="s2">something that people took for granted</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.210" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">since the 1800s and then it got it</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.240" end="00:14:05.590" style="s2">became so politically incorrect that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:07.840" style="s2">basically went underground so if you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.590" end="00:14:09.640" style="s2">back and you read for example I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.840" end="00:14:12.210" style="s2">reading the anthropologist Carleton</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.640" end="00:14:15.330" style="s2">Coons writings on race and he&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.210" end="00:14:17.710" style="s2">caricature it as just this silly racist</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.330" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">but you go and you readers work and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.710" end="00:14:21.580" style="s2">just I mean he&#39;s wrong about some things</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:25.990" style="s2">he&#39;s writing in the 40s 50s and 60s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.580" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">right but it&#39;s so it matches like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.990" end="00:14:30.610" style="s2">world as I see it quite well and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.440" style="s2">very informative and interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.610" end="00:14:34.450" style="s2">then at some point people stopped</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.440" end="00:14:35.830" style="s2">writing about it or most people did</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.450" end="00:14:37.870" style="s2">write because they just get you in</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.830" end="00:14:40.150" style="s2">trouble people call you racist you might</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.870" end="00:14:42.340" style="s2">lose your job etc so it&#39;s not a new idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.150" end="00:14:45.670" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like the rebirth of an old</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.340" end="00:14:47.620" style="s2">idea I would say the second question is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.670" end="00:14:49.510" style="s2">a very interesting one in the answer I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.620" end="00:14:54.550" style="s2">think the short answer to it is yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.510" end="00:14:56.589" style="s2">think that called people create cultures</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.550" end="00:14:59.290" style="s2">that are sort of attuned to their</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.589" end="00:15:02.290" style="s2">psychological traits and so it makes</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.290" end="00:15:04.380" style="s2">sense to me and we have to do a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.290" end="00:15:06.520" style="s2">research on this of course I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.380" end="00:15:09.670" style="s2">qualify it by saying I don&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.520" end="00:15:12.630" style="s2">is speculative with some evidence but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.670" end="00:15:16.180" style="s2">makes sense to me that yes if you put</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.630" end="00:15:17.980" style="s2">say a bunch of Japanese people together</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.180" end="00:15:20.650" style="s2">they will create a culture that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.980" end="00:15:23.890" style="s2">different from the culture that a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:26.080" style="s2">of German people will make and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.890" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">different in a way that suits that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.080" end="00:15:30.760" style="s2">and tendencies and and that means I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">think and this is something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.760" end="00:15:37.630" style="s2">kind of grappling with now that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:39.339" style="s2">Universal liberalism maybe isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.630" end="00:15:40.779" style="s2">ideal for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.339" end="00:15:42.550" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t and now this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.779" end="00:15:44.200" style="s2">interesting right because when I had</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.550" end="00:15:46.839" style="s2">this tweet about this and people went</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.200" end="00:15:49.060" style="s2">crazy on it and we&#39;re saying oh are you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.839" end="00:15:51.180" style="s2">saying human rights aren&#39;t universal no</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.060" end="00:15:54.459" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.180" end="00:15:57.959" style="s2">maybe certain people like what we would</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.459" end="00:16:00.790" style="s2">consider an unnecessarily authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.959" end="00:16:01.630" style="s2">social structure might not be to certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.790" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.630" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">right I mean it would that also apply</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:13.209" style="s2">sort of with it to the strata within the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.870" end="00:16:15.670" style="s2">same same group so what you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.209" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">just sort of in a hierarchies within the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.670" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">same groups right like maybe people with</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:23.140" style="s2">different cognitive abilities different</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:25.180" style="s2">emotional makeups and whatnot may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.140" end="00:16:28.180" style="s2">more inclined to thrive under certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.180" end="00:16:30.850" style="s2">governments or regimes and yeah and all</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.180" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">the alternatives as well what&#39;s crazy is</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.850" end="00:16:34.300" style="s2">I wrote down on this question while</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.279" style="s2">reading your stuff and I scratched it</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.300" end="00:16:39.579" style="s2">out because it&#39;s too dangerous to ask</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.279" end="00:16:41.200" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna ask I&#39;m gonna ask but and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.579" end="00:16:43.630" style="s2">then we then we can actually just ask</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.200" end="00:16:45.010" style="s2">the the revised question the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.630" end="00:16:47.980" style="s2">question was does everyone deserve</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.010" end="00:16:49.720" style="s2">freedom and I I scratched that out</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.980" end="00:16:51.070" style="s2">because man we can&#39;t start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.720" end="00:16:54.430" style="s2">that so let&#39;s stuff let&#39;s change it to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.070" end="00:16:57.820" style="s2">does everyone thrive in freedom right</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.430" end="00:16:59.829" style="s2">right okay so so be yeah because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.820" end="00:17:02.829" style="s2">everybody deserve freedom sansa so</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.829" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">freedom&#39;s like an unbridled good and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.829" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">like if you&#39;re a good if you&#39;re a decent</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:09.220" style="s2">human you you should get it but maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:11.530" style="s2">not you don&#39;t deserve it or something so</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.220" end="00:17:15.040" style="s2">so yeah I think the second question is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.530" end="00:17:17.530" style="s2">better and I would say no I would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.040" end="00:17:19.870" style="s2">they don&#39;t I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.530" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">there&#39;s strong evidence that now I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.870" end="00:17:23.770" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s hard about this right</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:26.949" style="s2">is that the word freedom especially in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.770" end="00:17:28.440" style="s2">the United States just sounds as though</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.949" end="00:17:30.520" style="s2">it&#39;s an unalloyed Rahad</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.440" end="00:17:31.510" style="s2">everybody loves freedom if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.520" end="00:17:33.550" style="s2">against freedom</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.510" end="00:17:35.950" style="s2">you&#39;re an evildoer or a bad person or</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.550" end="00:17:38.520" style="s2">whatever right so when you say some</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.950" end="00:17:44.850" style="s2">people don&#39;t thrive</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.520" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">in in a free they don&#39;t use freedom as</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.850" end="00:17:48.840" style="s2">responsibly as other people that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">bad but I don&#39;t think that it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.840" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">and I don&#39;t even think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.470" style="s2">necessarily good to thrive in freedom</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:17:56.940" style="s2">I&#39;m not really making value judgments on</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.470" end="00:17:59.880" style="s2">it so let&#39;s take a difference I take a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.940" end="00:18:01.770" style="s2">clear example I don&#39;t think those people</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.880" end="00:18:05.010" style="s2">would look at are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.770" end="00:18:06.390" style="s2">Amish people sure okay the Anabaptist I</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.010" end="00:18:08.630" style="s2">think most people in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.390" end="00:18:11.309" style="s2">are familiar with them at least I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.630" end="00:18:13.559" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it they&#39;re they&#39;re not and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.309" end="00:18:15.660" style="s2">don&#39;t inhabit a liberal society liberal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.559" end="00:18:17.550" style="s2">with a smaller all right not liberal but</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:19.800" style="s2">liberal I don&#39;t think anybody would look</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.550" end="00:18:23.250" style="s2">at the Amish is sort of the Paragons of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.800" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">freedom on the other hand it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.250" end="00:18:28.590" style="s2">that their culture works for them and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:31.170" style="s2">that the people who inhabit it are to my</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.590" end="00:18:33.300" style="s2">knowledge perfectly happy with it and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.170" end="00:18:35.910" style="s2">don&#39;t see why that&#39;s wrong that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.300" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">probably not a battery and I get I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.910" end="00:18:40.679" style="s2">so you could look across the Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:42.330" style="s2">think a in China so like maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.679" end="00:18:44.340" style="s2">they&#39;re just inclined in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.330" end="00:18:46.050" style="s2">to have a different relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.340" end="00:18:48.600" style="s2">their government and and culture and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.050" end="00:18:50.550" style="s2">society I mean it&#39;s that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.600" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">where it gets tricky though because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.550" end="00:18:55.020" style="s2">like you don&#39;t want to go too far so</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:18:57.300" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want people to think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.020" end="00:18:59.700" style="s2">going so far as to say what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.300" end="00:19:01.050" style="s2">Tiananmen Square was like a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.700" end="00:19:03.720" style="s2">or something right you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.050" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">right or that like Mao Zedong&#39;s rate</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.720" end="00:19:09.000" style="s2">regime was like a benevolent regime if</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.160" style="s2">only you&#39;re a Han Chinese person or</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.000" end="00:19:12.809" style="s2">something no but what we are saying is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.160" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">and I do think this it&#39;s true like if</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.809" end="00:19:19.559" style="s2">you you know you look at an Asian city</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:22.679" style="s2">for example I mean the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.559" end="00:19:25.800" style="s2">you cramp into an area right he&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.679" end="00:19:28.050" style="s2">the population density is off the charts</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.800" end="00:19:30.360" style="s2">and I think a lot of Europeans would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.050" end="00:19:32.340" style="s2">uncomfortable living like that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.360" end="00:19:34.530" style="s2">just not a problem or it&#39;s not as much</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.340" end="00:19:36.330" style="s2">of a problem for agents I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.530" end="00:19:37.890" style="s2">just like one example and I see no</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.330" end="00:19:39.540" style="s2">reason again and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.890" end="00:19:41.490" style="s2">important and this is what trips people</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.540" end="00:19:44.309" style="s2">up when we have these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.490" end="00:19:47.070" style="s2">conversations is that they always bring</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.309" end="00:19:49.559" style="s2">value judgments into it right and like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.070" end="00:19:51.520" style="s2">don&#39;t think you need to it&#39;s I like</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.559" end="00:19:53.050" style="s2">Anglo society don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">get me wrong I like it I like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.050" end="00:19:57.070" style="s2">British tradition of freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:19:59.230" style="s2">liberalism but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.070" end="00:20:01.210" style="s2">necessarily better for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.230" end="00:20:03.310" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not trying to say that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.210" end="00:20:04.450" style="s2">think it works for people who like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.310" end="00:20:06.760" style="s2">and for people who have certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.450" end="00:20:08.380" style="s2">psychological tendencies but it might</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.760" end="00:20:09.730" style="s2">not work for other people and they make</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.380" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">a different culture and here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.730" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">another important thing that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:18.670" style="s2">is worth saying is I in my ideal sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:21.420" style="s2">vision of the world you would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.670" end="00:20:23.710" style="s2">join the group who&#39;s psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.420" end="00:20:27.190" style="s2">psychological propensity smach your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.710" end="00:20:29.230" style="s2">so like if I you know maybe I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.190" end="00:20:31.900" style="s2">enamoured with Asian culture and I want</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.230" end="00:20:33.670" style="s2">to become like sort of qualified</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.900" end="00:20:35.920" style="s2">Japanese if you will</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.670" end="00:20:38.650" style="s2">now I understand Japan doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.920" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">become majority European but maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.650" end="00:20:42.430" style="s2">let in one two percent and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:43.810" style="s2">identify with that Society I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.430" end="00:20:46.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing right</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.810" end="00:20:48.700" style="s2">right right well you know all these</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.180" end="00:20:53.050" style="s2">things good good bad by what by what</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.700" end="00:20:54.670" style="s2">measure all right that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.050" end="00:20:58.300" style="s2">other thing and and I you know again</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.670" end="00:21:00.910" style="s2">freestyling here like we use our economy</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.300" end="00:21:03.190" style="s2">we use a GDP you know and growth and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.910" end="00:21:04.690" style="s2">like well okay that&#39;s good but who is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.190" end="00:21:06.070" style="s2">good for like what it what are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.690" end="00:21:07.510" style="s2">metrics that we&#39;re using to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.070" end="00:21:09.910" style="s2">whether or not something that&#39;s positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.510" end="00:21:13.750" style="s2">positive right oh we always difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.910" end="00:21:16.540" style="s2">yeah yeah I think when I say that I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.750" end="00:21:19.690" style="s2">in my mind like some sort of idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.540" end="00:21:22.660" style="s2">human psychological well-being right</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.690" end="00:21:25.240" style="s2">right so if you I guess I put it this</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.660" end="00:21:28.690" style="s2">way so let&#39;s say that you&#39;re a Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.240" end="00:21:31.390" style="s2">person and you have traits that make</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.690" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">Anglo societies really appealing to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.390" end="00:21:37.830" style="s2">and you feel as though maybe Japanese is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">bad because they have a little more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.830" end="00:21:42.610" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a little less collectivistic</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">than some of the other Asian countries</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.610" end="00:21:47.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s a little bit more I believe</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.710" end="00:21:49.390" style="s2">still than than a Anglo society so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.710" end="00:21:51.010" style="s2">say you want to become a part of an</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.390" end="00:21:52.600" style="s2">angle of society and that would make you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.010" end="00:21:56.200" style="s2">happier or it would make you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.600" end="00:21:58.450" style="s2">psychologically flourish I would think</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.200" end="00:22:00.190" style="s2">that&#39;s good if you carry on if you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.450" end="00:22:02.110" style="s2">if you&#39;re allowed to flourish in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.190" end="00:22:03.140" style="s2">whatever way that is that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.110" end="00:22:06.710" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.140" end="00:22:09.460" style="s2">right you know this idea of grouping</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.710" end="00:22:12.350" style="s2">ourselves with people with similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.460" end="00:22:14.140" style="s2">psychological profiles or</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.350" end="00:22:18.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t know characteristics or whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.140" end="00:22:19.130" style="s2">that&#39;s fascinating concept to me had not</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.020" end="00:22:21.380" style="s2">really thought a bit from that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.130" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">perspective but I do continuously think</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.380" end="00:22:27.470" style="s2">about how Twitter social media has</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">allowed us to congregate with people</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.470" end="00:22:33.530" style="s2">based on like-minded views and shared</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:35.570" style="s2">values mm-hmm rather than geography or</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.530" end="00:22:38.690" style="s2">happenstance or there in your college</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.570" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">dorm or whatever it would arise and for</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.690" end="00:22:42.380" style="s2">me that&#39;s been transformative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:44.870" style="s2">really and that&#39;s sort of the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.380" end="00:22:46.100" style="s2">for a lot of the work that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.870" end="00:22:48.140" style="s2">which is like building communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.100" end="00:22:51.800" style="s2">around shared values that transcend</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.140" end="00:22:53.690" style="s2">geography and and and all the rest and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.800" end="00:22:56.210" style="s2">something you said also made me think</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.690" end="00:22:57.470" style="s2">and also in doing some reading of yours</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.210" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.470" end="00:23:04.370" style="s2">if are the psychological characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">of the group prone to change and if so</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.370" end="00:23:09.530" style="s2">does that then mean to that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">type of culture society government that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.530" end="00:23:14.420" style="s2">is best suited for those people would</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:16.580" style="s2">change over time as well yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.420" end="00:23:19.370" style="s2">that I think there&#39;s good evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.580" end="00:23:22.670" style="s2">it does at least to a degree so there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.370" end="00:23:24.440" style="s2">research by um there&#39;s some researchers</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.670" end="00:23:27.800" style="s2">I really like and modernism</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:30.230" style="s2">or I guess modernist theory ronald</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.800" end="00:23:32.180" style="s2">Englehart and ritual richard I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.230" end="00:23:36.470" style="s2">it&#39;s well Christian well so excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.180" end="00:23:38.930" style="s2">and they look at the way values changed</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.470" end="00:23:42.260" style="s2">with existential security and affluence</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.930" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">basically like the more safe you are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.260" end="00:23:47.570" style="s2">more your needs you&#39;re sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:49.550" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy almost right the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.570" end="00:23:52.100" style="s2">that your primitive needs are taken care</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.550" end="00:23:55.370" style="s2">of and the more secure you feel the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.100" end="00:23:59.330" style="s2">you people tend to value self-expression</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.370" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">and secular values and and there&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.330" end="00:24:04.610" style="s2">have pretty good evidence that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:06.800" style="s2">trend that occurs in all societies are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.610" end="00:24:09.740" style="s2">pretty much every society from they look</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.800" end="00:24:12.080" style="s2">at world value survey and other datasets</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.740" end="00:24:13.670" style="s2">and that would suggest that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.080" end="00:24:16.490" style="s2">also what&#39;s interesting that they found</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.670" end="00:24:20.360" style="s2">is that there&#39;s sort of like a critical</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.490" end="00:24:22.040" style="s2">period during which your values are kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.360" end="00:24:24.020" style="s2">of set and it&#39;s you know let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.040" end="00:24:27.230" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember exactly but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.020" end="00:24:29.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like between 8 and 18 so like if</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.230" end="00:24:30.440" style="s2">you grow up in this environment during</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.180" end="00:24:33.230" style="s2">that time and then the environment</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.440" end="00:24:36.700" style="s2">changes you tend to keep the values that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.230" end="00:24:39.140" style="s2">you grew up in there sort of like and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.700" end="00:24:42.770" style="s2">what that suggests is that it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.140" end="00:24:45.290" style="s2">sort of psychological calibration to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.770" end="00:24:47.560" style="s2">world you inhabit as like a teenager in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.290" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">some sense and then your values are</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.560" end="00:24:53.480" style="s2">roughly shaped by that for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:56.290" style="s2">your life basically but it does suggest</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.480" end="00:24:58.550" style="s2">that as society gets wealthier and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.290" end="00:25:02.510" style="s2">people are more safe and they can take</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.550" end="00:25:04.550" style="s2">care of needs food shelter etc they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.510" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">going to change that are traits do</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.550" end="00:25:08.060" style="s2">change a little bit they do because they</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:09.740" style="s2">want freedom more they want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.060" end="00:25:12.410" style="s2">to express themselves those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.740" end="00:25:15.770" style="s2">things matter more to them and that does</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.410" end="00:25:18.050" style="s2">suggest that the optimal Society you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.770" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">see you&#39;re in a society it changes it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.050" end="00:25:22.670" style="s2">changes for the next generation in each</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:25.430" style="s2">generation changes a little bit right</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.670" end="00:25:28.070" style="s2">and I mean I guess this is uh this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.430" end="00:25:31.130" style="s2">sort of common sense that the younger</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.070" end="00:25:33.710" style="s2">generation always rebels right they</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.130" end="00:25:35.540" style="s2">always want they go against these values</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.710" end="00:25:36.050" style="s2">and stuff and you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.540" end="00:25:37.280" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.050" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">apparently so yeah that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.280" end="00:25:43.390" style="s2">thing does that I&#39;m just crazy maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:45.170" style="s2">like to me than all that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.390" end="00:25:50.560" style="s2">constitutionally based government</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.170" end="00:25:53.660" style="s2">anchored in time would be problematic</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.560" end="00:25:55.370" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s a good so the way I</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.660" end="00:25:58.010" style="s2">think of a constitutionally based</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.370" end="00:26:00.980" style="s2">government is that it should be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.010" end="00:26:03.830" style="s2">the bare minimum structure that you need</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.980" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">to preserve some sort of order in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.830" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">society and I mean I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:15.230" style="s2">personally I mean I do I I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:17.330" style="s2">strong political identity but I I I tend</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.230" end="00:26:20.030" style="s2">towards some sort of Burkean</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.330" end="00:26:21.680" style="s2">conservatism so I&#39;m generally cautious</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.030" end="00:26:23.130" style="s2">about change so I think it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.680" end="00:26:25.049" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.130" end="00:26:27.929" style="s2">and to attempt to preserve what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.049" end="00:26:31.409" style="s2">working but there is inevitably going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.929" end="00:26:32.460" style="s2">be this conflict that younger people you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.409" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">know they&#39;re gonna want to dye their</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.460" end="00:26:36.149" style="s2">hair and get a lot of piercings and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.740" style="s2">tattoos and express themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.149" end="00:26:40.139" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna care more about symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.740" end="00:26:41.730" style="s2">things we think it&#39;s all about like well</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.139" end="00:26:43.799" style="s2">you should be carrying about the economy</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.730" end="00:26:45.720" style="s2">and financial things and to them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.799" end="00:26:48.120" style="s2">like no you should care about opinions</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.720" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">and symbolic expression and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.120" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">this explains partially virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">because to them that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.590" end="00:26:56.610" style="s2">do you have the right moral opinion is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:59.100" style="s2">something that&#39;s more valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.610" end="00:27:01.139" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s seventeen and grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.100" end="00:27:02.700" style="s2">a completely affluent world in which you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.139" end="00:27:04.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to worry about where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.700" end="00:27:07.830" style="s2">gonna get the meal tomorrow you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.940" end="00:27:10.139" style="s2">well you know this is this dovetails</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.830" end="00:27:12.389" style="s2">very nicely into the conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.139" end="00:27:16.200" style="s2">wanted to have with you about your</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.389" end="00:27:20.610" style="s2">writings on the West the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.200" end="00:27:22.679" style="s2">and the depth of liberal liberalism yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.610" end="00:27:24.570" style="s2">you want to just sort of give a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.679" end="00:27:26.220" style="s2">background on that big piece you did for</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.570" end="00:27:28.710" style="s2">quill that sort of like set the stage</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.220" end="00:27:30.509" style="s2">for us here cuz there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.710" end="00:27:34.110" style="s2">fascinating stuff in that piece man</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.509" end="00:27:35.940" style="s2">which which one specific there were two</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.110" end="00:27:38.610" style="s2">there was one was like the twilight of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.940" end="00:27:40.950" style="s2">liberalism and one was progressivism in</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.610" end="00:27:42.509" style="s2">the West I&#39;m combining the two because</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.950" end="00:27:45.870" style="s2">because they work I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.509" end="00:27:48.860" style="s2">related right so yeah I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.870" end="00:27:51.240" style="s2">think yes yeah that&#39;s a good that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.860" end="00:27:54.090" style="s2">because because people have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.240" end="00:27:55.529" style="s2">you know people I come from I come from</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.090" end="00:27:58.830" style="s2">the backwaters of the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.529" end="00:28:00.750" style="s2">originally right like and on the fringes</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.830" end="00:28:03.539" style="s2">for years now people have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.750" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">that progressivism and liberalism that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.539" end="00:28:07.529" style="s2">we are the progressive them that we see</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:11.250" style="s2">today is leading towards you know an</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.529" end="00:28:14.100" style="s2">erosion of Western society and to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.250" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">that five eight years ago what you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.100" end="00:28:20.220" style="s2">just you know absolutely insane person</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:22.440" style="s2">but like you know people more and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.220" end="00:28:24.899" style="s2">well respected folks are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.440" end="00:28:27.419" style="s2">acknowledge that that this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.899" end="00:28:31.409" style="s2">the case and that our American politics</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.419" end="00:28:34.300" style="s2">currently are leading in a direction at</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.409" end="00:28:36.220" style="s2">least some factions antithetical to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.300" end="00:28:38.950" style="s2">actual society and civilization that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.220" end="00:28:41.110" style="s2">were based on and we are sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.950" end="00:28:43.900" style="s2">torchbearer for so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.110" end="00:28:45.430" style="s2">fascinating moment to be aware of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.900" end="00:28:47.500" style="s2">happening and and your two pieces</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.430" end="00:28:49.930" style="s2">together I thought were really relative</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.500" end="00:28:52.810" style="s2">relevant and timely so let&#39;s let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.930" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">at again well so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.810" end="00:28:57.430" style="s2">because I I didn&#39;t participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.000" end="00:28:59.620" style="s2">back waters of the internet so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.430" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">know what people were saying there but</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.620" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">I&#39;m sure that if I had encountered</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.360" end="00:29:06.730" style="s2">argument say ten years ago I probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:09.960" style="s2">would have thought it was crazy too and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.730" end="00:29:12.940" style="s2">in fact I even thought it was at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.960" end="00:29:14.650" style="s2">hyperbolic maybe two years ago and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.940" end="00:29:20.200" style="s2">I started to become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.650" end="00:29:22.360" style="s2">alarmed by these things that were you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.200" end="00:29:26.110" style="s2">know just becoming more commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.360" end="00:29:27.850" style="s2">right and the more I thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.110" end="00:29:32.680" style="s2">and the more I witnessed it and the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.850" end="00:29:35.110" style="s2">I had to I mean I I&#39;m sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.680" end="00:29:37.780" style="s2">epicenter of progressivism in academia</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.110" end="00:29:40.510" style="s2">right I mean this is it doesn&#39;t get more</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.780" end="00:29:43.180" style="s2">progressive I don&#39;t think it did start</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.510" end="00:29:45.550" style="s2">to alarm me and I see I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.180" end="00:29:48.250" style="s2">watching the Democratic debates has only</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.550" end="00:29:52.590" style="s2">persuaded me that article was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.250" end="00:29:56.410" style="s2">correct right right like it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.590" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">the this progressivism and and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.410" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">be clearer I I&#39;m not like a I&#39;m not like</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:04.420" style="s2">a super conservative person I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:07.300" style="s2">like kind of a populist economically um</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.420" end="00:30:09.790" style="s2">so I&#39;m not coming at this from I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.300" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve never voted for a Republican in my</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.790" end="00:30:15.390" style="s2">life right I&#39;ve always voted Democrat so</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:18.010" style="s2">I&#39;m coming at this from a wayward</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.390" end="00:30:21.640" style="s2">Democrat who&#39;s just alarmed with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.010" end="00:30:24.670" style="s2">happened to the last coalition and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.640" end="00:30:27.310" style="s2">argument hardened yeah okay yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.670" end="00:30:29.050" style="s2">I run into a lot of people who even my</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.310" end="00:30:30.520" style="s2">mother I was talking to my mother and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.050" end="00:30:33.390" style="s2">she was just like what&#39;s happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.520" end="00:30:36.070" style="s2">Democratic Party I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.390" end="00:30:38.170" style="s2">so I guess the you know I was very</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.070" end="00:30:40.450" style="s2">alarmed by it and people were I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.170" end="00:30:42.160" style="s2">crying I was basically like a both Sider</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.450" end="00:30:44.140" style="s2">you know I was like both sides are</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.160" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">exaggerating the threats on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.140" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:49.400" style="s2">you know they both have problems but</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:52.250" style="s2">people made a lot of good arguments to</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.400" end="00:30:54.710" style="s2">me about the dangers of progressiva so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.250" end="00:30:56.450" style="s2">mean I I I just became persuaded that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.710" end="00:30:58.490" style="s2">that was correct and then I started</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.450" end="00:31:01.340" style="s2">thinking about it and reading articles</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.490" end="00:31:04.010" style="s2">and picking out the problems with it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.340" end="00:31:07.670" style="s2">I think I ended up you I think I had six</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.010" end="00:31:09.500" style="s2">of them in that article you know and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.670" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">can go over each of them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.500" end="00:31:14.450" style="s2">each interesting but there are just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:17.240" style="s2">number of these alarming trends that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.450" end="00:31:19.850" style="s2">seem only to beginning worse so far as I</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.240" end="00:31:22.610" style="s2">can tell about progressivism and the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.850" end="00:31:25.610" style="s2">that it it seems to me I think as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.610" end="00:31:27.710" style="s2">said antithetical to Western values now</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.610" end="00:31:30.020" style="s2">I know this is what the brig Asif will</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.710" end="00:31:32.059" style="s2">say so to be fair to the progressive he</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.020" end="00:31:34.460" style="s2">or she&#39;s gonna say well what&#39;s Western</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.059" end="00:31:36.620" style="s2">civilization right and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.460" end="00:31:38.990" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to define but there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.620" end="00:31:41.840" style="s2">certain features of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.990" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">respect for the individual personal</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.840" end="00:31:48.170" style="s2">autonomy rule of law equality before the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:50.900" style="s2">law private property markets etc these</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.170" end="00:31:53.780" style="s2">things that worked so well that Western</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.900" end="00:31:55.670" style="s2">civilization reached the peak of human</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.780" end="00:31:57.920" style="s2">you know like human civilization the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.670" end="00:32:01.340" style="s2">peak of human civilization is the West</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.920" end="00:32:03.650" style="s2">from you know I don&#39;t know 1700 and tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.340" end="00:32:06.170" style="s2">Mallory right and and that&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.650" end="00:32:08.150" style="s2">would like to attempt to preserve so</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.020" end="00:34:46.970" style="s2">it the what&#39;s happening here it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:50.630" style="s2">me is that the 2% of the most educated</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.970" end="00:34:53.330" style="s2">elite part of the population that - top</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.630" end="00:34:56.840" style="s2">2% or whatever they have such an</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.330" end="00:34:59.900" style="s2">outsized influence on culture because</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.840" end="00:35:02.390" style="s2">they have access to the media to the</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.390" end="00:35:08.690" style="s2">and not only are they that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.410" end="00:35:11.570" style="s2">content with just having like almost a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.690" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">monopoly there but they moralize so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.570" end="00:35:16.220" style="s2">that if you if you forward alternative</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2">views not only do they just try to kick</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.220" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">you out of it but they try to call you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.750" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">an immoral person you&#39;re a sexist you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:27.500" style="s2">mean it&#39;s just odd because if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.130" end="00:35:30.020" style="s2">like I have friends who aren&#39;t in</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.020" end="00:35:34.430" style="s2">and they have no idea what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.880" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">right they like traditional sax rolls</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.430" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">right like they think like men being too</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:43.970" style="s2">masculine and having some kind of outlet</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:46.100" style="s2">for that and women being feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.970" end="00:35:48.110" style="s2">they don&#39;t think that it&#39;s bad that you</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.110" end="00:35:52.100" style="s2">they&#39;re not forcing their wives to but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.360" end="00:35:54.020" style="s2">they think that these kind of sacks</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.100" end="00:35:57.950" style="s2">walls give people meaning in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.020" end="00:36:00.470" style="s2">and a way to sort of channel their sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.950" end="00:36:02.120" style="s2">of natural proclivities if you will and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.470" end="00:36:03.710" style="s2">I think that&#39;s really important I do I</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.120" end="00:36:07.430" style="s2">was actually talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.710" end="00:36:09.590" style="s2">yesterday was somebody just how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.430" end="00:36:12.890" style="s2">unfortunate that you know we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.590" end="00:36:15.050" style="s2">destroy these sex roles but for most</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.890" end="00:36:17.060" style="s2">people for most of the time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.050" end="00:36:19.010" style="s2">probably good they give people a sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.060" end="00:36:21.170" style="s2">of meaning and purpose and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.010" end="00:36:23.690" style="s2">disappoint you and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.170" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">because you can&#39;t have freedom without</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.690" end="00:36:27.710" style="s2">some kind of guide without some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:30.140" style="s2">disappoint for that freedom without some</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.710" end="00:36:32.180" style="s2">sort of expectation that hey if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.140" end="00:36:34.100" style="s2">gonna be a man here&#39;s what you do you</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.870" end="00:36:41.030" style="s2">and that gives you you know meaning in</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.610" end="00:36:54.230" style="s2">are really important for people and when</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.380" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">you eradicate those traditions so</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.230" end="00:36:57.530" style="s2">quickly - that&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:00.230" style="s2">kind of alarming to me about this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.530" end="00:37:04.210" style="s2">it&#39;s happened so quickly like I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.230" end="00:37:07.820" style="s2">thinking compare the 2016 Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.210" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">primaries to the 2008 I mean even in</p>

<p begin="00:38:41.790" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">sports if you identify as a woman that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.530" end="00:38:49.830" style="s2">kind of stuff all of that&#39;s happening so</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:52.590" style="s2">quickly and the debate about it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.830" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">mostly silenced you can&#39;t even have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.590" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">debate which is another problem it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:57.390" style="s2">same thing with immigration which maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">we can get into but like these are</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.390" end="00:39:01.500" style="s2">issues where you&#39;re not even really</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:03.450" style="s2">allowed to have the debate and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.500" end="00:39:06.450" style="s2">what really disconcerts me about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.450" end="00:39:09.270" style="s2">right right well freedom of speech and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.450" end="00:39:12.360" style="s2">ideas and competition of ideas these</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.270" end="00:39:13.560" style="s2">things are you know not allowed you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.360" end="00:39:15.510" style="s2">not allowed to have a competition</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.560" end="00:39:17.550" style="s2">because you&#39;re not allowed to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.510" end="00:39:21.570" style="s2">hierarchies because hierarchies are bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.550" end="00:39:23.850" style="s2">I want to I want to get into hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.570" end="00:39:26.970" style="s2">with you in a second but I want to just</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.850" end="00:39:29.700" style="s2">go back to this concept of guardrails I</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.970" end="00:39:33.210" style="s2">believe in your writing as I picked up</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.700" end="00:39:36.450" style="s2">on how there&#39;s liberalism leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.210" end="00:39:40.350" style="s2">removal that guardrails and and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.450" end="00:39:42.510" style="s2">making a distinction between the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.350" end="00:39:45.030" style="s2">government telling you how to live and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.510" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">your your society or your culture and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.030" end="00:39:49.560" style="s2">your peers sort of telling you how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:52.440" style="s2">them the former bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.560" end="00:39:55.290" style="s2">the latter good right like we need we</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.440" end="00:39:59.250" style="s2">need like checks and balances and norms</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.290" end="00:40:02.390" style="s2">and and customs culturally enforced</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.250" end="00:40:05.240" style="s2">culturally like Peter sign with his</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.390" end="00:40:08.970" style="s2">enforcement nanami concept that blew up</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.240" end="00:40:14.190" style="s2">last year I remember and and that these</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.970" end="00:40:16.290" style="s2">guardrails are coming down and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.190" end="00:40:19.590" style="s2">gonna happen and and where is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.290" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">leading and what what is that what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.590" end="00:40:26.310" style="s2">the end product of liberalism anyway is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:28.980" style="s2">it is it no constraints I mean is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.310" end="00:40:31.410" style="s2">the is that the goal is the goal to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.980" end="00:40:32.970" style="s2">unconstrained period without regard for</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.410" end="00:40:35.100" style="s2">that thing so I mean that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.970" end="00:40:37.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right and this is where this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.100" end="00:40:40.260" style="s2">where I am sort of politically and on so</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.800" end="00:40:42.990" style="s2">many issues right now which is is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.260" end="00:40:46.830" style="s2">process more important or the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.990" end="00:40:49.020" style="s2">more important and because I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.830" end="00:40:51.510" style="s2">struggling with that because maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.020" end="00:40:54.810" style="s2">that&#39;s really because maybe the process</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.510" end="00:40:56.940" style="s2">leads us to bad places but maybe the if</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.810" end="00:40:59.310" style="s2">we focus on the outcomes it leads to bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.940" end="00:41:00.990" style="s2">process it&#39;s like let&#39;s talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.310" end="00:41:03.810" style="s2">and the guardrails in liberalism like</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.990" end="00:41:06.060" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to our culture well so</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.810" end="00:41:07.590" style="s2">that second that that thing you said</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.060" end="00:41:09.750" style="s2">your ass when I wrestle with that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.590" end="00:41:12.540" style="s2">too so we&#39;ll set that one aside first</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.750" end="00:41:15.210" style="s2">because that&#39;s more tricky to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.540" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">the it syndra yeah so like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.210" end="00:41:20.430" style="s2">important you know we&#39;re not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.390" end="00:41:22.290" style="s2">as like somewhat socially conservative</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.430" end="00:41:23.880" style="s2">person I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.290" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">government should be doing this I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.880" end="00:41:29.940" style="s2">in fact I like it that you know churches</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:32.490" style="s2">do it or the community and look I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.940" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">choice I&#39;m glad that we don&#39;t inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.490" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">like 1620 say MoMA or something I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">that there&#39;s more freedom right but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.380" style="s2">I do I have become more convinced of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:46.579" style="s2">this that there is this sort of ennui</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.380" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">alienation that&#39;s happening because</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.579" end="00:41:54.200" style="s2">people just don&#39;t have a meaningful sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:56.329" style="s2">of path in life a narrative symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.200" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">path that&#39;s carved out for them by</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.329" end="00:42:02.089" style="s2">community norms and standards and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">some people thrive with this because</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.089" end="00:42:06.410" style="s2">they&#39;re you know very intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">self-discipline controlled people they</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.410" end="00:42:11.569" style="s2">can achieve in that kind of environment</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:15.890" style="s2">in which you don&#39;t have that right a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.569" end="00:42:17.690" style="s2">of other people unfortunately they play</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.890" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">a lot of video games and use a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.690" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">drugs and you know that r22 and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:26.390" style="s2">have nothing going on in life and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I would do either I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.390" end="00:42:31.819" style="s2">because it used to be let&#39;s say you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:33.290" style="s2">24 year old male you sort of had this</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.819" end="00:42:34.849" style="s2">idea of what you were gonna do you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.290" end="00:42:36.650" style="s2">gonna go to work you were gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.849" end="00:42:38.089" style="s2">wife you were gonna take care of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.650" end="00:42:39.710" style="s2">family and that would give you pride</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.089" end="00:42:43.250" style="s2">people would look at you and they would</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.710" end="00:42:45.500" style="s2">say you know Bob Jones takes care of his</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.250" end="00:42:47.660" style="s2">family he&#39;s 30 he works at the furniture</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.500" end="00:42:49.579" style="s2">store you know he&#39;s not some hotshot but</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.660" end="00:42:51.319" style="s2">he&#39;s taking care of his family and his</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.579" end="00:42:53.540" style="s2">kids right and that&#39;s meaningful I</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.319" end="00:42:55.549" style="s2">always think of the are you familiar</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.540" end="00:42:57.230" style="s2">with the show The Wonder Years you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.549" end="00:43:00.170" style="s2">kidding me when I was when I was growing</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.230" end="00:43:02.690" style="s2">up I was the same age as the characters</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.170" end="00:43:04.520" style="s2">when I was growing up oh okay awesome</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.690" end="00:43:06.950" style="s2">yeah so like I I mean you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.520" end="00:43:10.220" style="s2">interesting is I rewatched that not too</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.950" end="00:43:11.890" style="s2">long ago and this is how I know I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.220" end="00:43:14.559" style="s2">getting older is that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.890" end="00:43:17.900" style="s2">identify with the father around</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.559" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">but um what struck me is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.900" end="00:43:22.130" style="s2">dad in that show he was just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:23.930" style="s2">like some as far as you could tell you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.130" end="00:43:27.290" style="s2">something like manager like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.930" end="00:43:30.470" style="s2">Pyrrhic rad this there&#39;s no defense</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.290" end="00:43:32.150" style="s2">industry place I believe but he had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.470" end="00:43:33.950" style="s2">family and he took care of his family</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.150" end="00:43:36.349" style="s2">and he provided for them and that gave</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.950" end="00:43:38.210" style="s2">them meaning and dignity and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.349" end="00:43:40.309" style="s2">that&#39;s disappearing for people and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.210" end="00:43:42.710" style="s2">just don&#39;t know what to do with it and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.309" end="00:43:45.109" style="s2">think it&#39;s one of the problems is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.710" end="00:43:48.049" style="s2">people who are you know they&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.109" end="00:43:48.770" style="s2">for Vox or they&#39;re writing peer-reviewed</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.049" end="00:43:51.170" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.770" end="00:43:53.240" style="s2">in there in academia I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.170" end="00:43:55.490" style="s2">understand the problem because they</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.240" end="00:43:56.930" style="s2">don&#39;t need that kind of structure right</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.490" end="00:43:59.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not what they do they&#39;re their</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.930" end="00:44:00.890" style="s2">intellectuals they just read books when</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.420" end="00:44:03.050" style="s2">they&#39;re when they have free time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.890" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">like cool I can read a book a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.050" end="00:44:06.410" style="s2">people when they have free time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:08.180" style="s2">like cool I&#39;m gonna smoke five joints</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:12.530" style="s2">and play call of duty on there you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.180" end="00:44:13.600" style="s2">and that I don&#39;t think some people think</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.530" end="00:44:15.560" style="s2">that sounds like somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.600" end="00:44:17.540" style="s2">condescending or something but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.560" end="00:44:19.880" style="s2">mean it to I just think that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.540" end="00:44:21.830" style="s2">objectively true there&#39;s research on how</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.880" end="00:44:23.660" style="s2">people use their free time in the United</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.830" end="00:44:26.810" style="s2">States and it&#39;s not the way you think</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.660" end="00:44:29.060" style="s2">they should write even have leisure</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.810" end="00:44:31.010" style="s2">choices written down here in my in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.060" end="00:44:34.280" style="s2">notes from from your writing because</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.010" end="00:44:36.620" style="s2">it&#39;s such an important element and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.280" end="00:44:38.510" style="s2">comes with this thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.620" end="00:44:40.150" style="s2">cognitive divide that you mentioned can</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.510" end="00:44:45.140" style="s2">you can you talk about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.150" end="00:44:48.260" style="s2">yeah I mean so people such as Charles</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.140" end="00:44:50.570" style="s2">Marie really I mean Marie probably more</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.260" end="00:44:53.240" style="s2">than anybody drew attention to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.570" end="00:44:55.220" style="s2">that there&#39;s just this sort of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.240" end="00:44:56.750" style="s2">this is actually what the bell curve was</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.220" end="00:44:58.250" style="s2">about even though people think the bell</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.750" end="00:45:00.740" style="s2">curve and they immediately think raised</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.250" end="00:45:03.620" style="s2">it was really about intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.740" end="00:45:04.130" style="s2">class structure and in the in the United</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.620" end="00:45:06.770" style="s2">States</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.130" end="00:45:08.870" style="s2">and then he wrote coming apart which was</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.770" end="00:45:12.080" style="s2">more about that and the basic idea is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.870" end="00:45:15.470" style="s2">that American society has become really</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.080" end="00:45:17.960" style="s2">good at sorting people based on their</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.470" end="00:45:19.970" style="s2">cognitive capacities such that very</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.960" end="00:45:22.100" style="s2">intelligent people are sorting through</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.970" end="00:45:23.990" style="s2">this college machine they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.100" end="00:45:26.180" style="s2">elite universities and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.990" end="00:45:28.820" style="s2">they&#39;re you know living in these elite</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.180" end="00:45:31.670" style="s2">communities and people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.820" end="00:45:33.830" style="s2">cognitive elite unless even say people</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.670" end="00:45:35.600" style="s2">who are below average and intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.830" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">are getting left behind and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.600" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">sorting into their own group and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:43.340" style="s2">problem with this is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:47.150" style="s2">separate these groups one group thrives</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.340" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">in like this sort of world without with</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.150" end="00:45:51.230" style="s2">a lot of possibilities in leisure time</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:54.890" style="s2">the the cognitive elite the people with</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.230" end="00:45:57.020" style="s2">IQs 125 and above they are they do they</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.890" end="00:45:59.360" style="s2">read books they practice programming</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.020" end="00:46:01.120" style="s2">they teach themselves things they write</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.360" end="00:46:03.130" style="s2">articles whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.120" end="00:46:05.080" style="s2">they&#39;re thriving in it whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:07.450" style="s2">people who are let&#39;s say a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.080" end="00:46:11.050" style="s2">below but especially like 90 and below</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.450" end="00:46:13.030" style="s2">are fundamentally rootless because the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.050" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">institutions that used to give them</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.030" end="00:46:18.760" style="s2">meaning and provide structure for them</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:21.070" style="s2">are relentlessly attacked by these</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.760" end="00:46:23.290" style="s2">cognitive elites and I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.070" end="00:46:25.750" style="s2">it&#39;s important you know that it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.290" end="00:46:28.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.750" end="00:46:30.370" style="s2">ill-will from the cognitive elites it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.030" end="00:46:32.260" style="s2">they don&#39;t need the institution so they</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.370" end="00:46:34.750" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the point right so like</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.260" end="00:46:37.930" style="s2">for example religion and I and I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.750" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">not a believer personally but I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.930" end="00:46:42.340" style="s2">never been super sympathetic to like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:44.410" style="s2">new atheist but I was a little more</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.340" end="00:46:46.930" style="s2">militant in my atheism when I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.410" end="00:46:50.460" style="s2">younger and and now I think like I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.930" end="00:46:53.020" style="s2">see like the structure that religion</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.460" end="00:46:54.970" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t have the beliefs just</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.020" end="00:46:57.490" style="s2">going to a church and having a community</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.970" end="00:47:00.580" style="s2">with expectations and moral values is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.490" end="00:47:04.290" style="s2">really meaningful to people and right</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.580" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.290" end="00:47:08.710" style="s2">short-sighted and hubristic in a way to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">attack all of these institutions as</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.710" end="00:47:14.230" style="s2">backward simply because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:18.210" style="s2">provide anything for you as monogamy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.230" end="00:47:21.340" style="s2">another one that I think a lot about so</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.210" end="00:47:23.410" style="s2">it seems as though we&#39;re moving a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.340" end="00:47:28.270" style="s2">bit away from monogamy and especially</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.410" end="00:47:31.690" style="s2">elites I think I read about I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.270" end="00:47:35.080" style="s2">about tacky leads for example and their</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.690" end="00:47:37.720" style="s2">behavior I think maybe they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.080" end="00:47:39.730" style="s2">do polyamory maybe they are maybe these</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.720" end="00:47:42.520" style="s2">people can get away with it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.730" end="00:47:44.830" style="s2">think most people can and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.520" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">teaching this to people as though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.830" end="00:47:49.840" style="s2">viable option it&#39;s probably not I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:52.020" style="s2">again I&#39;m open to the evidence and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.840" end="00:47:54.670" style="s2">actually I&#39;ve had conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.020" end="00:47:57.580" style="s2">Jeffrey Miller or I think probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.670" end="00:48:00.040" style="s2">nothing on the process Oh awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.580" end="00:48:01.110" style="s2">yeah yeah so he&#39;s you know openly</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.040" end="00:48:03.960" style="s2">polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.110" end="00:48:05.730" style="s2">and he&#39;s talked about it and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.960" end="00:48:08.670" style="s2">conversations with him and I respect his</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.730" end="00:48:10.770" style="s2">views on it I just think I would be very</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.670" end="00:48:12.660" style="s2">cautious about promoting that because I</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.770" end="00:48:14.730" style="s2">think a lot of people think they can</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.660" end="00:48:17.160" style="s2">handle it and what it really means to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.730" end="00:48:20.030" style="s2">male as cool I get to have sex with like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.160" end="00:48:23.610" style="s2">more women and it&#39;s actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.030" end="00:48:26.070" style="s2">destructive to most relationships and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.610" end="00:48:28.320" style="s2">get to I mean I think Jordan Peterson in</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.070" end="00:48:30.840" style="s2">the idea of socially enforced monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.320" end="00:48:33.090" style="s2">there&#39;s something to that right people</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.840" end="00:48:35.790" style="s2">who hendrik for example they&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.090" end="00:48:37.650" style="s2">at societies and it&#39;s correlation also</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.790" end="00:48:41.430" style="s2">there are problems with it but there</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.650" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">seems to be a benefit to having socially</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.430" end="00:48:46.470" style="s2">enforcement alchemy it seems to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:49.770" style="s2">society function more smoothly it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.470" end="00:48:53.100" style="s2">reduces male-on-male competition for</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.770" end="00:48:55.170" style="s2">mates etc right right so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.100" end="00:48:57.180" style="s2">getting at it&#39;s like I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.170" end="00:49:01.880" style="s2">fair to say there&#39;s this subset of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.180" end="00:49:05.010" style="s2">cognitively leads who promote this very</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.880" end="00:49:08.460" style="s2">libertarian progressivism this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.010" end="00:49:11.310" style="s2">destruction of all narratives that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.460" end="00:49:13.980" style="s2">supposedly confining or constricting</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.310" end="00:49:16.110" style="s2">right sex rules religion whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.980" end="00:49:18.090" style="s2">that supposedly defines somebody in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.110" end="00:49:19.940" style="s2">rigid way they want to destroy it and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.090" end="00:49:23.580" style="s2">think they don&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.940" end="00:49:25.830" style="s2">destroying that means taking meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.580" end="00:49:27.810" style="s2">guidance away from a lot of people right</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.830" end="00:49:29.490" style="s2">right it&#39;s like you&#39;re standing on a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.810" end="00:49:31.560" style="s2">suspension bridge and you just do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.490" end="00:49:33.090" style="s2">don&#39;t know why that rope is hanging you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.560" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">know from the thing up there and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.090" end="00:49:37.380" style="s2">like hey let me cut this you&#39;ve got one</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:38.760" style="s2">and everything&#39;s okay you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.380" end="00:49:40.110" style="s2">cut another and you cut another and cut</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:42.420" style="s2">another before you know it you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.110" end="00:49:43.950" style="s2">cut that last one and your whole bridge</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.420" end="00:49:46.200" style="s2">is gonna come crashing down that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.950" end="00:49:48.780" style="s2">actually a really good analogy thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.200" end="00:49:51.690" style="s2">I like that except for to make it work</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.780" end="00:49:53.490" style="s2">it&#39;s even the elites are like held in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.690" end="00:49:55.560" style="s2">different areas so the ropes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.490" end="00:49:58.500" style="s2">cutting don&#39;t hold on to them they hold</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.560" end="00:50:00.390" style="s2">everybody else right so we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.500" end="00:50:02.220" style="s2">covered a whole lot of things here that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.390" end="00:50:03.600" style="s2">are personally important to me and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.220" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">things I&#39;ve been chewing on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.600" end="00:50:08.970" style="s2">personally I&#39;ve practiced some form of I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.450" end="00:50:12.810" style="s2">would call ethical non-monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.970" end="00:50:14.610" style="s2">over the last 10 years and I&#39;m doing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.810" end="00:50:16.320" style="s2">in a relationship in which you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.610" end="00:50:18.180" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna have children together</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.320" end="00:50:20.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve been together a long time but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.180" end="00:50:22.050" style="s2">already have children and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.250" end="00:50:24.180" style="s2">different you know different goals and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.050" end="00:50:26.100" style="s2">motivations than people who are coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.180" end="00:50:28.350" style="s2">together in their early 20s and seeking</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.100" end="00:50:31.770" style="s2">to form a family I would not recommend</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.350" end="00:50:34.110" style="s2">polyamory or open relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.770" end="00:50:36.270" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.110" end="00:50:39.300" style="s2">relationships have low you know sexual</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.270" end="00:50:41.790" style="s2">partner counts and are seeking to build</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.300" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">a long-term stable family unit like no</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.790" end="00:50:45.990" style="s2">you know like even Jeffrey Miller he has</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:49.080" style="s2">grown children like or at least one and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.990" end="00:50:50.460" style="s2">so like he has different motivations for</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.080" end="00:50:52.200" style="s2">his relationships and I would think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.460" end="00:50:56.130" style="s2">he will too would acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.200" end="00:51:00.060" style="s2">polyamory is about fringe is the work</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.130" end="00:51:01.980" style="s2">before it&#39;s that word that means not the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.060" end="00:51:04.740" style="s2">normal thing and it always sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.980" end="00:51:07.890" style="s2">bad word anyway I&#39;m getting cold um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.740" end="00:51:10.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a typic atypical yeah but whatever</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.890" end="00:51:12.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t know you know and and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.320" end="00:51:13.980" style="s2">just uh it&#39;s just by definition</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.420" end="00:51:15.330" style="s2">something that&#39;s on the fringe and not</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.980" end="00:51:17.370" style="s2">the best thing for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.330" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">sure and but now what I wonder about</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.370" end="00:51:20.970" style="s2">that is here&#39;s my like my question</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:24.060" style="s2">because I&#39;ve had this conversation a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.970" end="00:51:26.280" style="s2">and personally I&#39;m I think I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.060" end="00:51:28.590" style="s2">I have some conservative tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.280" end="00:51:30.180" style="s2">myself so I think monogamy is probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.590" end="00:51:33.900" style="s2">the best way to do it at least for me</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.180" end="00:51:37.380" style="s2">but although I can understand other you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.900" end="00:51:39.810" style="s2">know like I understand it guys I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.380" end="00:51:41.340" style="s2">just to me it&#39;s like using drugs so like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.810" end="00:51:43.410" style="s2">I think there are people who can use</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.340" end="00:51:45.300" style="s2">cocaine and they won&#39;t get addicted they</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.410" end="00:51:46.770" style="s2">use it Friday night they take a bump or</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.300" end="00:51:48.840" style="s2">something they feel good and it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.770" end="00:51:51.030" style="s2">for them I don&#39;t think you should</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.840" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">encourage it though right it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.030" end="00:51:54.420" style="s2">like where if you&#39;re a type of person</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:56.610" style="s2">who can handle it you&#39;ll probably figure</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.420" end="00:51:58.230" style="s2">it out there&#39;s no need to tell a society</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.610" end="00:52:00.230" style="s2">that hey we should be encouraging people</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.230" end="00:52:03.240" style="s2">to try coke because it&#39;s great right</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.230" end="00:52:05.640" style="s2">right that&#39;s how I think I feel about</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.240" end="00:52:07.410" style="s2">polyamory it&#39;s like look if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.640" end="00:52:09.600" style="s2">sort of stumble into or you figure it</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.410" end="00:52:11.910" style="s2">out or whatever okay cool but like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.600" end="00:52:14.140" style="s2">don&#39;t think we want to mainstream though</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.910" end="00:52:15.849" style="s2">no definitely not and even as I</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.140" end="00:52:18.609" style="s2">written about ethical non-monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.849" end="00:52:20.529" style="s2">plenty I still have II added it with</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.609" end="00:52:22.420" style="s2">like this really doesn&#39;t apply to most</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.529" end="00:52:24.670" style="s2">of you are in fact you know this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.420" end="00:52:29.049" style="s2">related so move along now</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.670" end="00:52:31.829" style="s2">but intro but but it also all this is we</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.049" end="00:52:33.970" style="s2">talked about this earlier about changing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.829" end="00:52:35.470" style="s2">psychological characteristics and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.970" end="00:52:39.039" style="s2">what the best kind of society would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.470" end="00:52:41.500" style="s2">and then talking about how these the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.039" end="00:52:43.240" style="s2">Continental groups you know races or</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.500" end="00:52:44.769" style="s2">however you want to describe them have</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.240" end="00:52:46.029" style="s2">slightly different makeups and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.769" end="00:52:47.650" style="s2">therefore maybe I&#39;m slightly from</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.029" end="00:52:49.569" style="s2">culture Society and taste the preference</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.650" end="00:52:51.730" style="s2">and whatnot and then we started talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.569" end="00:52:54.849" style="s2">about well would that apply in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.730" end="00:52:56.680" style="s2">strata within within those groups right</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.849" end="00:52:59.380" style="s2">and then now and then we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.680" end="00:53:01.750" style="s2">again here about this is good for me but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.380" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not good for everybody else right</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.750" end="00:53:06.609" style="s2">and then so then I keep thinking all</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:09.579" style="s2">right well man I&#39;m starting to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.609" end="00:53:12.430" style="s2">you know this is for me and that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.579" end="00:53:15.970" style="s2">you and it sounds so condescending and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.430" end="00:53:18.130" style="s2">it sounds I know like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.970" end="00:53:20.349" style="s2">corrupt power-hungry guy who&#39;s in charge</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.130" end="00:53:21.640" style="s2">who&#39;s like this is like now I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.349" end="00:53:23.319" style="s2">charge I&#39;m gonna have a thousand wives</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.640" end="00:53:24.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna do all these things and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.319" end="00:53:26.859" style="s2">won&#39;t matter and I can do coke um Friday</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.730" end="00:53:30.339" style="s2">nights cuz you can&#39;t and a lot a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.859" end="00:53:31.930" style="s2">you know drugs one wife go to work this</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.339" end="00:53:34.470" style="s2">is what we need for society and culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.930" end="00:53:37.599" style="s2">and it makes me feel like a bad person</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.470" end="00:53:40.809" style="s2">but like I don&#39;t know does the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">suggest that that maybe there should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.809" end="00:53:44.950" style="s2">and are and always will be I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">Epstein thing you know throws another</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.950" end="00:53:51.250" style="s2">wrench in this sort of what are what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:53.309" style="s2">the expectations of us as humans and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.250" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">where do we find meaning based on our</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.309" end="00:54:01.420" style="s2">class level or rayon or IQ or or what</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:03.670" style="s2">right right so that I mean so so much</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.420" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">there that way you you I mean you could</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.670" end="00:54:07.750" style="s2">write thousands of pages on this and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.680" end="00:54:09.369" style="s2">would still be interesting right but one</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.750" end="00:54:13.089" style="s2">thing I was thinking about what that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.369" end="00:54:16.299" style="s2">that is kind of why I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.089" end="00:54:19.109" style="s2">tendency for the elite in societies to</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.299" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">live a kind of debarked life that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.109" end="00:54:25.029" style="s2">rather repellent to ordinary people you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:27.910" style="s2">know this is kind of a theme in history</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.029" end="00:54:30.560" style="s2">and like I feel this way when I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.910" end="00:54:32.750" style="s2">they had something they called like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.560" end="00:54:35.810" style="s2">think they called him cuddle puddles I</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.750" end="00:54:37.340" style="s2">was reading this book about the I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.810" end="00:54:39.230" style="s2">it was a woman from the tech just</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.340" end="00:54:41.600" style="s2">talking about sort of bro culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.230" end="00:54:43.220" style="s2">tech industry and like it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.600" end="00:54:45.080" style="s2">something I was I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.220" end="00:54:46.820" style="s2">unsympathetic to because I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.080" end="00:54:48.950" style="s2">it&#39;s just another thing about how these</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.820" end="00:54:50.600" style="s2">people are so Sauk says but it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.950" end="00:54:52.810" style="s2">actually I mean it maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.600" end="00:54:55.400" style="s2">exaggerated and some of the claims were</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.810" end="00:54:57.610" style="s2">neither here nor there but there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.400" end="00:55:01.360" style="s2">something i opening about just the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.610" end="00:55:04.190" style="s2">degeneracy the decadence of these just</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.360" end="00:55:07.970" style="s2">immensely wealthy humans in like than</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.190" end="00:55:10.430" style="s2">just hypocrisy right you know and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.970" end="00:55:14.090" style="s2">strikes me that there should be maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.430" end="00:55:16.130" style="s2">some moral discipline among people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.090" end="00:55:19.580" style="s2">are lucky enough to be the elites and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.130" end="00:55:22.220" style="s2">society and no I don&#39;t think that means</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.580" end="00:55:24.320" style="s2">like I do think like look if it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.220" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">because I&#39;m almost recommending if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.320" end="00:55:30.470" style="s2">can have a bump of coke on Friday hide</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:35.420" style="s2">it from people so I&#39;m almost advising</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.470" end="00:55:38.150" style="s2">hypocrisy to some degree but I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.420" end="00:55:40.100" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s Jordan Peterson&#39;s take on</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.150" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">this is kind of noble like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.100" end="00:55:45.620" style="s2">Dwayne the rock Johnson like do every</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:48.860" style="s2">dude a good deed and like stay with one</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.620" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">woman man you know like discipline</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.860" end="00:55:54.110" style="s2">yourself and leave some for the rest</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:56.540" style="s2">basically yeah exactly exactly and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.110" end="00:55:59.060" style="s2">mean it sounds and I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.540" end="00:56:02.360" style="s2">make women sound like resources but they</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.060" end="00:56:04.910" style="s2">click a heart and and in summary forever</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.360" end="00:56:06.770" style="s2">yeah yeah like right exactly so in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.910" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">way you can think of it that way right</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.770" end="00:56:13.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s like if Bill Gates has six</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.780" end="00:56:15.740" style="s2">hundred wives then that&#39;s 599 fewer for</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.220" end="00:56:18.140" style="s2">other people right and so which is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.740" end="00:56:21.050" style="s2">exact thinking behind the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.140" end="00:56:25.910" style="s2">culturally enforced monogamy right is</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.050" end="00:56:29.000" style="s2">that in a world left up to pure you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.910" end="00:56:30.770" style="s2">sexual dominance and you know for lack</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.000" end="00:56:33.140" style="s2">of better terms alpha males like</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.770" end="00:56:35.230" style="s2">acquiring all the mating partners and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.140" end="00:56:38.600" style="s2">you&#39;re going to run left with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.230" end="00:56:39.470" style="s2">destabilizing force of you know Maitlis</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.600" end="00:56:41.720" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.470" end="00:56:44.300" style="s2">yes exactly that&#39;s exactly right you</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.720" end="00:56:47.450" style="s2">know what&#39;s interesting is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.300" end="00:56:50.300" style="s2">this relates to economic redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.450" end="00:56:51.619" style="s2">and this is why I find so I find it</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.300" end="00:56:54.109" style="s2">interesting because people have</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.619" end="00:56:55.550" style="s2">contradictions views on these often but</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.109" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">they&#39;re really the same thing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.550" end="00:57:01.579" style="s2">if you have too much economic if the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:04.130" style="s2">economic distribution is is to disparate</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.579" end="00:57:06.970" style="s2">right it&#39;s it it causes it destabilizes</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.130" end="00:57:08.510" style="s2">thing correct you know you can say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.970" end="00:57:10.910" style="s2">libertarianism and this is how the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.510" end="00:57:12.920" style="s2">market allocates it I don&#39;t care if</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.910" end="00:57:15.079" style="s2">people feel as though you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.920" end="00:57:17.300" style="s2">billion dollars and they&#39;ve got not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.079" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">lot they&#39;re gonna be angry about it you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.300" end="00:57:21.950" style="s2">know and then same thing if you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:24.560" style="s2">five beautiful women and they have none</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.950" end="00:57:26.150" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna be happy right right</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.560" end="00:57:28.250" style="s2">and and with the mating to I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.150" end="00:57:29.780" style="s2">it goes even beyond them just being</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.250" end="00:57:32.329" style="s2">upset I mean at least in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.780" end="00:57:34.460" style="s2">understanding is that you know married</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.329" end="00:57:36.980" style="s2">men with a partner much far more</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.460" end="00:57:38.990" style="s2">productive economically and safer and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.980" end="00:57:41.180" style="s2">saner and healthy they also have like</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.990" end="00:57:42.920" style="s2">lower their they&#39;re much less yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.180" end="00:57:46.130" style="s2">they&#39;re less violent they don&#39;t commit</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.920" end="00:57:49.130" style="s2">crimes especially having children also</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.130" end="00:57:50.630" style="s2">disciplines men yeah which is which I</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.130" end="00:57:52.369" style="s2">think I&#39;ve picked up on the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.630" end="00:57:55.910" style="s2">contradiction that you alluded to before</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.369" end="00:57:57.800" style="s2">which is on making sweeping</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.910" end="00:57:59.869" style="s2">generalizations here but on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.800" end="00:58:02.420" style="s2">progressive and people who even veer</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.869" end="00:58:04.490" style="s2">towards like collectivist tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.420" end="00:58:06.890" style="s2">like some of the most liberal sexual</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.490" end="00:58:09.710" style="s2">practice yes and so and so they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.890" end="00:58:11.810" style="s2">super super market oriented when it</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.710" end="00:58:14.619" style="s2">comes to sexual practices right and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.810" end="00:58:17.270" style="s2">then you get the Conservatives who are</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.619" end="00:58:19.640" style="s2">want to be super liberal with their</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.270" end="00:58:22.430" style="s2">market policies but then yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.640" end="00:58:25.160" style="s2">sexually want to do exactly like every</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.430" end="00:58:28.520" style="s2">monogamy distribution sexual recess</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.160" end="00:58:30.020" style="s2">which makes me what makes me wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.520" end="00:58:32.060" style="s2">either one of those is like an</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.020" end="00:58:34.069" style="s2">organizing first principle because if</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.060" end="00:58:35.079" style="s2">you can contradict it and this versus</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.069" end="00:58:38.150" style="s2">that then maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.079" end="00:58:40.819" style="s2">and then just also just it provides for</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.150" end="00:58:43.069" style="s2">like endless endless laughs and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.819" end="00:58:46.730" style="s2">discussions and just consideration I</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.069" end="00:58:49.369" style="s2">mean again I I went to George Mason for</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.730" end="00:58:52.550" style="s2">economics so I&#39;m well steeped in</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.369" end="00:58:52.800" style="s2">libertarian education I&#39;ve shaken a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.550" end="00:58:55.950" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.800" end="00:58:57.870" style="s2">out of my system over time that happened</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.950" end="00:58:59.580" style="s2">also when I went to Georgetown for grad</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.870" end="00:59:01.200" style="s2">school for International Affairs so like</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.580" end="00:59:04.290" style="s2">I got really I got I got both ends of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:05.820" style="s2">the perspective maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.290" end="00:59:09.390" style="s2">heterodox an interesting person to talk</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.820" end="00:59:11.340" style="s2">to and so and I&#39;ve been struggling and</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.390" end="00:59:14.700" style="s2">this is sort of tying it back to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.340" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">question that we penned the process or</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.700" end="00:59:20.580" style="s2">the outcome and I and as I I see sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:23.810" style="s2">the takedowns of libertarianism</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.580" end="00:59:27.060" style="s2">happening and this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.810" end="00:59:29.970" style="s2">adherence to the markets as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.060" end="00:59:32.130" style="s2">religion or sort of mystical force or</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.970" end="00:59:35.670" style="s2">Heyford yeah and whatever the outcome is</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.130" end="00:59:37.620" style="s2">the good and then and then looking at</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.670" end="00:59:39.390" style="s2">like my individual freedom and liberty</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.620" end="00:59:41.160" style="s2">and others individual freedoms and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.390" end="00:59:43.710" style="s2">liberties and then thinking alright well</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.160" end="00:59:46.830" style="s2">how do we get to what&#39;s best for the end</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.710" end="00:59:49.470" style="s2">and is is the you know Adam Smith stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.830" end="00:59:51.930" style="s2">is that is that dying I mean art I hear</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.470" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">conservatives Republicans sort of Mogga</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.930" end="00:59:57.000" style="s2">types talking sort of in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:59.160" style="s2">socialism and like you know ending</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.000" end="01:00:01.800" style="s2">taking the endowments from colleges and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.160" end="01:00:03.270" style="s2">and populist thinking combined yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.800" end="01:00:05.450" style="s2">conservative thinking which is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.270" end="01:00:08.220" style="s2">necessarily libertarian thinking and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.450" end="01:00:10.320" style="s2">have been I&#39;ve never been less anchored</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.220" end="01:00:13.170" style="s2">I think than I am right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.320" end="01:00:17.430" style="s2">he&#39;s quite funds I&#39;m very on in credit</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.170" end="01:00:19.140" style="s2">to myself I was not there so interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.430" end="01:00:21.060" style="s2">I would say about Adam Smith right is</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.140" end="01:00:23.820" style="s2">it&#39;s important to put Adam Smith in his</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.060" end="01:00:27.120" style="s2">time right Adam Smith is writing in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.820" end="01:00:29.430" style="s2">completely different environment from</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.120" end="01:00:31.920" style="s2">the one that we inhabit as I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.430" end="01:00:34.470" style="s2">people you know people Brielle Adam</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.920" end="01:00:37.050" style="s2">Smith this Adams with that the the there</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.470" end="01:00:39.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t concentrated corporate power and</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.050" end="01:00:42.390" style="s2">Adam Smith stay the way that there is no</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.720" end="01:00:46.770" style="s2">right he did it no there&#39;s nothing like</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.390" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2">it so it&#39;s you know I I&#39;m skeptical and</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.770" end="01:00:52.350" style="s2">cautious about organized power in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:55.590" style="s2">general yeah but sometimes is useful and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.350" end="01:00:59.010" style="s2">I&#39;m very skeptical of libertarianism</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.590" end="01:01:00.359" style="s2">let&#39;s see I just I&#39;ve never found the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.010" end="01:01:03.299" style="s2">idea of Liberty</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.359" end="01:01:06.739" style="s2">so I mean not maybe when I was 19 I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.299" end="01:01:10.140" style="s2">I was kind of libertarian ask but just</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.739" end="01:01:13.019" style="s2">it&#39;s very unpersuasive to me I&#39;ll put it</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.140" end="01:01:14.819" style="s2">that way no give your point about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.019" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">contradictions really interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.819" end="01:01:18.480" style="s2">think about though with the sexual thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">I actually almost want to kind of hold a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.480" end="01:01:22.619" style="s2">not let&#39;s do it because the thing you</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:26.460" style="s2">said and I was thinking the exact thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.619" end="01:01:30.779" style="s2">you said so progressives tend to be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.460" end="01:01:34.349" style="s2">very redistributionist about resources</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.779" end="01:01:37.259" style="s2">economic resources but then very liberal</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.349" end="01:01:40.950" style="s2">about sexual behavior in fact so liberal</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.259" end="01:01:43.109" style="s2">that they many of them openly promote</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.950" end="01:01:44.730" style="s2">some sort of non-monogamy and this goes</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.109" end="01:01:46.559" style="s2">all the way back to the hippies right</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.730" end="01:01:48.809" style="s2">with the idea i remember in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.559" end="01:01:52.170" style="s2">a Wonder Years character and they say</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.809" end="01:01:54.599" style="s2">like the idea of like you know of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.170" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">marriage is like it&#39;s like you&#39;re owning</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.599" end="01:01:59.249" style="s2">somebody and that&#39;s like bad right</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">there&#39;s just this idea of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.249" end="01:02:05.249" style="s2">ownership but it&#39;s it contradicts the to</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.549" style="s2">contradict but I think the reason</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.249" end="01:02:11.059" style="s2">progressives don&#39;t see that is because</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.549" end="01:02:14.339" style="s2">they think that it&#39;s wrong to think of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.059" end="01:02:16.759" style="s2">sexual of women as in some sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.339" end="01:02:21.059" style="s2">sexual resource right they view that as</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.759" end="01:02:24.390" style="s2">demeaning and objectifying women but</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.059" end="01:02:26.369" style="s2">what they&#39;re not seeing is that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.390" end="01:02:29.190" style="s2">same thing with economic redistribution</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.369" end="01:02:32.430" style="s2">you&#39;re taking money from somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.190" end="01:02:35.309" style="s2">right right it&#39;s not as like I really do</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.430" end="01:02:36.989" style="s2">think this and I&#39;ve had the same I can</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.309" end="01:02:39.989" style="s2">criticize myself because I&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.989" end="01:02:42.569" style="s2">thoughts to you it&#39;s hard did you think</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.989" end="01:02:44.730" style="s2">about the fact that when you tax you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.569" end="01:02:46.140" style="s2">taking money from other people right and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.730" end="01:02:47.819" style="s2">you know I think progressives don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.140" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">think about that so they don&#39;t see they</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.819" end="01:02:51.480" style="s2">just see it as like the government&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:53.940" style="s2">more money to redistribute right know</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.480" end="01:02:56.190" style="s2">that money is coming from the worker or</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.940" end="01:02:59.009" style="s2">from somebody else and that&#39;s taking me</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.190" end="01:03:01.499" style="s2">from them now I&#39;m ok with that because I</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.009" end="01:03:04.380" style="s2">I care about the outcome and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.499" end="01:03:07.010" style="s2">outcomes better for everybody when we</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.380" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have too much economic any</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.010" end="01:03:11.540" style="s2">quality and we don&#39;t have too much</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:17.450" style="s2">sexual inequality right right like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.540" end="01:03:21.320" style="s2">never you know like people Hollywood</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.450" end="01:03:23.630" style="s2">celebrities are going to have very wild</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.320" end="01:03:25.280" style="s2">sex lives relative to most of us</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.630" end="01:03:27.620" style="s2">right and that&#39;s okay we can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.280" end="01:03:31.790" style="s2">deal with that but if if they start if</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.620" end="01:03:33.860" style="s2">you know Brad Pitt gets to marry 35</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.790" end="01:03:35.360" style="s2">people at the same time and Bill Gates</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.700" end="01:03:41.960" style="s2">problems yes and and on the conservative</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.310" end="01:03:44.390" style="s2">side you&#39;re right like there used to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.960" end="01:03:46.730" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re right about populism</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.390" end="01:03:49.160" style="s2">the Paul Ryan wing of the Republican</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.730" end="01:03:51.890" style="s2">Party is just dying right now it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.160" end="01:03:53.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s disappearing it&#39;s more a bond</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.890" end="01:03:57.080" style="s2">right now and it&#39;s going to die soon and</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.930" end="01:03:59.120" style="s2">I&#39;m you know I&#39;m happy about that I I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:04:01.700" end="01:04:08.090" style="s2">future a more populist nationalist but</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.530" end="01:04:09.980" style="s2">less boorish because that&#39;s my problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.090" end="01:04:12.140" style="s2">with Trump as you said I think you</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.980" end="01:04:14.420" style="s2">sucked it up and you vote I mean I guess</p>

<p begin="01:04:19.280" end="01:04:26.900" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t able to get past the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.560" end="01:04:30.110" style="s2">crudeness and I don&#39;t that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.900" end="01:04:34.550" style="s2">sensibility issue but I I really I worry</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.110" end="01:04:36.560" style="s2">about it&#39;s a fact on I worry about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.550" end="01:04:38.750" style="s2">divisiveness about turning everything</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.560" end="01:04:41.270" style="s2">into some divisive issue that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.750" end="01:04:42.970" style="s2">didn&#39;t like so I just like an example of</p>

<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:49.730" style="s2">would rather people stood for the anthem</p>

<p begin="01:04:56.750" end="01:05:01.370" style="s2">that divides people but that&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="01:05:16.280" end="01:05:21.410" style="s2">a more unifying message about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.010" end="01:05:26.450" style="s2">gonna take care of each other more or</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.410" end="01:05:28.930" style="s2">less markets are cool but less like free</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.450" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">market is everything a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.930" end="01:05:34.850" style="s2">redistribution but also more nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:36.650" style="s2">more America first restricted</p>

<p begin="01:05:36.650" end="01:05:42.140" style="s2">vision of the Republican Party that I</p>

<p begin="01:05:42.140" end="01:05:46.700" style="s2">becoming so on board I&#39;m gonna vote</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.750" end="01:05:49.220" style="s2">Republican pretty soon I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.700" end="01:05:51.770" style="s2">can vote for Trump right but if you gave</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.220" end="01:05:55.130" style="s2">me a populist Marco Rubio I would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.770" end="01:05:58.340" style="s2">voting for him in 2020 right right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.130" end="01:06:00.230" style="s2">fascinating a lot of a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.340" end="01:06:02.510" style="s2">held their nose and pulled the trigger</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.230" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">for Trump and I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.510" end="01:06:08.030" style="s2">mainstream media gets the whole story</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:11.930" style="s2">wrong they tributing the white non</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.030" end="01:06:14.570" style="s2">college male who did actually vote for</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.930" end="01:06:16.100" style="s2">Trump in large numbers but those those</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.570" end="01:06:18.800" style="s2">people would have voted for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.100" end="01:06:20.210" style="s2">candidate had the are next to them like</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.800" end="01:06:22.790" style="s2">yes there&#39;s just no question about it</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.210" end="01:06:24.590" style="s2">right the the group that they need to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.790" end="01:06:26.810" style="s2">looking at and of course I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.590" end="01:06:29.300" style="s2">written a book about it it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.810" end="01:06:32.330" style="s2">people that were Democrats and who made</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.300" end="01:06:34.400" style="s2">a conscious decision to like step off</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.330" end="01:06:37.130" style="s2">and away from the Democratic Party and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.400" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">to step into what is by all accounts</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.130" end="01:06:41.860" style="s2">without you know a difficult thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:45.320" style="s2">which is you know at times to defend or</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.860" end="01:06:47.390" style="s2">you know support Donald Trump but made a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.320" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">very conscious decision to do it and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.390" end="01:06:50.690" style="s2">then all the reasons why which are</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:52.040" style="s2">basically all the things that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.690" end="01:06:55.130" style="s2">talking about here today</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.040" end="01:06:58.250" style="s2">right so did you vote for just to get</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.130" end="01:07:01.940" style="s2">did you vote for Obama I sure did okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.250" end="01:07:04.670" style="s2">in 2008 and 2012 I sure did okay and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.940" end="01:07:06.920" style="s2">it was for you was it mostly like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.670" end="01:07:09.650" style="s2">sort of like woke Miss and progressivism</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.920" end="01:07:11.660" style="s2">that yes I mean I you needed yeah I tie</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.650" end="01:07:17.090" style="s2">it back you know I can see very clearly</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.660" end="01:07:21.860" style="s2">like changes in title nine changes</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.090" end="01:07:23.960" style="s2">and the rise of intersectionality then</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.860" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">as well just like all the things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.960" end="01:07:27.170" style="s2">been talking about here about sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:29.990" style="s2">the decline and the attack on sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.170" end="01:07:32.630" style="s2">our Western ideals and the basis for our</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.990" end="01:07:36.950" style="s2">civilization and whatnot and and then to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.630" end="01:07:40.250" style="s2">know that the tyranny of the minority</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.950" end="01:07:43.100" style="s2">right so like if if we if we vote for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.250" end="01:07:44.810" style="s2">Democrat then all the institutions the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.100" end="01:07:46.280" style="s2">Department of Education everybody is</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.810" end="01:07:48.620" style="s2">going to be staffed by these people</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.280" end="01:07:51.080" style="s2">looks good and then and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.620" end="01:07:53.930" style="s2">gonna affect you know systemic change</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.080" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">through stroke to the pen like case in</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.930" end="01:07:57.110" style="s2">point title nine yeah that was</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:07:59.960" style="s2">disastrous</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.110" end="01:08:01.220" style="s2">I totally agree with that and I here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.960" end="01:08:04.490" style="s2">the question would you vote for Obama</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.220" end="01:08:06.200" style="s2">again if he were running no okay no</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.490" end="01:08:08.090" style="s2">because at this point you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.200" end="01:08:10.490" style="s2">looking to what the woke nurse is too</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.090" end="01:08:13.310" style="s2">feverish in the Democratic Party and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.490" end="01:08:15.110" style="s2">know I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t couldn&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.310" end="01:08:17.630" style="s2">for any Democrat really yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.110" end="01:08:19.310" style="s2">because of their coalition right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.630" end="01:08:21.770" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s what I worry about too is</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.310" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">because like I&#39;d like to think I could</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.770" end="01:08:27.170" style="s2">vote for Biden but I don&#39;t like their</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:29.210" style="s2">coalition yeah their coalition I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.170" end="01:08:31.640" style="s2">afraid of their coalition yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.210" end="01:08:35.420" style="s2">especially are they in their coalition</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.640" end="01:08:38.720" style="s2">hates you dude well there&#39;s I mean did</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.420" end="01:08:39.620" style="s2">you see the the bado O&#39;Rourke speech the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.720" end="01:08:42.050" style="s2">last one</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.620" end="01:08:43.880" style="s2">no I tuned I tuned all that crap out</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.050" end="01:08:45.859" style="s2">really at this point I do like to catch</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.880" end="01:08:48.800" style="s2">some headlines but they do I don&#39;t blame</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.859" end="01:08:51.800" style="s2">you but it was basically a America was</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.800" end="01:08:54.140" style="s2">founded on racism it&#39;s it&#39;s a thoroughly</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.800" end="01:08:56.390" style="s2">racist country and it&#39;s still racing I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.140" end="01:08:59.690" style="s2">mean it&#39;s just this yes you know in its</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.390" end="01:09:01.580" style="s2">leak America has had problems with</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.690" end="01:09:04.339" style="s2">racism in the same way every other</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.580" end="01:09:07.400" style="s2">country has but like this notion that</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.339" end="01:09:09.859" style="s2">everything that&#39;s American is the way it</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.400" end="01:09:13.880" style="s2">is because of racism is totally bogus</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.859" end="01:09:16.490" style="s2">right it&#39;s just it&#39;s divisive it&#39;s bogus</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.880" end="01:09:19.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just ridiculous and yeah white men</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.490" end="01:09:21.440" style="s2">are fleeing the Democratic Party because</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.130" end="01:09:23.300" style="s2">the Democratic Party quite explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.440" end="01:09:26.120" style="s2">asserts they don&#39;t like white males</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.300" end="01:09:27.950" style="s2">correct yeah how can how can you vote</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.120" end="01:09:29.739" style="s2">for a coalition that wants to see you</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.950" end="01:09:32.770" style="s2">destroy it basically they</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.739" end="01:09:35.199" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve written a lot about this</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.770" end="01:09:37.779" style="s2">and I&#39;ve thought very very carefully and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:39.670" style="s2">you know the core of intersectionality</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.779" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">which now is basically like the new</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.670" end="01:09:44.799" style="s2">moral code of the progressive left</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:46.659" style="s2">identic identifying everyone by</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.799" end="01:09:48.489" style="s2">oppressor and oppressed and then the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.659" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">various different levels of oppression</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.489" end="01:09:54.159" style="s2">and of right of course the intersection</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:57.550" style="s2">of all of all of those things and and in</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.159" end="01:10:00.130" style="s2">in kimberlé crenshaw is like watershed</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.550" end="01:10:01.449" style="s2">paper on on intersectionality she says</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.130" end="01:10:03.310" style="s2">right there she says you know white male</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.449" end="01:10:06.790" style="s2">power is implicit and understood it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.310" end="01:10:09.040" style="s2">like that is the the moral and religious</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.790" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">core of the progressive left and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.040" end="01:10:14.440" style="s2">resistance and right in you know to them</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:16.690" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m interrupting I think this</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.440" end="01:10:18.750" style="s2">is a good a good point and something</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.690" end="01:10:21.670" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking is that like Anglo</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.750" end="01:10:24.310" style="s2">society to them is white male power</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.670" end="01:10:26.469" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s my problem with it</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.310" end="01:10:29.530" style="s2">because what they&#39;re identifying is it</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.469" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">in my opinion white male power its Anglo</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.530" end="01:10:34.770" style="s2">society and yes Anglo society is</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:37.239" style="s2">predominantly white but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.770" end="01:10:40.090" style="s2">exclusively white and it&#39;s actually gone</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.239" end="01:10:42.730" style="s2">out of its way to allow people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.090" end="01:10:44.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t white full citizenship in our</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.730" end="01:10:48.190" style="s2">society and that that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.650" end="01:10:49.570" style="s2">boggles my mind is just the United</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.190" end="01:10:51.070" style="s2">States look we&#39;ll just stick with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.570" end="01:10:55.960" style="s2">United States and call it an Anglo</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.070" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">society because it basically is is it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.960" end="01:11:03.429" style="s2">has gone out of its way to be decent to</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:05.590" style="s2">people who are not white right like bend</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.429" end="01:11:07.449" style="s2">over it not look like obviously there</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.590" end="01:11:09.730" style="s2">are sins in the history of the United</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.449" end="01:11:11.830" style="s2">States nobody is trying to pretend that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.730" end="01:11:14.739" style="s2">slavery was a good thing to my knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.830" end="01:11:18.340" style="s2">and nobody&#39;s saying Jim Crow was awesome</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.739" end="01:11:21.130" style="s2">but at this point we are like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.340" end="01:11:23.620" style="s2">most tolerant countries and one of the</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.239" end="01:12:22.010" style="s2">you do like searches on Google search of</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.630" end="01:12:24.500" style="s2">terms for like intersectionality and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.010" end="01:12:27.620" style="s2">whatnot it&#39;s just some skyrockets like</p>

<p begin="01:12:36.679" end="01:12:41.000" style="s2">Campbell excuse me the victims culture</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.690" end="01:12:42.860" style="s2">had been Oh have you read that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.000" end="01:12:43.880" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s kind of the same thing as</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.860" end="01:12:45.860" style="s2">when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.880" end="01:12:47.480" style="s2">intersectionality which I know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.860" end="01:12:49.969" style="s2">read about intersectionality I just</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.480" end="01:12:51.440" style="s2">ignore those debates but it&#39;s it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.969" end="01:12:54.650" style="s2">of the same thing it says sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.440" end="01:12:57.020" style="s2">reverse hierarchy of victimhood right so</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.650" end="01:12:58.909" style="s2">like what is they feel as though white</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.020" end="01:13:00.350" style="s2">males are the most privileged therefore</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.909" end="01:13:02.420" style="s2">they&#39;re the lowest on the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.350" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">they&#39;re the least deserving and we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.420" end="01:13:08.390" style="s2">mock them and ridicule them and what</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:11.150" style="s2">would it be like black people who are</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.390" end="01:13:13.159" style="s2">disabled and transgendered would be at</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.150" end="01:13:15.290" style="s2">the top of this because they&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.159" end="01:13:17.300" style="s2">oppressed and I guess the logic of</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.290" end="01:13:19.670" style="s2">intersectionality is each one of these</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.300" end="01:13:23.480" style="s2">things adds to their oppression oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.670" end="01:13:26.150" style="s2">okay interactions and don&#39;t you think</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.480" end="01:13:28.429" style="s2">this is what I think and and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.150" end="01:13:30.920" style="s2">unfortunate thing is that this teaches</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.429" end="01:13:35.420" style="s2">people to be victims and like oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.920" end="01:13:37.130" style="s2">yes I like I look like Denzel Washington</p>

<p begin="01:18:04.909" end="01:18:10.490" style="s2">into emergent Network warfare basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.449" end="01:18:14.750" style="s2">and so what&#39;s the idea behind</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.490" end="01:18:17.300" style="s2">the idea is that the marshall mcluhan a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.750" end="01:18:19.370" style="s2">while back wrote that the the third</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.300" end="01:18:21.710" style="s2">world war would see the blurring of</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.370" end="01:18:24.110" style="s2">lines between civilian and military and</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.710" end="01:18:25.910" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s possible that that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.110" end="01:18:28.450" style="s2">happened now not in the third world war</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.910" end="01:18:31.670" style="s2">but here in aus cold you know civil war</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.450" end="01:18:33.080" style="s2">where you have the eyes these ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.670" end="01:18:35.540" style="s2">are emerging and these are these are</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.080" end="01:18:37.640" style="s2">collectives the networks without without</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.540" end="01:18:40.070" style="s2">like clear leadership right right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.640" end="01:18:41.990" style="s2">so and so they&#39;re emerging and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.070" end="01:18:43.760" style="s2">engaging in this on online conflict</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.990" end="01:18:45.740" style="s2">already and I personally myself have</p>

<p begin="01:21:33.070" end="01:21:36.520" style="s2">really Terry it&#39;s like backwards and um</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.570" end="01:21:40.800" style="s2">it is it really is it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.520" end="01:21:45.190" style="s2">isn&#39;t it because it is like the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.800" end="01:21:50.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a reactionary regressive</p>

<p begin="01:21:50.710" end="01:21:57.040" style="s2">that&#39;s like again it&#39;s it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.270" end="01:22:00.790" style="s2">moral fanaticism that is really</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.040" end="01:22:03.190" style="s2">unfortunate and don&#39;t like their to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.790" end="01:22:05.170" style="s2">clear and I think it&#39;s important to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.190" end="01:22:06.640" style="s2">fair to some people there are people who</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.170" end="01:22:07.900" style="s2">are progressive who are perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.640" end="01:22:10.060" style="s2">reasonable right</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.900" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">yes and and they I have progressive</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.060" end="01:22:15.100" style="s2">friends probably probably most but yeah</p>

<p begin="01:22:15.100" end="01:22:19.930" style="s2">I have protracted debates with them and</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.470" end="01:22:21.070" style="s2">it&#39;s fun and they disagree with me and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.930" end="01:22:23.020" style="s2">disagree with them and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.070" end="01:22:26.350" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how we should do things</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.020" end="01:22:28.390" style="s2">that&#39;s legitimate online debate what we</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.350" end="01:22:30.750" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be doing is daxing people</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.390" end="01:22:33.700" style="s2">right getting them suspended in fine</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.750" end="01:22:36.400" style="s2">calling people names calling for their</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.700" end="01:22:39.070" style="s2">jobs you how many people I&#39;ve had say</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.400" end="01:22:41.020" style="s2">how do you have a job at a college how</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.070" end="01:22:42.640" style="s2">does a college employee you and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.020" end="01:22:44.380" style="s2">worried that they&#39;re gonna send an email</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.640" end="01:22:47.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna be that you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.380" end="01:22:48.970" style="s2">mean yeah right and that that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.080" end="01:22:52.210" style="s2">we hit that&#39;s not how we should handle</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.970" end="01:22:53.980" style="s2">things right no well of course it sort</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.210" end="01:22:55.780" style="s2">of reveals the fundamental contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.980" end="01:22:57.940" style="s2">and then diversity arguments which is</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.780" end="01:23:00.670" style="s2">they did know diversity of opinion</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.940" end="01:23:02.080" style="s2">notably aunt right right diversity is</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.670" end="01:23:04.270" style="s2">cool if we all agree on like</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.080" end="01:23:06.220" style="s2">progressivism right which is the deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.270" end="01:23:08.260" style="s2">deep deep irony of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.220" end="01:23:11.800" style="s2">because the overall and or the hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.260" end="01:23:16.210" style="s2">really the overall intent of diversity</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.800" end="01:23:19.240" style="s2">right is to they say to surface the best</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.210" end="01:23:21.160" style="s2">right to serve for perspectives right</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.240" end="01:23:24.220" style="s2">get different ideas to like I have a</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.160" end="01:23:26.470" style="s2">competition of ideas but but actually no</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.220" end="01:23:27.910" style="s2">the one stated goal isn&#39;t is the one</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.470" end="01:23:30.340" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re actually throwing out</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.910" end="01:23:33.040" style="s2">immediately so right I mean I think it</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.340" end="01:23:34.810" style="s2">seems pretty clear that that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.040" end="01:23:36.310" style="s2">they mean right I mean it&#39;s just for</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.810" end="01:23:38.070" style="s2">what is it though what is it is its</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.310" end="01:23:41.410" style="s2">power it&#39;s right it&#39;s about power I</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.070" end="01:23:43.510" style="s2">think most things are about status and</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.410" end="01:23:45.510" style="s2">power so I don&#39;t even mean that as a bad</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.510" end="01:23:49.780" style="s2">thing right you know what I mean like I</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.510" end="01:23:52.030" style="s2">my own motives I&#39;m sure are to gain</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.780" end="01:23:56.200" style="s2">prestige and status I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.030" end="01:23:59.650" style="s2">we do but we can judge the the is it</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.200" end="01:24:02.520" style="s2">good or bad right so like for example I</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.650" end="01:24:04.660" style="s2">want to write a good science paper</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.520" end="01:24:06.370" style="s2">approximately like in my head I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.660" end="01:24:08.080" style="s2">just loved the truth and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.370" end="01:24:10.360" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s true but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.080" end="01:24:12.730" style="s2">because I also want status I want people</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.360" end="01:24:14.590" style="s2">to like me of course right and I want</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.730" end="01:24:16.540" style="s2">people to read my article and think this</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.590" end="01:24:19.450" style="s2">person is really smart look at this good</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.540" end="01:24:22.030" style="s2">idea you know but there at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.450" end="01:24:24.220" style="s2">leading to a good outcome so when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.030" end="01:24:26.530" style="s2">about power and the way you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.220" end="01:24:30.040" style="s2">and what I think is destructive about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.530" end="01:24:32.080" style="s2">is your your I think these people a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.040" end="01:24:34.630" style="s2">of them really do believe they care</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.080" end="01:24:36.730" style="s2">about minorities and that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.630" end="01:24:39.100" style="s2">trying to do but a lot of their</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.730" end="01:24:40.980" style="s2">behaviors undermine their cause because</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.100" end="01:24:45.050" style="s2">they alienate people</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.980" end="01:24:48.630" style="s2">and also I&#39;ve thought about this like</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.050" end="01:24:52.440" style="s2">when this push for diversity at all</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.630" end="01:24:54.270" style="s2">costs starts to cost them they&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.440" end="01:24:57.060" style="s2">pushing for it you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.270" end="01:24:59.310" style="s2">when their kids are losing out positions</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.060" end="01:25:01.890" style="s2">because somebody else got it who is less</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.310" end="01:25:04.980" style="s2">qualified they&#39;re gonna start to care</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.890" end="01:25:07.170" style="s2">yeah well look at the Harvard admissions</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.980" end="01:25:10.770" style="s2">scandal and the in the like the s8 the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.170" end="01:25:13.199" style="s2">Asian like yes right that that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.770" end="01:25:15.210" style="s2">happening it&#39;s already happening and of</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.199" end="01:25:16.590" style="s2">course there was like a selective school</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.210" end="01:25:19.469" style="s2">in New York I can&#39;t remember the name of</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.590" end="01:25:21.750" style="s2">it now too but just didn&#39;t have as many</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.469" end="01:25:23.250" style="s2">of the right minorities I hate going</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.750" end="01:25:24.929" style="s2">right right right you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.250" end="01:25:26.940" style="s2">somehow that somehow the Asian</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.929" end="01:25:29.460" style="s2">minorities aren&#39;t included in them they</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.940" end="01:25:31.860" style="s2">don&#39;t copy no minorities right right</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.460" end="01:25:33.840" style="s2">because they&#39;re there in this also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.860" end="01:25:36.480" style="s2">interesting right because the Asians of</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.840" end="01:25:39.239" style="s2">the the North East Asians always cause</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.480" end="01:25:41.010" style="s2">problem to the white supremacy argument</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.239" end="01:25:43.350" style="s2">because totally these people want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.010" end="01:25:45.690" style="s2">make the argument the u.s. is a white</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.350" end="01:25:48.030" style="s2">supremacist Society but then when you</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.690" end="01:25:50.880" style="s2">look at who has the highest median</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.030" end="01:25:53.219" style="s2">income is Indians and North East Asians</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.880" end="01:25:56.070" style="s2">right no and it&#39;s like well how did that</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.219" end="01:25:58.679" style="s2">work we&#39;re doing a bad job of making a</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.070" end="01:26:02.340" style="s2">white supremacist Society right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.679" end="01:26:03.750" style="s2">well this is triggering a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.340" end="01:26:05.730" style="s2">thoughts in my head I&#39;m gonna change</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.750" end="01:26:08.100" style="s2">topics here but it&#39;s probably within the</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.730" end="01:26:09.960" style="s2">same thing and also moves the agenda</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.100" end="01:26:11.489" style="s2">down to one of the other items that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.960" end="01:26:15.750" style="s2">said we could talk for about two doors</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.489" end="01:26:18.360" style="s2">on in my in my this is gonna be a tough</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.750" end="01:26:20.850" style="s2">one okay in my experience as an educator</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.360" end="01:26:23.580" style="s2">and I have looked at standardized test</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.850" end="01:26:25.860" style="s2">scores from cities schools nations all</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.580" end="01:26:27.750" style="s2">over the place mm-hmm and track them</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.860" end="01:26:31.860" style="s2">over time and looked at them there is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.750" end="01:26:34.170" style="s2">very clear separation between the</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.860" end="01:26:36.960" style="s2">performance of the Asians</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.170" end="01:26:38.130" style="s2">whites african-americans and Latinos</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.960" end="01:26:42.300" style="s2">actually goes in the other direction</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.130" end="01:26:46.199" style="s2">Asian white Latino African American</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.300" end="01:26:48.330" style="s2">correct and and and the even as the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.199" end="01:26:50.760" style="s2">there was a closing of the achievement</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.330" end="01:26:51.900" style="s2">gap as they call it but then it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.760" end="01:26:54.360" style="s2">stopped</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.900" end="01:26:58.260" style="s2">and then when you look at the scores</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.360" end="01:27:00.330" style="s2">from every different state rural versus</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.260" end="01:27:02.850" style="s2">urban whichever whichever you want to</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.330" end="01:27:06.840" style="s2">slice it the sort of separations are all</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.850" end="01:27:08.310" style="s2">very similar even even in a way that you</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.840" end="01:27:11.400" style="s2">would think would account for cultural</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.310" end="01:27:12.900" style="s2">influences and such - yeah and so to me</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.400" end="01:27:14.699" style="s2">I was looking at that and wondering like</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.900" end="01:27:17.250" style="s2">how to how to deal with that as an</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.699" end="01:27:19.020" style="s2">educator and how to deal with this</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.250" end="01:27:22.170" style="s2">notion of closing the achievement gap if</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.020" end="01:27:25.080" style="s2">it is even possibly closeable correct</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.170" end="01:27:26.640" style="s2">and so it just I&#39;m looking at my notes</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.080" end="01:27:28.949" style="s2">here I&#39;ve got Collette I&#39;ve gotten the</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.640" end="01:27:31.080" style="s2">seem to love I&#39;ve got hierarchies and IQ</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.949" end="01:27:33.420" style="s2">I got all this stuff so I was just</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.080" end="01:27:36.030" style="s2">thinking about it all together</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.420" end="01:27:38.010" style="s2">what is would in your research or in</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.030" end="01:27:40.380" style="s2">your writings or discussions you know do</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.010" end="01:27:43.650" style="s2">you have what are your thoughts on on</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.380" end="01:27:47.310" style="s2">that subject particular and yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.650" end="01:27:50.960" style="s2">am a open hereditary and and what that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.310" end="01:27:54.290" style="s2">means is I think that there are at least</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.960" end="01:27:57.210" style="s2">partially partially genetically caused</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.290" end="01:28:00.719" style="s2">cognitive ability differences between</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.210" end="01:28:02.790" style="s2">racial groups and it&#39;s pretty clear you</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.719" end="01:28:05.760" style="s2">find a pretty clear pattern such that</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.790" end="01:28:08.460" style="s2">Asians are on the top followed by</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.760" end="01:28:10.590" style="s2">Caucasians followed by Hispanics but</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.460" end="01:28:13.050" style="s2">Hispanics sort of interesting mixture</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.590" end="01:28:16.739" style="s2">right but following by african-americans</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.050" end="01:28:19.320" style="s2">and you get African American IQ</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.739" end="01:28:22.530" style="s2">somewhere around 85 Caucasian about a</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.320" end="01:28:24.090" style="s2">hundred East Asian depending on what you</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.530" end="01:28:25.350" style="s2">look at somewhere between a hundred and</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.090" end="01:28:27.679" style="s2">three and hundred and five but</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.350" end="01:28:30.030" style="s2">interesting as well Ashkenazi Jew</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.679" end="01:28:32.010" style="s2">somewhere between a hundred and eight</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.030" end="01:28:34.530" style="s2">and a hundred and fifteen maybe and</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.010" end="01:28:39.780" style="s2">these patterns are pretty consistent</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.530" end="01:28:44.969" style="s2">they&#39;re global and MICEX planation for</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.780" end="01:28:48.090" style="s2">them is some some mixture of genetics</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.969" end="01:28:50.630" style="s2">and environment but I tend to lean</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.090" end="01:28:53.460" style="s2">toward more genetic which means</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.630" end="01:28:57.179" style="s2">achievement gaps probably will never</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.460" end="01:28:59.580" style="s2">close now I&#39;m open to evidence otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.179" end="01:29:01.650" style="s2">I take this seriously of course I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.580" end="01:29:01.910" style="s2">just like spouting off I&#39;ve read the</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.650" end="01:29:04.160" style="s2">litter</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.910" end="01:29:07.610" style="s2">very carefully I&#39;ve thought about it for</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.160" end="01:29:11.540" style="s2">a long time and I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.610" end="01:29:13.880" style="s2">not it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.540" end="01:29:14.570" style="s2">perpetuate like some kind of noble lie</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.880" end="01:29:16.700" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.570" end="01:29:18.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried I mean it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.700" end="01:29:21.890" style="s2">because Arthur Jensen who&#39;s one of my</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.950" end="01:29:27.230" style="s2">intellectual heroes wrote his Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.890" end="01:29:29.270" style="s2">Education Review article on what was</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.230" end="01:29:31.870" style="s2">what&#39;s the name of it let me check the</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.270" end="01:29:31.870" style="s2">name of it</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.230" end="01:29:37.070" style="s2">IQ and scholastic achievement right</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.000" end="01:29:39.380" style="s2">there you go okay and that was about and</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.070" end="01:29:42.830" style="s2">it was looking at like compensatory</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.380" end="01:29:44.750" style="s2">education and this is 69 and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.830" end="01:29:48.620" style="s2">writing compensatory education zuv</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.750" end="01:29:52.280" style="s2">failure that&#39;s in 1969 it&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.620" end="01:29:55.520" style="s2">clearly a failure in 2019 and these</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.280" end="01:29:58.520" style="s2">group differences still show up and at</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.520" end="01:30:00.770" style="s2">least on G loaded tasks the differences</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.520" end="01:30:02.720" style="s2">are the same as they&#39;ve ever been as far</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.770" end="01:30:07.220" style="s2">as we can tell maybe you had some</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.720" end="01:30:09.320" style="s2">closure in the like 1922 1960s but I</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.220" end="01:30:11.410" style="s2">think on G voted items it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.320" end="01:30:13.670" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t been a lot of closure</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.410" end="01:30:16.340" style="s2">achievement gap you&#39;ve got a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.670" end="01:30:18.470" style="s2">more and then it slowed down and appears</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.340" end="01:30:20.840" style="s2">to be pretty large still and I doubt</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.470" end="01:30:22.730" style="s2">that it&#39;s gonna shrink much more and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.840" end="01:30:24.260" style="s2">reason I think this is important for</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.730" end="01:30:27.020" style="s2">people to understand and talk about</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.260" end="01:30:29.630" style="s2">honestly is because when we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.020" end="01:30:32.510" style="s2">grapple with this honestly we end up</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.630" end="01:30:35.720" style="s2">wasting lots of money on programs that</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.510" end="01:30:40.430" style="s2">don&#39;t do anything and also we perpetuate</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.720" end="01:30:43.400" style="s2">what I think is a very dangerous myth</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.430" end="01:30:46.250" style="s2">that our society is horrific ly racist</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.400" end="01:30:48.970" style="s2">right because think about it this way if</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.250" end="01:30:53.060" style="s2">every right if racial groups are</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.970" end="01:30:56.300" style="s2">actually equal then our society is</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.060" end="01:30:59.390" style="s2">terrible it&#39;s an immoral Society right</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.300" end="01:31:01.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a heinous Society but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.390" end="01:31:04.700" style="s2">the evidence supports that and so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.910" end="01:31:08.390" style="s2">that that&#39;s my my and I think also I</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.700" end="01:31:11.650" style="s2">mean III know you had Talab on their IQ</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.390" end="01:31:14.929" style="s2">look like IQ is one of the best</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.650" end="01:31:17.739" style="s2">psychological constructs we&#39;ve ever come</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.929" end="01:31:20.360" style="s2">with its that good now does it predict</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.739" end="01:31:24.080" style="s2">socioeconomic status with a point eight</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.360" end="01:31:27.020" style="s2">no but nothing does it does predict a</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.080" end="01:31:30.199" style="s2">lot of things in life pretty well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.020" end="01:31:32.210" style="s2">it&#39;s them if you wanted to if I had to</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.199" end="01:31:35.840" style="s2">figure out something about a person</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.210" end="01:31:37.550" style="s2">I mean maybe like race or sex or</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.840" end="01:31:39.890" style="s2">something would tell me a lot but if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.550" end="01:31:41.929" style="s2">if I would ask for IQ I would say just</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.890" end="01:31:44.690" style="s2">tell me the person&#39;s IQ and I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.929" end="01:31:46.520" style="s2">you a lot about the person now having</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.690" end="01:31:50.090" style="s2">said that I think that we shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.520" end="01:31:52.400" style="s2">a society that is functional for people</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.090" end="01:31:56.600" style="s2">who have 80 IQs and for people who have</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.400" end="01:31:59.690" style="s2">140 right I don&#39;t think I think that we</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.600" end="01:32:02.659" style="s2">need a Y pardon but why why should we do</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.690" end="01:32:06.949" style="s2">that yeah because I say is that eugenic</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.659" end="01:32:09.500" style="s2">or a dis genic I don&#39;t actually care too</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.949" end="01:32:11.090" style="s2">much one way or the other because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.500" end="01:32:13.580" style="s2">interesting because I don&#39;t I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.090" end="01:32:16.460" style="s2">care about eugenic or dis genic what I</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.580" end="01:32:18.170" style="s2">care about is people people today in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.460" end="01:32:20.300" style="s2">next generation that&#39;s what I can be</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.170" end="01:32:21.890" style="s2">certain of and I want people even if</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.300" end="01:32:24.320" style="s2">they have 80 IQs I want them to have a</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.890" end="01:32:26.179" style="s2">good life you know what I mean like I</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.320" end="01:32:28.909" style="s2">care about that and I care about people</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.179" end="01:32:30.530" style="s2">and so I think that we right well I</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.909" end="01:32:35.540" style="s2">think I was trying to think more sore</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.530" end="01:32:38.270" style="s2">like theoretically okay like like is is</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.540" end="01:32:41.120" style="s2">our society benefited by having people</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.270" end="01:32:43.670" style="s2">with AD IQ in it are are collected I</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.120" end="01:32:45.020" style="s2">think we should I think we have to well</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.670" end="01:32:46.370" style="s2">okay so I guess I would say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.020" end="01:32:48.949" style="s2">good question I would say a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.370" end="01:32:53.150" style="s2">things about I would say this is where I</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.949" end="01:32:54.980" style="s2">I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re an atheist I am the</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.150" end="01:32:57.130" style="s2">least skeptical of religion that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.980" end="01:33:00.560" style="s2">ever been in my life today but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.130" end="01:33:02.360" style="s2">non-religious okay so I&#39;m an atheist but</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.560" end="01:33:04.400" style="s2">I think that the Crick I was just</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.360" end="01:33:05.719" style="s2">actually thinking about this yesterday I</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.400" end="01:33:08.390" style="s2">was talking to somebody about it I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.719" end="01:33:11.510" style="s2">the Christian emphasis on the sanctity</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.390" end="01:33:14.030" style="s2">of life even though it leads to some</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.510" end="01:33:15.920" style="s2">policies that I don&#39;t like I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.030" end="01:33:19.850" style="s2">actually really important and I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.920" end="01:33:22.760" style="s2">look like I guess I don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.850" end="01:33:25.010" style="s2">too much into does society benefit or</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.760" end="01:33:25.979" style="s2">not from having people with AD IQ we</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.010" end="01:33:28.289" style="s2">have people</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.979" end="01:33:30.300" style="s2">atiq and what I want to do is make the</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.289" end="01:33:32.610" style="s2">world a good place for them if we can</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.300" end="01:33:34.920" style="s2">and I think we need to harness their</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.610" end="01:33:37.349" style="s2">talents whatever they are they are and</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.920" end="01:33:39.389" style="s2">they have talents they have meaning they</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.349" end="01:33:42.389" style="s2">have dignity they have subjective</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.389" end="01:33:45.030" style="s2">experience I think I want it I want my</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.389" end="01:33:47.280" style="s2">dog to have a good life you know like my</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.030" end="01:33:49.289" style="s2">criterion is do you have subjective</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.280" end="01:33:52.229" style="s2">experience and if you do then I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.289" end="01:33:53.969" style="s2">you you&#39;re a living organism that I care</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.229" end="01:33:58.139" style="s2">about and that I want you to have a</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.969" end="01:33:59.940" style="s2">dignified life so I okay and so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.139" end="01:34:02.280" style="s2">not suggesting you don&#39;t I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.940" end="01:34:04.679" style="s2">fair question but that&#39;s my answer to it</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.280" end="01:34:06.800" style="s2">and now but having said that dole it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.679" end="01:34:10.110" style="s2">like set that aside and note like this</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.800" end="01:34:12.420" style="s2">sort of Talib argument or Talib Harper</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.110" end="01:34:14.249" style="s2">you say it&#39;s name that IQ is</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.420" end="01:34:18.150" style="s2">that&#39;s just ridiculous it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.249" end="01:34:20.159" style="s2">completely ridiculous IQs important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.150" end="01:34:22.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it tells us something about a</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.159" end="01:34:28.440" style="s2">person&#39;s ability to succeed especially</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.920" end="01:34:33.119" style="s2">on in education and and high cognitively</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.440" end="01:34:35.610" style="s2">demanding jobs and so we I think we have</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.119" end="01:34:38.190" style="s2">to accept group differences and deal</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.610" end="01:34:41.760" style="s2">with them more maturely than we have for</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.190" end="01:34:43.800" style="s2">the past 50 60 years right I think what</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.760" end="01:34:46.739" style="s2">we&#39;ve done has been an incredible</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.800" end="01:34:48.479" style="s2">embarrassment it maybe has made white</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.739" end="01:34:50.880" style="s2">liberals feel better about themselves</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.479" end="01:34:55.559" style="s2">but it actually hasn&#39;t improved anything</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.880" end="01:34:59.670" style="s2">in society right right so that I mean to</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.559" end="01:35:01.349" style="s2">me that&#39;s the the real rub is like what</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.670" end="01:35:03.780" style="s2">do we do with the data the information</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.349" end="01:35:07.349" style="s2">when finally one day somebody is like</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.780" end="01:35:10.110" style="s2">okay it&#39;s proven there are IQ</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.349" end="01:35:13.679" style="s2">differences by race and all these things</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.110" end="01:35:16.979" style="s2">what do we do then and how do we use</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.679" end="01:35:19.530" style="s2">this information to help people well I</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.979" end="01:35:21.389" style="s2">mean and and then you know again and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.530" end="01:35:25.349" style="s2">keep coming back to this like where is</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.389" end="01:35:28.260" style="s2">my loyalty is my loyalty to like me and</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.349" end="01:35:30.239" style="s2">my specific set of genes or like the</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.260" end="01:35:33.510" style="s2">gene pool at large</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.239" end="01:35:35.039" style="s2">Oh what is the most important thing and</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.510" end="01:35:36.250" style="s2">I&#39;m throwing a bunch of things yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.039" end="01:35:38.380" style="s2">think this most</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.250" end="01:35:40.350" style="s2">were to me the most important thing the</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.380" end="01:35:44.230" style="s2">thing that I take the most meaning in is</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.350" end="01:35:45.940" style="s2">sort of like culture English altar and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.230" end="01:35:48.820" style="s2">want to be clear again about Anglo</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.940" end="01:35:51.220" style="s2">culture I don&#39;t mean Denzel Washington&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.820" end="01:35:54.030" style="s2">a member of Anglo culture right it</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.220" end="01:35:56.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you have to be pasty white</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.030" end="01:35:59.650" style="s2">right but I mean that&#39;s what means</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.950" end="01:36:02.260" style="s2">something to me and I want to preserve</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.650" end="01:36:04.360" style="s2">that and I want to make sure that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.260" end="01:36:07.390" style="s2">it&#39;s been a very successful culture and</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.360" end="01:36:10.180" style="s2">that that&#39;s important to me do you think</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.390" end="01:36:13.450" style="s2">that that same culture is best and would</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.180" end="01:36:15.820" style="s2">be as important to all peoples of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.450" end="01:36:18.280" style="s2">world even the ones that evolved in</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.820" end="01:36:19.990" style="s2">their isolated no comments exactly so I</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.280" end="01:36:22.810" style="s2">don&#39;t think like I don&#39;t want the hot I</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.990" end="01:36:26.650" style="s2">don&#39;t think the hodza in in Africa need</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.810" end="01:36:28.960" style="s2">to be members of Anglo societies right I</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.650" end="01:36:32.940" style="s2">think that are doing fine on with their</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.960" end="01:36:36.610" style="s2">own culture and that&#39;s okay yeah I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.940" end="01:36:40.240" style="s2">Collins yeah okay okay cultural</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.610" end="01:36:41.980" style="s2">pluralist but yet Western Anglo is the</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.240" end="01:36:43.930" style="s2">one that you want to possess the one</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.980" end="01:36:45.850" style="s2">that I like and that I care about yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.930" end="01:36:47.830" style="s2">so like yeah that&#39;s a good way to</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.850" end="01:36:49.840" style="s2">explain it is to think about I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.830" end="01:36:52.930" style="s2">is not a perfect analogy but think of</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.840" end="01:36:55.330" style="s2">like cuisines for example so like I like</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.930" end="01:36:57.370" style="s2">a lot of different cuisines but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.330" end="01:36:58.900" style="s2">I&#39;m more attached to one kind of cuisine</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.370" end="01:37:02.350" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean I want other</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.900" end="01:37:03.850" style="s2">cuisines to disappear I suppose but if</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.350" end="01:37:06.610" style="s2">those are other cuisines I made you sick</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.850" end="01:37:08.200" style="s2">and killed you yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.610" end="01:37:10.810" style="s2">different so if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.200" end="01:37:13.390" style="s2">culture is like I have no problem</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.810" end="01:37:15.220" style="s2">attempting to obliterate than the Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.390" end="01:37:19.780" style="s2">regime right that&#39;s a culture that I</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.220" end="01:37:21.910" style="s2">don&#39;t want to thrive or a Soviet</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.780" end="01:37:24.340" style="s2">Communism that&#39;s a culture I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.910" end="01:37:27.310" style="s2">to thrive well I I think it&#39;s what about</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.340" end="01:37:29.200" style="s2">what about contemporary China you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.310" end="01:37:31.690" style="s2">what like that the honest truth is I</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.200" end="01:37:34.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about it to comment</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.690" end="01:37:37.410" style="s2">terribly intelligently I&#39;ve attempted to</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.300" end="01:37:40.450" style="s2">like go over Chinese history and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.410" end="01:37:42.220" style="s2">basically and on the weekend</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.450" end="01:37:43.840" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s because I think like I</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.220" end="01:37:45.820" style="s2">think to myself I&#39;m like you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.840" end="01:37:47.230" style="s2">really important China&#39;s becoming a</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.820" end="01:37:49.690" style="s2">major player right</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.230" end="01:37:51.490" style="s2">and so I want to understand right like</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.690" end="01:37:53.890" style="s2">the history of China and their culture</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.490" end="01:37:55.780" style="s2">but tell you the truth I basically end</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.890" end="01:37:58.090" style="s2">at the Mao era because it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.780" end="01:38:00.100" style="s2">interesting to me and I honestly just</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.090" end="01:38:01.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about it to comment</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.100" end="01:38:03.490" style="s2">intelligently right but you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.840" end="01:38:05.800" style="s2">just make a sweeping generalization to</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.490" end="01:38:07.540" style="s2">say that they&#39;re open to more of</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.800" end="01:38:09.880" style="s2">collective thinking in action than we</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.540" end="01:38:11.980" style="s2">are and inclined to use totalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.880" end="01:38:15.570" style="s2">tactics to get there and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.980" end="01:38:18.310" style="s2">time have been responsible for like</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.570" end="01:38:19.690" style="s2">eliminating the you know greatest number</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.310" end="01:38:22.180" style="s2">of people out of poverty in the last</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.690" end="01:38:24.100" style="s2">like 40 years yeah so right so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.180" end="01:38:28.810" style="s2">of a mixed bag right and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.100" end="01:38:32.710" style="s2">because I talked to Chinese exchange</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.810" end="01:38:34.750" style="s2">students who are I mean certainly their</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.710" end="01:38:36.790" style="s2">attitudes are different from mine so I</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.750" end="01:38:40.290" style="s2">remember one of the Chinese exchange</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.790" end="01:38:42.670" style="s2">students I talked to she defended</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.290" end="01:38:45.100" style="s2">Internet censorship she just thought it</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.670" end="01:38:48.070" style="s2">was perfectly reasonable to censor the</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.100" end="01:38:50.290" style="s2">internet right and you know what like if</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.070" end="01:38:52.450" style="s2">enough people are kind of okay with that</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.290" end="01:38:54.070" style="s2">that I&#39;m okay with that but I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.450" end="01:38:56.020" style="s2">clear that I just don&#39;t know enough I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.070" end="01:38:58.540" style="s2">have to know more to comment and tell</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.020" end="01:39:00.970" style="s2">you that I do think however that</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.540" end="01:39:03.430" style="s2">whatever society they create will likely</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.970" end="01:39:06.310" style="s2">be more collectivistic than a European</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.430" end="01:39:08.920" style="s2">society and that probably is fine and</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.310" end="01:39:11.650" style="s2">that&#39;s probably more tailored to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.920" end="01:39:13.840" style="s2">traits that they have right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.650" end="01:39:15.940" style="s2">that I personally care about Anglo</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.840" end="01:39:18.640" style="s2">culture so that&#39;s what I like and what</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.940" end="01:39:22.060" style="s2">I&#39;d like to preserve so about the gene</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.640" end="01:39:25.930" style="s2">pool I guess what I would say is I hope</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.060" end="01:39:29.740" style="s2">that Anglo the future of Anglo culture</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.930" end="01:39:32.080" style="s2">is consistent with a Christian ethic</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.740" end="01:39:35.680" style="s2">about the importance of all life and we</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.080" end="01:39:39.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have to talk about like gene genes</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.680" end="01:39:41.920" style="s2">in that way I&#39;m Pro embryo selection and</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.250" end="01:39:45.280" style="s2">genetic enhancement but I&#39;m not Pro any</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.920" end="01:39:47.680" style="s2">coercive you know anything discouraging</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.280" end="01:39:50.290" style="s2">people from breeding if they want to or</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.680" end="01:39:53.830" style="s2">obviously sterilization etc I would</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.290" end="01:39:55.270" style="s2">oppose that with a lot of money I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.830" end="01:39:59.230" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a very productive</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.270" end="01:39:59.530" style="s2">route to take right but I do think I</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.230" end="01:40:02.530" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.530" end="01:40:04.840" style="s2">I think immigration restriction ISM is</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.530" end="01:40:06.430" style="s2">probably an important component of</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.840" end="01:40:09.000" style="s2">preserving the culture and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.430" end="01:40:11.410" style="s2">something that makes me sympathetic to</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.000" end="01:40:15.100" style="s2">you know the Steven Millers of the world</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.410" end="01:40:17.560" style="s2">right the sort of trunk view of</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.100" end="01:40:19.360" style="s2">immigration I&#39;m pretty on board with and</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.560" end="01:40:21.430" style="s2">it also alienates me from a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.360" end="01:40:24.820" style="s2">people who would otherwise defend me who</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.430" end="01:40:27.580" style="s2">don&#39;t like that right and what what is</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.820" end="01:40:29.050" style="s2">it about what is it about restricted</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.580" end="01:40:31.090" style="s2">immigration that appeals to your sense</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.050" end="01:40:32.650" style="s2">as a evolutionary psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.090" end="01:40:34.360" style="s2">psychologist somebody who&#39;s interested</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.650" end="01:40:36.580" style="s2">in preserving Western values and ideals</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.360" end="01:40:38.830" style="s2">and Christian based you know faith in</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.580" end="01:40:40.600" style="s2">life and you call it you call it Anglo</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.830" end="01:40:41.980" style="s2">society I mean truly it&#39;s really like</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.600" end="01:40:44.590" style="s2">Christian society and I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.980" end="01:40:46.060" style="s2">Christian yeah absolutely live in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.590" end="01:40:48.190" style="s2">Christian society like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.060" end="01:40:51.040" style="s2">question about it so what about</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.190" end="01:40:53.470" style="s2">restrictive immigration appeals to that</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.040" end="01:40:55.810" style="s2">sense well I think I think that there</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.470" end="01:40:57.820" style="s2">are a couple of things so first is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.810" end="01:40:59.590" style="s2">people are different all right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.820" end="01:41:00.970" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly the case that people are</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.590" end="01:41:03.400" style="s2">different now again that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.970" end="01:41:07.150" style="s2">that people can&#39;t participate in English</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.400" end="01:41:09.310" style="s2">or who aren&#39;t anglo-saxon right they can</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.150" end="01:41:11.350" style="s2">and I&#39;m a hundred percent for that and</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.310" end="01:41:13.870" style="s2">the people who are here we have to treat</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.350" end="01:41:15.880" style="s2">with a hundred percent citizenship equal</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.870" end="01:41:18.040" style="s2">rights and never even threaten like</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.880" end="01:41:20.860" style="s2">deporting or getting rid of anybody but</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.040" end="01:41:23.110" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean we need to let more</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.860" end="01:41:24.910" style="s2">people in who might not share the</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.110" end="01:41:27.490" style="s2">cultural values that we have or might</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.910" end="01:41:29.830" style="s2">have slight personality differences that</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.490" end="01:41:32.610" style="s2">don&#39;t promote that culture I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.830" end="01:41:34.620" style="s2">think there&#39;s anything wrong with I mean</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.610" end="01:41:36.970" style="s2">immigration law I don&#39;t know I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.620" end="01:41:39.400" style="s2">want to challenge you on that right okay</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.970" end="01:41:41.560" style="s2">all right i I I think you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.400" end="01:41:43.600" style="s2">qualitative quality have no subjective</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.560" end="01:41:45.970" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re determining good or bad</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.600" end="01:41:48.040" style="s2">oh of culture you&#39;re saying this is good</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.970" end="01:41:51.490" style="s2">and this is bad in some degree and</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.040" end="01:41:54.490" style="s2">you&#39;re attributing the culture to</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.490" end="01:41:57.400" style="s2">people&#39;s innate characteristics and then</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.490" end="01:42:00.730" style="s2">saying I like to preserve my culture</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.400" end="01:42:02.890" style="s2">good and I don&#39;t want it to be changed</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.730" end="01:42:04.930" style="s2">with the bad so we&#39;re gonna keep those</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.890" end="01:42:07.480" style="s2">people out is that I mean it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.930" end="01:42:08.450" style="s2">pithy way of saying complex and nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.480" end="01:42:11.530" style="s2">argument but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.450" end="01:42:15.830" style="s2">pity way that makes it sound bad right</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.530" end="01:42:17.390" style="s2">well right well ya know it makes it and</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.830" end="01:42:19.070" style="s2">this is this is sort of why I brought it</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.390" end="01:42:23.990" style="s2">up and I&#39;m struggling with this as well</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.070" end="01:42:25.610" style="s2">- it&#39;s like why is it bad well I have</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.990" end="01:42:28.700" style="s2">perceived as been it&#39;s perceived as</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.610" end="01:42:31.280" style="s2">being bad for sure right so what I I</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.700" end="01:42:33.710" style="s2">mean why is it bad I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.280" end="01:42:36.110" style="s2">actually honestly I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.710" end="01:42:38.780" style="s2">necessarily bad it&#39;s certainly perceived</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.110" end="01:42:41.930" style="s2">as bad and I guess what I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.780" end="01:42:45.530" style="s2">you know I&#39;m sympathetic to worries</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.930" end="01:42:47.510" style="s2">about like casual talk about these</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.530" end="01:42:50.210" style="s2">things I understand like look they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.510" end="01:42:52.760" style="s2">there people have done horrible things</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.210" end="01:42:54.260" style="s2">in the name of tribe and race and I</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.760" end="01:42:56.060" style="s2">understand that and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.260" end="01:42:58.940" style="s2">perfectly reasonable to be cautious</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.060" end="01:43:02.180" style="s2">about that on the other hand however the</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.940" end="01:43:04.880" style="s2">Japanese like Japan isn&#39;t clamoring for</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.180" end="01:43:08.230" style="s2">more non Japanese immigrants right they</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.880" end="01:43:10.640" style="s2">have a sort of understanding about</p>

<p begin="01:43:14.810" end="01:43:21.260" style="s2">reasonable to have this conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.120" end="01:43:23.600" style="s2">to and to say like look like we want</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.260" end="01:43:26.950" style="s2">people who share who have a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.600" end="01:43:30.710" style="s2">affinity for the culture here right and</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.950" end="01:43:32.750" style="s2">likely as a me wax said that means more</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.710" end="01:43:34.730" style="s2">European people and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.750" end="01:43:37.400" style="s2">perfectly reasonable I I don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="01:44:01.520" end="01:44:07.130" style="s2">we have the kind of culture and we would</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.160" end="01:44:09.860" style="s2">like to add to that culture and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.130" end="01:44:12.290" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do yeah and and you</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.860" end="01:44:14.330" style="s2">can handle it good yeah so I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.290" end="01:44:16.960" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.330" end="01:44:16.960" style="s2">unfortunate</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.050" end="01:44:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s just unfortunate is the consequence</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.820" end="01:44:23.990" style="s2">of the of this power struggle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.250" end="01:44:25.400" style="s2">what it is it&#39;s the power struggle so</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.990" end="01:44:28.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve all been selected with these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.400" end="01:44:30.710" style="s2">this yeah wanting to preserve your thing</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.040" end="01:44:32.330" style="s2">that you like is bad so Lynette and</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.710" end="01:44:34.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve been infected with that idea as a</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.330" end="01:44:36.770" style="s2">way to degrade our abilities to defend</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.700" end="01:44:39.710" style="s2">those ideas I think you know we&#39;re yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.770" end="01:44:41.060" style="s2">so I I think I would but let&#39;s I think I</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.710" end="01:44:43.400" style="s2">would agree with most of that but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.060" end="01:44:46.190" style="s2">try to be like as charitable as we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.400" end="01:44:47.570" style="s2">so like I guess the charitable you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.190" end="01:44:51.710" style="s2">what I mean those like the charitable</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.570" end="01:44:54.710" style="s2">take would be look like people did some</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.710" end="01:44:57.980" style="s2">nasty things the Nazis really were nasty</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.710" end="01:45:00.230" style="s2">and they did take racial ideas and use</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.980" end="01:45:03.230" style="s2">them in an incredibly destructive way</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.230" end="01:45:06.020" style="s2">and I understand concerns about that in</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.230" end="01:45:08.810" style="s2">fact the history of Nazi Germany is one</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.020" end="01:45:11.450" style="s2">of my interest precisely so I can</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.810" end="01:45:14.270" style="s2">understand how that goes wrong and and</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.450" end="01:45:17.900" style="s2">like we need to understand that and and</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.270" end="01:45:20.540" style="s2">so that&#39;s important to me but I would</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.900" end="01:45:22.670" style="s2">urge these people to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.540" end="01:45:24.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge distinction between what</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.670" end="01:45:29.330" style="s2">we&#39;re saying and what Nazis were saying</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.800" end="01:45:31.430" style="s2">right right and incorrect yes correct</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.330" end="01:45:33.380" style="s2">and so yeah so but the charitable</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.430" end="01:45:36.020" style="s2">reading is look some of these people</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.380" end="01:45:38.480" style="s2">actually do have legitimate concerns and</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.020" end="01:45:40.310" style="s2">I think that&#39;s perfectly fine let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.480" end="01:45:42.230" style="s2">a conversation about it though don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.310" end="01:45:45.770" style="s2">shut it down by calling somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.230" end="01:45:48.080" style="s2">wants to restrict immigration to 500,000</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.770" end="01:45:49.910" style="s2">and who think that we should be allowing</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.080" end="01:45:52.910" style="s2">in immigrants who are highly educated</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.910" end="01:45:55.670" style="s2">and who share cultural affinity with our</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.910" end="01:46:00.560" style="s2">culture don&#39;t call that racist cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.670" end="01:46:02.900" style="s2">not right it&#39;s pragmatic it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.560" end="01:46:07.040" style="s2">reasonable I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.900" end="01:46:09.500" style="s2">perfectly reasonable as well yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.040" end="01:46:11.750" style="s2">again you know I personally have been</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.500" end="01:46:14.150" style="s2">infected with this self doubt about</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.750" end="01:46:17.270" style="s2">those issues and it&#39;s and it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.150" end="01:46:19.940" style="s2">the propaganda war ongoing information</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.270" end="01:46:21.350" style="s2">war that to even consider these notions</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.940" end="01:46:23.480" style="s2">you&#39;re automatically a bad person</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.350" end="01:46:25.730" style="s2">automatically can&#39;t deal with you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.480" end="01:46:27.440" style="s2">alright Nazi you don&#39;t deserve to work</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.730" end="01:46:29.219" style="s2">you don&#39;t deserve to have a career in</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.440" end="01:46:30.869" style="s2">some cases you don&#39;t deserve to</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.219" end="01:46:32.610" style="s2">you have access to financial</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.869" end="01:46:36.179" style="s2">institutions or to be a little conductor</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.610" end="01:46:39.079" style="s2">I mean in sections yeah speak in the</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.179" end="01:46:43.829" style="s2">public or speak in the public square and</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.079" end="01:46:45.389" style="s2">all these things I think this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.829" end="01:46:47.159" style="s2">where the real divide is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.389" end="01:46:50.550" style="s2">politically speaking I think it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.159" end="01:46:52.650" style="s2">be people that are not blankly a blank</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.550" end="01:46:54.510" style="s2">slate at least the people that use a</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.650" end="01:46:58.229" style="s2">blank slate to their own ends on one</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.510" end="01:46:59.969" style="s2">side right and then people who are have</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.229" end="01:47:02.340" style="s2">a commitment to just the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.969" end="01:47:06.510" style="s2">reality and leading and going where the</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.340" end="01:47:08.760" style="s2">data leads you and Steven Pinker once</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.510" end="01:47:11.610" style="s2">wrote about his version of feminism</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.760" end="01:47:15.150" style="s2">which is it believes in an equality of</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.610" end="01:47:16.949" style="s2">opportunity for everybody but also is</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.150" end="01:47:18.960" style="s2">open to going to where the the data</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.949" end="01:47:20.699" style="s2">takes you you know and right and I think</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.960" end="01:47:23.150" style="s2">that that&#39;s this is this is the new</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.699" end="01:47:25.619" style="s2">political divide which hasn&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.150" end="01:47:29.010" style="s2">shaken itself out just yet because</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.619" end="01:47:31.679" style="s2">people Democrats who aren&#39;t fully aware</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.010" end="01:47:33.570" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening in academia in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.679" end="01:47:35.820" style="s2">media all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.570" end="01:47:38.639" style="s2">haven&#39;t haven&#39;t processed or even just</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.820" end="01:47:41.280" style="s2">begin to grapple with the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.639" end="01:47:43.260" style="s2">bedrock notions that the radical wing of</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.280" end="01:47:44.699" style="s2">the Democratic Party is based on which</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.260" end="01:47:48.389" style="s2">is also now dragging the whole party</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.699" end="01:47:49.679" style="s2">whole party to the left and the one last</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.389" end="01:47:52.219" style="s2">thing I wanted to talk about here in</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.679" end="01:47:55.199" style="s2">this it was about hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.219" end="01:47:58.139" style="s2">because the the divide is like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.199" end="01:47:59.760" style="s2">no hierarchies right the the on the left</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.139" end="01:48:01.559" style="s2">no hierarchies on the right as</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.760" end="01:48:03.840" style="s2">hierarchies right like we believe</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.559" end="01:48:05.159" style="s2">there&#39;s I think Jordan Peterson used to</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.840" end="01:48:08.070" style="s2">talk about dominance hierarchies which I</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.159" end="01:48:11.190" style="s2">thought was bold but then he changed it</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.070" end="01:48:13.019" style="s2">so like competence hierarchies I said I</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.190" end="01:48:15.900" style="s2">think he he sort of got a little soft on</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.019" end="01:48:20.539" style="s2">that actually but well you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.900" end="01:48:23.280" style="s2">would defend competence hierarchy yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.539" end="01:48:26.099" style="s2">versus versus dominance heart yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.280" end="01:48:27.960" style="s2">because I think well it depends or are</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.099" end="01:48:31.650" style="s2">we saying that these things are good or</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.960" end="01:48:35.010" style="s2">something well I think that their</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.650" end="01:48:37.440" style="s2">natural natural yeah yeah and and we all</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.010" end="01:48:39.329" style="s2">operate within within a hierarchy sure</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.440" end="01:48:40.889" style="s2">and that yes hierarchies hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.329" end="01:48:42.300" style="s2">hierarchies are not only good but</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.889" end="01:48:44.520" style="s2">essential because</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.300" end="01:48:46.170" style="s2">is out of hierarchy how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.520" end="01:48:48.450" style="s2">know what&#39;s best and if we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.170" end="01:48:51.420" style="s2">what&#39;s best out of we evolve yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.450" end="01:48:53.880" style="s2">like a hierarchy hierarchy I don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.420" end="01:48:56.820" style="s2">not a geneticist but like to me a</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.880" end="01:48:59.490" style="s2">hierarchy is a precondition for natural</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.820" end="01:49:02.310" style="s2">selection I don&#39;t know like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.490" end="01:49:04.140" style="s2">exactly sure what that maybe I&#39;ll set</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.310" end="01:49:06.480" style="s2">that one out because I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.140" end="01:49:07.890" style="s2">that means exactly but I do I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.480" end="01:49:09.360" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve said and you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.890" end="01:49:12.270" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I&#39;ve thought about this</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.360" end="01:49:14.280" style="s2">a lot and this is related so like I</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.270" end="01:49:17.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this is good or bad but</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.280" end="01:49:19.290" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of like a I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.640" end="01:49:21.180" style="s2">put it this I don&#39;t know exact the best</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.290" end="01:49:24.180" style="s2">way to put it but like sort of hatred of</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.180" end="01:49:27.480" style="s2">excellence or something so like the the</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.180" end="01:49:29.760" style="s2">fact that like very very beautiful women</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.480" end="01:49:31.680" style="s2">like a lot of people have a problem if</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.760" end="01:49:34.250" style="s2">you advertise with a very very beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.680" end="01:49:36.180" style="s2">woman because that&#39;s kind of like not</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.250" end="01:49:37.710" style="s2">egalitarian and there are people who</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.180" end="01:49:41.340" style="s2">aren&#39;t beautiful who are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.710" end="01:49:42.810" style="s2">excluded from that and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.340" end="01:49:44.310" style="s2">the best way of dealing with that is</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.810" end="01:49:46.290" style="s2">because the fact of the matter is I</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.310" end="01:49:48.300" style="s2">think hierarchies are important I think</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.290" end="01:49:49.860" style="s2">excellent should be celebrated and we</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.300" end="01:49:51.420" style="s2">should know what&#39;s better and we should</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.860" end="01:49:53.880" style="s2">be willing to deal with it we should be</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.420" end="01:49:56.580" style="s2">okay with that I&#39;m not as good at LeBron</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.880" end="01:50:00.570" style="s2">James at basketball I never will be and</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.580" end="01:50:03.540" style="s2">I just admire him for it right and right</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.570" end="01:50:06.900" style="s2">but how do you get somebody how do you</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.540" end="01:50:08.490" style="s2">get somebody with an 80 85 IQ who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.900" end="01:50:11.930" style="s2">oppressed in all these</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.490" end="01:50:15.240" style="s2">intersectional ways to say I admire</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.930" end="01:50:18.300" style="s2">somebody with 120 I crying oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.240" end="01:50:19.770" style="s2">just great and oh this I admire that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.300" end="01:50:21.360" style="s2">using their words here am i er that</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.770" end="01:50:24.450" style="s2">privilege like this is their perspective</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.360" end="01:50:26.370" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to yeah but you know why</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.450" end="01:50:28.380" style="s2">you get people to accept their place in</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.370" end="01:50:30.360" style="s2">the hierarchy it&#39;s not about playing</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.380" end="01:50:32.610" style="s2">basketball that&#39;s like an easy one yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.360" end="01:50:36.570" style="s2">that&#39;s true that&#39;s fair I think one</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.610" end="01:50:39.240" style="s2">thing is you have to I will say there is</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.570" end="01:50:43.140" style="s2">partially a failure of our society I</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.240" end="01:50:46.050" style="s2">think is that we need those people to</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.140" end="01:50:47.820" style="s2">have a dignified place in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.050" end="01:50:51.840" style="s2">and another thing that I will criticize</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.820" end="01:50:54.720" style="s2">elite progressives for is they ridicule</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.840" end="01:50:56.910" style="s2">the kind of jobs that actually give me</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.720" end="01:50:58.980" style="s2">mean to somebody&#39;s life like that they</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.910" end="01:51:01.500" style="s2">ridicule construction workers and</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.980" end="01:51:04.140" style="s2">Walmart workers in the factory pre-poll</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.500" end="01:51:06.390" style="s2">yes and so there&#39;s like this elitism</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.140" end="01:51:09.450" style="s2">that actually contradicts their stated</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.390" end="01:51:12.180" style="s2">goal of helping the downtrodden right at</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.450" end="01:51:14.550" style="s2">least old-school socialists really did</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.180" end="01:51:16.590" style="s2">care about the union workers right and</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.550" end="01:51:19.080" style="s2">they did care about like these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.590" end="01:51:21.510" style="s2">factory workers the new progressives are</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.080" end="01:51:23.460" style="s2">actually like basically leading is to</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.510" end="01:51:25.770" style="s2">look down their noses at them and I</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.460" end="01:51:27.900" style="s2">think that&#39;s too bad because I think we</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.770" end="01:51:29.910" style="s2">should celebrate somebody who&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.900" end="01:51:32.130" style="s2">at Walmart and in trying to take care of</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.910" end="01:51:34.110" style="s2">his or her business and we need those</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.130" end="01:51:35.970" style="s2">people and we should be thankful for</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.110" end="01:51:38.970" style="s2">them to some degree and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.970" end="01:51:42.390" style="s2">important to recognize that and to value</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.970" end="01:51:44.820" style="s2">that and I think if we did some of this</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.390" end="01:51:48.000" style="s2">feeling of the some of this oppression</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.820" end="01:51:50.340" style="s2">Olympics would dissipate at least a bit</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.000" end="01:51:52.470" style="s2">because if you feel as though you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.340" end="01:51:55.530" style="s2">valued member of the community it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.470" end="01:51:59.040" style="s2">easier to look up to people on the in</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.530" end="01:52:01.200" style="s2">the hierarchy right it&#39;s easier to look</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.040" end="01:52:02.760" style="s2">up to somebody who&#39;s above you as long</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.200" end="01:52:04.530" style="s2">as you feel as though you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.760" end="01:52:07.110" style="s2">meaningful contribution and say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.530" end="01:52:09.930" style="s2">that person&#39;s above me but I&#39;m a part of</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.110" end="01:52:12.840" style="s2">this coalition and they need me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.930" end="01:52:15.300" style="s2">a certain lack of empathy I think in</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.840" end="01:52:18.060" style="s2">built into progressivism which is which</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.300" end="01:52:20.910" style="s2">is kind of ironic and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.060" end="01:52:22.980" style="s2">people who are aware of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.910" end="01:52:24.420" style="s2">appreciate them operate within them</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.980" end="01:52:26.970" style="s2">understand their place in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.420" end="01:52:30.090" style="s2">like I&#39;m generally the biggest guy</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.970" end="01:52:32.640" style="s2">around I&#39;m six for 250 yeah naturally</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.090" end="01:52:36.120" style="s2">sort of dominant and when I&#39;m in a when</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.640" end="01:52:38.790" style="s2">I&#39;m I don&#39;t even ask for leadership and</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.120" end="01:52:40.470" style="s2">such in group settings it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.790" end="01:52:41.940" style="s2">task gets laid before the group and</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.470" end="01:52:43.890" style="s2">everyone&#39;s head just kind of turns to me</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.940" end="01:52:45.120" style="s2">right cuz right cuz I&#39;m the tallest and</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.890" end="01:52:47.820" style="s2">I&#39;m the biggest and whatever and I have</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.120" end="01:52:49.620" style="s2">a big beard but I also know when I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.820" end="01:52:52.440" style="s2">the presence of people that have more</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.620" end="01:52:54.540" style="s2">more power and like deserve it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.440" end="01:52:57.780" style="s2">like I admire and respect those people</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.540" end="01:52:59.449" style="s2">right and it&#39;s easy for me to say that</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.780" end="01:53:02.209" style="s2">because I am sort of higher up in</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.449" end="01:53:04.940" style="s2">hierarchy yourself but like there has to</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.209" end="01:53:06.619" style="s2">be an appreciation for all those around</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.940" end="01:53:08.929" style="s2">you above you and understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.619" end="01:53:11.179" style="s2">you&#39;re operating within a system yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.929" end="01:53:14.119" style="s2">mean I think this is something I think</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.179" end="01:53:17.690" style="s2">about a lot honestly and and like I</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.119" end="01:53:19.579" style="s2">think one of the reason this sounds kind</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.690" end="01:53:23.690" style="s2">of silly but one of the reasons am be</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.579" end="01:53:26.420" style="s2">apocalyptic me is because you can kind</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.690" end="01:53:28.820" style="s2">of see you get this meaningful group in</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.420" end="01:53:30.530" style="s2">which people will defer to the person</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.820" end="01:53:31.400" style="s2">who&#39;s better because their lives depend</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.530" end="01:53:34.579" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.400" end="01:53:40.489" style="s2">and that gives people meaning you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.579" end="01:53:43.459" style="s2">they don&#39;t McCann stitchy CIL&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.489" end="01:53:46.039" style="s2">that envy people would feel right and so</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.459" end="01:53:47.690" style="s2">I think to be fair we should think about</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.039" end="01:53:49.280" style="s2">what we were saying about sexual</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.690" end="01:53:51.949" style="s2">redistribution and economic</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.280" end="01:53:54.079" style="s2">redistribution it&#39;s understandable that</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.949" end="01:53:55.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re at the bottom of a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.079" end="01:53:59.389" style="s2">you would be a little bit bitter and</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.760" end="01:54:01.369" style="s2">envious I totally get that but when you</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.389" end="01:54:03.349" style="s2">feel as though you&#39;re in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.369" end="01:54:05.329" style="s2">that&#39;s accomplishing something and</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.349" end="01:54:07.219" style="s2">you&#39;re working together with the</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.329" end="01:54:09.110" style="s2">hierarchy then you can get rid of that</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.219" end="01:54:11.539" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I like nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.110" end="01:54:13.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why nationalism appeals to me</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.539" end="01:54:16.280" style="s2">because you can have this sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.880" end="01:54:18.289" style="s2">know what I&#39;m not a billionaire I</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.280" end="01:54:20.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t I didn&#39;t make the iPhone I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.289" end="01:54:23.239" style="s2">writing articles but I&#39;m an American and</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.900" end="01:54:26.059" style="s2">I&#39;m contributing to America and I love</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.239" end="01:54:28.849" style="s2">my country and that&#39;s meaningful and and</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.059" end="01:54:31.190" style="s2">this is why I the progressive attack on</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.849" end="01:54:34.130" style="s2">nationalism bothers me because you</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.190" end="01:54:36.469" style="s2">you&#39;re taking away the meaning from</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.130" end="01:54:39.079" style="s2">these people but you&#39;re making fun of</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.469" end="01:54:41.599" style="s2">them essentially you&#39;re making fun of</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.079" end="01:54:43.459" style="s2">them by making fun of the nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.599" end="01:54:47.539" style="s2">and taking pride in your country you</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.459" end="01:54:49.459" style="s2">know what I mean right right well and</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.539" end="01:54:51.110" style="s2">that that attack is coming from all</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.459" end="01:54:52.670" style="s2">fronts I mean New York Times just</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.110" end="01:54:55.070" style="s2">recently sort of restating American</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.670" end="01:54:57.650" style="s2">history back to all slavery everything</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.070" end="01:55:00.610" style="s2">Americans I saw I saw that right</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.650" end="01:55:03.229" style="s2">like we should be ashamed of our country</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.610" end="01:55:08.209" style="s2">yeah yeah well if you&#39;re proud of it</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.229" end="01:55:10.280" style="s2">well then you&#39;re now a Nazi how it all</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.209" end="01:55:12.869" style="s2">wraps up together just like that well</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.280" end="01:55:15.059" style="s2">listen Bo we have covered just a million</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.869" end="01:55:18.179" style="s2">different topics but I I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.059" end="01:55:20.189" style="s2">they&#39;re all threaded together in a way</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.179" end="01:55:24.119" style="s2">that sort of provides sort of a coherent</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.189" end="01:55:26.849" style="s2">worldview and and in talking to you it</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.119" end="01:55:28.169" style="s2">only confirmed the fact that we see just</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.849" end="01:55:30.209" style="s2">a tremendous amount of these key</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.169" end="01:55:31.709" style="s2">subjects the same way and I really</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.209" end="01:55:33.629" style="s2">respect and admire the work that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.709" end="01:55:35.869" style="s2">done and I really look forward to</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.629" end="01:55:38.879" style="s2">reading more and talking with you more I</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.869" end="01:55:41.579" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to me that I and the</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.879" end="01:55:44.699" style="s2">people my audience we really like</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.579" end="01:55:47.340" style="s2">evolutionary psych psychologists we</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.699" end="01:55:51.360" style="s2">really like that field because because</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.340" end="01:55:54.959" style="s2">it seems to make a lot of sense and it</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.360" end="01:55:57.329" style="s2">also seems to be a political and outside</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.959" end="01:55:59.610" style="s2">of the fray even though just by paying</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.329" end="01:56:01.919" style="s2">attention to evopsych gear basically</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.610" end="01:56:04.409" style="s2">it&#39;s a political it&#39;s not politicized</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.919" end="01:56:06.840" style="s2">thing anyway because the left obviously</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.409" end="01:56:09.510" style="s2">is issuing all of this this actual</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.840" end="01:56:11.429" style="s2">reality and evolution and stuff but I</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.510" end="01:56:13.649" style="s2">really just want to say thanks I mean</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.429" end="01:56:15.360" style="s2">it&#39;s been two hours and I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:56:15.360" end="01:56:19.309" style="s2">subjects that we didn&#39;t get to which I</p>

<p begin="01:56:19.309" end="01:56:23.939" style="s2">especially when it comes to your writing</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.780" end="01:56:26.189" style="s2">on masculinity and dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.939" end="01:56:27.809" style="s2">and and the mating markets and such like</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.189" end="01:56:30.539" style="s2">that because that&#39;s really where I got</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.809" end="01:56:32.099" style="s2">my start writing was understanding and</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.539" end="01:56:34.229" style="s2">learning about the dating markets from</p>
