<p begin="00:00:06.359" end="00:00:11.639" style="s2">effective conversation because we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">been involved in meetings and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">like them we don&#39;t the more people you</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.470" style="s2">add to a group and the more voices you</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:21.029" style="s2">have to listen to it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.470" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">exponentially harder because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.029" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">has to listen to you when you speak and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">everyone has to have a turn to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">so every person you add exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:33.540" style="s2">adds time to the meeting however with</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">the use of technology and real world</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">word the world cafe has given us a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.290" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">format that works in the real world to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:44.460" style="s2">have a conversation with hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:47.670" style="s2">people you get together in a real space</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.460" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">around cafe like tables in groups of 4</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">to 5 for a set period of time they give</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">20 minutes you have a conversation or in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">a meaningful question and then everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">disperses into the room and you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">that same conversation or an added on</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">conversation with a new question with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">with a new group of people and so with</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">that in that way the larger group is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">also able to have a conversation we with</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">the technology cooperative are going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">create the platform to facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">online so instead of needing to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">physical space at the same place at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">same time you the individual gets to say</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">given people to talk to in tables of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">three to four and you can participate in</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">suggest not staying awake for 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">to continually have a conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">you could there&#39;s gonna be people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">have conversations in multiple languages</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s how the greater world has a</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">and we get to submit and vote on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">those questions are as the users grow as</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">we have thousands and tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">of people we can branch off into areas</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">of expertise if we want to we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">about you could have a question every</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.069" style="s2">day about plastic in the ocean and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">we actually solve it and that group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.069" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">people getting together having those</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">conversations will be able to more</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:24.150" style="s2">effectively create a solution then how</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">we&#39;re all scattered in different</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.150" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">directions and not able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">conversation currently when we start</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">about the technological cooperative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.630" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">greater issues on the planet to see the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">power of a conversation and work out the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">kinks of having a conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:42.090" style="s2">thousand people on existing platforms</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">will have our platform that is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.090" end="00:02:48.329" style="s2">platform to organize and tell people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:51.030" style="s2">where they need to get to but it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.329" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">hosted on existing infrastructure on</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.030" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">zoom&#39; on a pier in on skype on something</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">that already is there so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">spending millions of dollars recreating</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">video conferencing but there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:01.859" style="s2">a time when of course we have to spend</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:03.299" style="s2">that money and create that ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.859" end="00:03:04.890" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want them to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.299" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">take it away or they change a policy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">it will affect us but we can start with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">an app that costs under a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">thousand for sure and helps people sign</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">up say when they&#39;re available the topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">they want to talk about and together we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:23.459" style="s2">can have a meaningful conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">because we&#39;re gonna give you people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.459" end="00:03:28.260" style="s2">talk to and as issues arrive when</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">there&#39;s let&#39;s say conflict we can look</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.260" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">at why that conflict happened we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">look at how we grow and learn through</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:36.389" style="s2">conflict as well as how do we keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">people safe from conflict who don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.389" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">to be in conflict we are going to figure</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">out how to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">thousands of people by having</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:47.069" style="s2">conversations with it&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">smaller group people I mean I want like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.069" end="00:03:50.639" style="s2">five people to work with but then we</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">need to all be available in the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.639" end="00:03:56.639" style="s2">time at the same place and even that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">hard too hard to figure out I constantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.639" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">want to start book clubs and things when</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">I read a book and I&#39;m like wait not</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">everyone&#39;s reading the book at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:05.489" style="s2">time then we have to figure out who</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.739" style="s2">wants to have a conversation around this</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:09.819" style="s2">book at the right time just having that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.739" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">platform just having that to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.819" end="00:04:15.129" style="s2">it helps you create a group around your</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:17.109" style="s2">time in your place and a schedule will</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.129" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">already have a positive positive impact</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.109" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">it&#39;ll be like say Peron I&#39;ll be like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.789" style="s2">Meetup but online and if we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">it with the idea that that same tool can</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.789" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">be used for different things even if in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:32.020" style="s2">the beginning it&#39;s only used for our</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">conversation we can easily create it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.020" end="00:04:36.370" style="s2">every other purpose and have people sign</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:37.780" style="s2">on and say I don&#39;t I don&#39;t care about so</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.780" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">but what would bring meaning to my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.789" end="00:04:45.970" style="s2">is I was able to talk about poverty or</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:47.590" style="s2">trains or planes or penguins I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.009" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">harder to convince people that people</p>
