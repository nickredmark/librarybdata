<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:05.909" style="s2">think that&#39;s important for us to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">thinking about right now because whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.909" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">the Peaks gonna be in late April May</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">June it&#39;s not far off and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">what I&#39;m seeing even from the best state</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">and national leaders is very</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">understandable focus on trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">flatten the curve and dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">shitstorm we have from the rising curve</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">but interestingly the managing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">backside of the curve is gonna be every</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">bit as important in fact maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">important to the long-term social and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">economic health of our country so with</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.849" end="00:02:17.180" style="s2">and then the disruption of of kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.420" end="00:02:19.939" style="s2">it triggers some changes that were sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.180" end="00:02:23.959" style="s2">of provided in the structure of society</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.939" end="00:02:27.909" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to focus</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.609" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.540" end="00:02:59.329" style="s2">society is gonna be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">different than before in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.329" end="00:03:08.090" style="s2">gonna be significant for many people and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:09.859" style="s2">in many ways not good not good for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.090" end="00:03:11.930" style="s2">of people right so that you can see the</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.870" end="00:03:24.829" style="s2">employees are being laid off now and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.229" end="00:03:26.389" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly there&#39;s not be a patent</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.829" end="00:03:28.669" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna get laid off and who listen</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.949" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">desk you know writing documents and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.379" end="00:03:46.909" style="s2">munching spreadsheets pretty much you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:49.579" style="s2">can still do that at home but your</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.909" end="00:03:52.040" style="s2">meetings to zoom calls there&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.579" end="00:03:54.439" style="s2">loss of efficiency due to the you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.040" end="00:03:56.689" style="s2">toddler flinging muck at your head while</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.439" end="00:03:58.549" style="s2">you work at home but you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.689" end="00:04:00.709" style="s2">still operational but if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.549" end="00:04:03.229" style="s2">you&#39;re flipping burgers at McDonald&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.709" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">you know greeting people at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.229" end="00:04:08.449" style="s2">department store or carrying out but</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:10.669" style="s2">various jobs that are just face to face</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.449" end="00:04:13.669" style="s2">human interaction I mean then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.669" end="00:04:16.759" style="s2">really no reason for your employer to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.669" end="00:04:18.349" style="s2">keep you employed during this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.759" end="00:04:20.810" style="s2">flash depression we&#39;re seeing you to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.349" end="00:04:22.520" style="s2">Cove it and indeed your employer</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.810" end="00:04:26.380" style="s2">probably can&#39;t afford to but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.520" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">once the : flash depression is over then</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.380" end="00:04:31.639" style="s2">what happens in some cases you&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:33.500" style="s2">get hired back but in other cases your</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.639" end="00:04:35.870" style="s2">employer will take a fresh look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.500" end="00:04:39.169" style="s2">situation of things like well maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.870" end="00:04:41.750" style="s2">can do more online ongoingly even after</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.169" end="00:04:44.289" style="s2">Koch has gone or maybe maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.750" end="00:04:46.970" style="s2">maybe now is the time to invest in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.289" end="00:04:49.550" style="s2">automation technology to outsource this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.970" end="00:04:52.490" style="s2">or that so I think not all the service</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.550" end="00:04:55.430" style="s2">employees laid off are gonna be rehired</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:58.130" style="s2">and then you know at the same time smart</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.430" end="00:05:00.349" style="s2">investors funds with piles of money</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.130" end="00:05:03.319" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be looking around now and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.349" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">saying well like hey what can i what can</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.319" end="00:05:08.300" style="s2">i buy up at a discount price during this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:11.090" style="s2">Depression because the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:14.120" style="s2">owners to have the money to sustain for</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.090" end="00:05:16.009" style="s2">six months without revenue or you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.120" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">what what comparators can I put out a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.009" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">business because they they can&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">in there on their cash stockpile but but</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:28.340" style="s2">I can so you&#39;re gonna see major</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:31.250" style="s2">consolidation in a variety of industry</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.340" end="00:05:34.009" style="s2">so in short increasing wealth in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.250" end="00:05:38.570" style="s2">hands of the wealthy and more unemployed</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.009" end="00:05:41.539" style="s2">people becoming poorer and poorer at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.570" end="00:05:42.979" style="s2">same time as more power is going to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.539" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">hands of big tech companies and big</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.979" end="00:05:48.620" style="s2">government right because that the tech</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:52.340" style="s2">lash is fading now everyone loves Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.620" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">and ever everyone loves Google and and</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.159" end="00:06:06.259" style="s2">outside world whether they&#39;re stuck at</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.169" end="00:06:08.300" style="s2">home dealing with their suddenly much</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.259" end="00:06:11.380" style="s2">more annoying family members right so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.300" end="00:06:15.259" style="s2">mean tech lash is gone</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.380" end="00:06:19.069" style="s2">no big banks and PE funds they&#39;re owning</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.259" end="00:06:21.830" style="s2">more and more working-class people put</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.069" end="00:06:23.960" style="s2">out of out of work and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:26.449" style="s2">government will slowly put it better and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.960" end="00:06:28.969" style="s2">better surveillance mechanisms sucking</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.449" end="00:06:31.610" style="s2">data from big tech so as to better</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.969" end="00:06:33.500" style="s2">monitor the pandemic but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.610" end="00:06:35.900" style="s2">whatever monitoring they put in place</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.500" end="00:06:37.550" style="s2">for the pandemic is gonna keep going</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.900" end="00:06:42.050" style="s2">right so we&#39;re looking toward more and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.550" end="00:06:45.229" style="s2">more of a sort of a fascist oligopoly</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.050" end="00:06:46.430" style="s2">and oligarchy which is kind of what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.229" end="00:06:49.939" style="s2">already have but we&#39;re acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.430" end="00:06:53.870" style="s2">further and further in in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.939" end="00:06:55.250" style="s2">once this pandemic is gone at least no</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.870" end="00:06:57.650" style="s2">none of us knows what the hell is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.250" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">happen but that seems like sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.650" end="00:07:03.610" style="s2">the most likely course unless so they</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:07.490" style="s2">even worse happens or unless some of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.610" end="00:07:11.210" style="s2">crazy hackers and then freaks managed to</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.579" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">mean I think you&#39;re right that like if V</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.700" end="00:09:14.010" style="s2">sees get used to closing investment</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:16.769" style="s2">deals buy a conference call then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.010" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">gonna know like yeah I can close</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">so we don&#39;t always need to wait in order</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.019" end="00:09:25.829" style="s2">to for someone to meet face to face in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:27.959" style="s2">order to do it right so that I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.829" end="00:09:29.640" style="s2">that could be a genuine acceleration and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.959" end="00:09:32.730" style="s2">efficiency improvement because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.640" end="00:09:34.470" style="s2">now now you have beasties and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:37.079" style="s2">valley vine to close a deal with some</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.470" end="00:09:39.450" style="s2">hot startup in uh no New York or Atlanta</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">that then you know the competition will</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:52.230" style="s2">happen in a bunch of video calls and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">things will happen even even faster so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.230" end="00:09:56.910" style="s2">think yeah there definitely will be</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:09:58.589" style="s2">cases like that on the other hand as</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.589" end="00:10:05.670" style="s2">I can see that the sort of connections</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:08.310" style="s2">you make at conferences and events isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.670" end="00:10:10.470" style="s2">happening now I mean what the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.310" end="00:10:12.870" style="s2">networking one can do now is great for</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.370" end="00:10:48.209" style="s2">and in October so I mean one test will</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.699" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">be you know how much of these events</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.209" end="00:10:51.510" style="s2">that were supposed to be in spring</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:53.550" style="s2">postponed till September and October</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.510" end="00:10:56.220" style="s2">like how much are they flooded with</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.550" end="00:10:58.050" style="s2">people and I think I think as soon in</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.050" end="00:11:03.869" style="s2">astoundingly with people I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.529" end="00:11:05.970" style="s2">a good distinction between conferences</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.869" end="00:11:08.009" style="s2">and just routine business travel which</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.970" end="00:11:10.439" style="s2">there&#39;s so goddamn much I think so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.009" end="00:11:12.839" style="s2">won&#39;t be binary but let&#39;s move on to the</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.720" end="00:12:20.899" style="s2">lot of live music clubs in Seattle where</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.689" end="00:12:23.069" style="s2">I know the musicians who play their</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.069" end="00:12:27.299" style="s2">shutting down though because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">gigs and no audiences but most of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.299" end="00:12:30.899" style="s2">guys aren&#39;t gonna start new live music</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:33.829" style="s2">clubs it was pretty marginal in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.899" end="00:12:36.540" style="s2">first place right so you could see a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.829" end="00:12:40.259" style="s2">whole new crop of little loud music</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.540" end="00:12:42.299" style="s2">venues pop up but I&#39;m um I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.259" end="00:12:43.980" style="s2">dabbing it actually actually actually so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.299" end="00:12:46.169" style="s2">that I think yeah there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.980" end="00:12:49.019" style="s2">things that we&#39;re waiting to happen and</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.530" end="00:13:41.940" style="s2">in their home so maybe we&#39;ll see a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.660" end="00:13:44.340" style="s2">reconfiguration more strongly to those</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.940" end="00:13:46.980" style="s2">home concerts I mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.340" end="00:13:49.530" style="s2">ways things could happen and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.980" end="00:13:53.220" style="s2">you can play outdoors in a public park</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.530" end="00:13:55.650" style="s2">whether what where the climate is warm</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.220" end="00:13:58.860" style="s2">you can you can plan it in a restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.650" end="00:14:02.670" style="s2">right but I guess the common trend will</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.860" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">be this shift will be took things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.670" end="00:14:10.830" style="s2">are lower costs to operate and involve</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.410" end="00:14:14.220" style="s2">less you know working-class human labor</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.830" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna be I would say a common</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.220" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">denominator among these things and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:21.690" style="s2">shifting to home concerts is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:24.270" style="s2">then again to shift toward the gig</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.690" end="00:14:26.850" style="s2">economy right okay the guy who&#39;s Houston</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.270" end="00:14:29.100" style="s2">is is temporarily like playing the role</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.850" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">that would be would be plagued by the by</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.100" end="00:14:34.380" style="s2">the club owner but probably making less</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:36.180" style="s2">money than the club owner does the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.380" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">game has no cost right has no variable</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.180" end="00:14:40.590" style="s2">cost it has that yeah so it actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:43.140" style="s2">ends up being more profitable but just</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.590" end="00:14:45.390" style="s2">it reconfigures how assets are used and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.140" end="00:14:47.400" style="s2">this shock will cause a lot of that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.390" end="00:14:48.780" style="s2">you know I&#39;m suggesting to people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.400" end="00:14:50.010" style="s2">really want to think about the back side</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.780" end="00:14:51.480" style="s2">of the curve which is coming very</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.010" end="00:14:54.330" style="s2">rapidly I have to keep reminding people</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.480" end="00:14:58.110" style="s2">of that this peak will be you know late</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.330" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">April May June maybe and the backs</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.110" end="00:15:01.410" style="s2">managing the back side of the curb is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:04.170" style="s2">gonna be a much bigger and more</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.410" end="00:15:05.820" style="s2">important task for society than trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.170" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">to flatten the curve is because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.820" end="00:15:10.920" style="s2">you know we&#39;re very much Adelina</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">go ahead so the case the case of music</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.920" end="00:15:17.730" style="s2">concerts is one where it may all be fun</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.590" style="s2">anyway like we&#39;ve already gotten rid of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.730" end="00:15:20.850" style="s2">Tower Records and so on you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.590" end="00:15:24.060" style="s2">distribute your music through the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.850" end="00:15:26.900" style="s2">internet and you can play locally and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.060" end="00:15:30.810" style="s2">somebody&#39;s backyard now the case of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.900" end="00:15:34.580" style="s2">retail supply chains and of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.810" end="00:15:37.080" style="s2">retail being reduced to only like</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.580" end="00:15:39.990" style="s2">Walmart Don and and Target or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.080" end="00:15:42.210" style="s2">I mean this this comes down to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.990" end="00:15:44.430" style="s2">corporate hegemony thing where than if</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.210" end="00:15:46.080" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re selling a product but</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.430" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">none of these outlets want to sell</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.080" end="00:15:51.770" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to get it to anyone right</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">and so I mean I mean in a lot of domains</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.770" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen things narrow focus to just</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:01.260" style="s2">a few outlets so it almost becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:03.300" style="s2">a variant of that the dreaded old</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.260" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">communist system where you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.300" end="00:16:06.960" style="s2">buy everything online from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:10.470" style="s2">government&#39;s reach out or something and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.960" end="00:16:12.030" style="s2">these of course these big tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.470" end="00:16:14.970" style="s2">that are monopolizing things large</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.030" end="00:16:16.680" style="s2">retailers they are in fact closely tied</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.970" end="00:16:20.010" style="s2">with the government for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:22.710" style="s2">like I&#39;m an Amazon and Microsoft putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.010" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">huge news server farms right right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.710" end="00:16:28.410" style="s2">and bodies of staff right next to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:31.770" style="s2">Pentagon so I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.410" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">through the combination of social</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.770" end="00:16:38.510" style="s2">factors like this Kovach pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">then just economies of scale in</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.510" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">technology I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:48.470" style="s2">toward an oligopoly that is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:51.090" style="s2">break without busting out of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.470" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">traditional ways of doing things right</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.090" end="00:16:55.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:16:58.200" style="s2">frustrating to me as something who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.650" end="00:17:01.550" style="s2">been you know participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.200" end="00:17:04.700" style="s2">blockchain and crypto ecosystem through</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.550" end="00:17:07.740" style="s2">singularly net which is the AI based</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.700" end="00:17:09.180" style="s2">blocking base a marketplace I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">working on for the last couple years I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.180" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">mean crypto and blockchain were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:18.270" style="s2">supposed to be forming alternatives to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:19.890" style="s2">all these centralized hegemonic methods</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.270" end="00:17:22.020" style="s2">right like when when there was a global</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.890" end="00:17:24.750" style="s2">financial crisis it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.020" end="00:17:26.970" style="s2">Bitcoin that comes out as as the new</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.750" end="00:17:29.850" style="s2">gold or the new global reserve currency</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.970" end="00:17:31.560" style="s2">or something in them instead of Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.850" end="00:17:35.460" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to have some</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.560" end="00:17:36.370" style="s2">decentralized token based system for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.460" end="00:17:39.040" style="s2">know a small side</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.370" end="00:17:41.320" style="s2">some things to customers with a smart</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.040" end="00:17:44.350" style="s2">decentralized reputation system and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.320" end="00:17:46.990" style="s2">you know as it is happening when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.350" end="00:17:48.690" style="s2">worlds in this situation where this sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.990" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">of thing would really really be useful</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.690" end="00:17:54.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not ready for primetime right I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:17:56.890" style="s2">mean the US dollar is supreme again the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.670" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">flight to quality look like always in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.890" end="00:18:04.200" style="s2">the financial crunch and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:07.150" style="s2">decentralized market places are very</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.200" end="00:18:09.490" style="s2">either very specialized or just too</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.150" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">crude to do anything and if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.490" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">ultimately if you need to order a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:17.770" style="s2">of stuff you got a good Amazon present</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:21.750" style="s2">the question is like bye-bye the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.770" end="00:18:25.030" style="s2">big crisis being a pandemic or like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.750" end="00:18:26.590" style="s2">global rash of of cyber attacks bringing</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.030" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">down the power grid or whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.590" end="00:18:30.550" style="s2">whatever the big next crisis is and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:34.540" style="s2">there probably will be one right then</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.550" end="00:18:36.670" style="s2">then will alternative mechanisms be</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.540" end="00:18:39.309" style="s2">there yet to even be part of this story</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.670" end="00:18:41.830" style="s2">is now in the current crisis they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.309" end="00:18:43.929" style="s2">really part of this story unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.830" end="00:18:45.190" style="s2">that is true you know again you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.929" end="00:18:47.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on this thing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.190" end="00:18:50.380" style="s2">some friends called game B which is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.020" end="00:18:53.230" style="s2">still fairly sketchy vague I should say</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.380" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">new social operating system operating</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.230" end="00:18:57.429" style="s2">with much more localism much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:19:00.070" style="s2">ability to sever the networks without</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.429" end="00:19:02.200" style="s2">bad things happening etc but we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.070" end="00:19:04.420" style="s2">know still years away from being ready</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.200" end="00:19:07.030" style="s2">to be an alternative social operating</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.420" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">system so I&#39;m taking this as a wake-up</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.030" end="00:19:12.610" style="s2">call rather than saying we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:14.170" style="s2">30 or 40 years to figure it out I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.610" end="00:19:15.400" style="s2">least taking it as a personal mission to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.170" end="00:19:17.110" style="s2">say we got to figure this thing out</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.400" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">before the next one I think your you</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.110" end="00:19:20.230" style="s2">know your point is well-taken</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:23.080" style="s2">none of the also that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.230" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">right how many how many people will take</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.080" end="00:19:29.530" style="s2">this as a wake-up call in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:31.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s not entirely clear right I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.530" end="00:19:34.090" style="s2">mean like you know of course what</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.660" end="00:19:35.530" style="s2">happened to dusty as ski the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.090" end="00:19:38.950" style="s2">Roger like he was putting from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.530" end="00:19:40.990" style="s2">firing squad goes home to his head then</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:43.570" style="s2">you know they fired it it turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.990" end="00:19:45.970" style="s2">be blanks and after coming back close to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.570" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">death you know after that he&#39;s like wow</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.970" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">every minute</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:53.379" style="s2">is amazing what like life is wonderful I</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:55.330" style="s2">will cherish each moment and that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.379" end="00:19:56.740" style="s2">lasted like six months or something for</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.330" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">them then you went back to grumbling</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.740" end="00:20:01.720" style="s2">about how knowing life is like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s the homeostasis right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.720" end="00:20:08.500" style="s2">that the question is how many people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:10.600" style="s2">are getting a wake-up call now will get</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.500" end="00:20:12.070" style="s2">it go to sleep cause six months late and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.600" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">when things seem to be back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.070" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s what happens after</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:19.330" style="s2">every financial bubble and financial</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:21.580" style="s2">crash right after another six months or</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.330" end="00:20:24.909" style="s2">year people start thinking again that</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.909" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">yeah and here&#39;s my view on this I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.519" style="s2">been thinking about this hard which is I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.769" style="s2">do not believe this is the revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.519" end="00:20:35.620" style="s2">time for the reasons you articulated</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.769" end="00:20:39.460" style="s2">that the infrastructure just isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.620" end="00:20:41.500" style="s2">yet however a lot of people are being</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.460" end="00:20:44.649" style="s2">woken up I&#39;m talking to a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.500" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">and so I believe this epoch post the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.649" end="00:20:48.070" style="s2">back side of the curve in the next six</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:50.379" style="s2">months that&#39;s a good time this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.070" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">time to build the cadre we may be able</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.379" end="00:20:55.389" style="s2">to build the cadre by a factor of ten or</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:58.659" style="s2">twenty people whose ears have been open</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.389" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">by this big basically force applied to</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.659" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">them they&#39;ve been forced to think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:04.450" style="s2">life and death for the first time ever</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:07.059" style="s2">in their life for a lot of men that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.450" end="00:21:09.370" style="s2">Americans and so basically many more</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.059" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">ears will be open so I personally and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.370" end="00:21:15.370" style="s2">people I know are gonna be putting forth</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:17.080" style="s2">a blitz to try to recruit grow our cadre</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.370" end="00:21:19.179" style="s2">which we might call our game be spaced</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.080" end="00:21:21.190" style="s2">10,000 people let&#39;s see if we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.179" end="00:21:23.860" style="s2">into a quarter million by the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.190" end="00:21:25.299" style="s2">year and then from that basis there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.860" end="00:21:28.509" style="s2">be enough skill sets and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.299" end="00:21:31.539" style="s2">enough leaders that perhaps we can build</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.509" end="00:21:33.399" style="s2">a faster route to spin up so that when</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.539" end="00:21:37.029" style="s2">the next crisis comes and it is coming</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.370" end="00:21:45.519" style="s2">I mean I think people have been woken up</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.549" end="00:21:50.110" style="s2">to some extent to the fact that things</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.519" end="00:21:53.139" style="s2">aren&#39;t quite as stable predictable and</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.440" end="00:22:01.150" style="s2">obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.910" end="00:22:02.950" style="s2">the status quo is kind of fragile and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.150" end="00:22:05.710" style="s2">then you could have a massive disruption</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.950" end="00:22:08.710" style="s2">at any time but most people&#39;s don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.710" end="00:22:10.810" style="s2">think that way and their minds are blown</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.270" end="00:24:56.070" style="s2">in particular is I&#39;ll confess it has</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:59.590" style="s2">sort of a hippie dippie flavor</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.070" end="00:25:02.230" style="s2">decentralized building proto bees that</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.110" end="00:25:16.090" style="s2">necessarily a great way to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:18.760" style="s2">respond in real-time decisively against</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.090" end="00:25:19.830" style="s2">the crisis so I think a challenge to all</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.760" end="00:25:22.299" style="s2">of us who are thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.830" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">decentralized social operating systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.299" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">we need need now to use this event and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:32.830" style="s2">would also postulate a more severe</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">version and we essentially say that our</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.830" end="00:25:37.419" style="s2">decentralized social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:39.450" style="s2">needs to be able to have the near</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.450" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">capabilities like this I think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.960" end="00:25:49.780" style="s2">current US response to come in nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.919" end="00:25:51.700" style="s2">industries very well the weakness of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.780" end="00:25:55.900" style="s2">centralized control systems right</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.700" end="00:25:59.500" style="s2">because I mean you you have a food in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:26:01.510" style="s2">chief in charge of the US who is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.500" end="00:26:04.740" style="s2">centerpiece of a centralized control</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.510" end="00:26:07.539" style="s2">system and because that one component is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.740" end="00:26:09.580" style="s2">cognitively and emotionally faulty I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.539" end="00:26:12.820" style="s2">mean then the response of the whole US</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.580" end="00:26:15.370" style="s2">system was slower than it should have</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.820" end="00:26:17.110" style="s2">been and China&#39;s response demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.370" end="00:26:19.320" style="s2">the same thing right I mean at the top</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.110" end="00:26:21.429" style="s2">they had a system for suppressing</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.320" end="00:26:23.830" style="s2">freedom of press and freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.429" end="00:26:24.340" style="s2">information and the top level of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.340" end="00:26:28.750" style="s2">control system caused the initial</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.350" end="00:26:31.240" style="s2">response to be too slow even though the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.750" end="00:26:34.299" style="s2">response of China a little afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.240" end="00:26:37.630" style="s2">became became highly efficient in many</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.299" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">ways so yeah I think it&#39;s clear that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.630" end="00:26:43.779" style="s2">well-crafted decentralized response</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">system can be much much better than the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.779" end="00:26:48.340" style="s2">centralized systems we have we have now</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:51.429" style="s2">for the exact reason that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.340" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">centralized system is is too too</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.429" end="00:26:57.370" style="s2">susceptible to failing to the witnesses</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">at the center which is exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.370" end="00:27:04.409" style="s2">what we&#39;ve we&#39;ve seen but you do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:07.659" style="s2">you need a effective well-designed</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.409" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">decentralized system not as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.659" end="00:27:13.630" style="s2">designed but fully implemented and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:15.909" style="s2">tested and and unfortunately we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.630" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">have that yet not because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.909" end="00:27:19.770" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:22.570" style="s2">technologically or conceptually just as</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.770" end="00:27:24.909" style="s2">insanely much more resources have gone</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.570" end="00:27:27.669" style="s2">into creating and maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.909" end="00:27:29.409" style="s2">centralized systems because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.669" end="00:27:32.020" style="s2">resources are controlled by the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.409" end="00:27:34.149" style="s2">in power of the central us exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.020" end="00:27:36.309" style="s2">do we get the D central I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.149" end="00:27:38.770" style="s2">absolutely agree with you that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.309" end="00:27:42.190" style="s2">demonstration of the failure of game a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.770" end="00:27:44.409" style="s2">and its over reliance on a single faulty</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.190" end="00:27:47.470" style="s2">part and of course it&#39;s not just in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.409" end="00:27:49.779" style="s2">u.s. most of the West has also failed</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.470" end="00:27:52.779" style="s2">you know Italy and Spain looks like</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.779" end="00:27:54.610" style="s2">England and France are also gonna suffer</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.779" end="00:27:57.730" style="s2">hard Sweden&#39;s not doing well so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.610" end="00:28:00.760" style="s2">just our own faulty part there&#39;s uh you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.730" end="00:28:03.429" style="s2">know you&#39;re right and in the Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.760" end="00:28:06.549" style="s2">just an especially colorful example but</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.429" end="00:28:08.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a systemic you know I do</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.549" end="00:28:09.880" style="s2">agree that&#39;s that the centralized</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.289" end="00:28:11.380" style="s2">systems ought to do better but we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.880" end="00:28:13.029" style="s2">to start thinking about them in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.380" end="00:28:15.220" style="s2">dealing with problems of this magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.029" end="00:28:17.110" style="s2">not just in a hippie-dippie way how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.220" end="00:28:19.000" style="s2">live our life in a better way and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.110" end="00:28:21.010" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of my big takeaways in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.000" end="00:28:23.080" style="s2">one of my communications obligations</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.010" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">going forward is to make sure that what</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.080" end="00:28:25.929" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about these protocols and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">I know you guys have been doing that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.929" end="00:28:30.580" style="s2">your singularity that you know how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">deal with the biggest problems you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.580" end="00:28:36.549" style="s2">say lian&#39;s and may the earth or you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:37.390" style="s2">a true yeah you&#39;re right I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.549" end="00:28:38.830" style="s2">wanna</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.390" end="00:28:41.530" style="s2">want to appear to all the reptile</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.830" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">emotions so we will appeal to lust but</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.530" end="00:28:48.790" style="s2">also to to fear right so I mean that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:51.730" style="s2">think and people sort of they they need</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.790" end="00:28:53.470" style="s2">to understand all the dimensions of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.730" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">situation or that respond appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.470" end="00:29:01.929" style="s2">and understanding not only how wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:04.900" style="s2">an anarchist utopia we can create with</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.929" end="00:29:08.470" style="s2">decentralized tools and methods but also</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.900" end="00:29:10.150" style="s2">how scary the world can be if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.470" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">have those decentralized methods to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.150" end="00:29:15.880" style="s2">protect us from a bunch of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:18.070" style="s2">all all these aspects are important to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.880" end="00:29:20.500" style="s2">appealing to human motivational systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.070" end="00:29:21.730" style="s2">right which is which is what is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.500" end="00:29:24.220" style="s2">needs to be done if we&#39;re gonna leverage</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.730" end="00:29:26.140" style="s2">human energy because it&#39;s toward</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.220" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">building an alternative to decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.140" end="00:29:30.940" style="s2">systems and control the world now</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">because it you know it&#39;s very possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.940" end="00:29:37.860" style="s2">to create decentralized networks that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:40.929" style="s2">work much much more efficiently than the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.860" end="00:29:43.270" style="s2">centralized systems controlling the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.929" end="00:29:45.820" style="s2">world now but it is hard right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:49.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s really even something</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.820" end="00:29:51.730" style="s2">is as simple as you know a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.210" end="00:29:53.350" style="s2">efficient payment system which the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.730" end="00:29:56.260" style="s2">crypto world is working on for a long</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.350" end="00:29:59.350" style="s2">time I mean it&#39;s true that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.260" end="00:30:02.020" style="s2">but there&#39;s just a lot of algorithm and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.350" end="00:30:04.090" style="s2">implementation work to be done there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.020" end="00:30:06.400" style="s2">and to make a whole decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.090" end="00:30:07.960" style="s2">operating system for the world there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.400" end="00:30:10.030" style="s2">whole lot of pieces like that that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.960" end="00:30:11.590" style="s2">have to all have to work together we</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.030" end="00:30:14.110" style="s2">absolutely have the technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.590" end="00:30:17.140" style="s2">brainpower on the planet to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.110" end="00:30:19.570" style="s2">with people need to be energized and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.140" end="00:30:23.940" style="s2">motivated in that Anette directions so</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.570" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">yeah if this pandemic serves to wake up</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:29.980" style="s2">enough people with relevant skills and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">resources to the the need for building</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.980" end="00:30:35.890" style="s2">it and alternative decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:37.990" style="s2">infrastructure I mean then then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.890" end="00:30:40.600" style="s2">pandemic in hindsight will appear like</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.990" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">an extremely positive thing for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.600" end="00:30:45.130" style="s2">evolution of humanity let&#39;s end it right</p>
