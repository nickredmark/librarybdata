<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.510" style="s2">it may go all the way down to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.979" end="00:00:06.180" style="s2">subatomic level that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.510" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">built-in mechanism that we express and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.180" end="00:00:13.410" style="s2">we we talk about it as desire but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">actually looks a lot more fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.410" end="00:00:18.930" style="s2">me than a word like desire this is real</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:21.990" style="s2">interesting now I don&#39;t know how much as</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:24.990" style="s2">a matter of content if your show kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">goes into the deeply as a terror but</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.990" end="00:00:29.099" style="s2">week a week that&#39;s the rabbit hole I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">dive in real quick sure here it is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.099" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">so so one of the ways that I that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">thought about it and this is and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:38.670" style="s2">basically just applying a framework that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:42.629" style="s2">I&#39;ve used in the past that seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.670" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">might roughly fit not to over code the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.629" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">domain were at but maybe get some some</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">directions I&#39;m gonna get some</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">orientation on it is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">distinction that I&#39;ve made between what</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve got what I call the rival wrist in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">the ante rivalries which Maps roughly to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">atoms and bits as it turns out which by</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">the way we should be very clear the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.710" style="s2">third term here which we might consider</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">energy to be a process or a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.710" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">between the two so atoms bits and energy</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:15.090" style="s2">feels like that&#39;s a pretty solid</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">constellation and we you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.090" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">characteristic of the rival lists is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">that is that it is rivalry a desire</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">competitive desire exactly at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">the day there are certain aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">physical universe of which physics is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">largely the thing the branch of science</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">that is that universe that are are at</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">the bottom strictly not shareable both</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">in the sense that they are atomic mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">if you have it I don&#39;t have it in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">sense and an entropic means that that to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">the degree to which you interact with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">in any way you turn the free energy into</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:57.509" style="s2">entropy you&#39;ve depleted it permanently</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">in a one-way direction so there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.509" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">certain aspects of the universe the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">things that are studied by physics that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">have those characteristics and around</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">those aspects you would imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">they would evolve for example a as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:14.230" style="s2">fundamental characteristic of any system</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:16.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.230" end="00:02:18.490" style="s2">sorry I have to back up there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.280" end="00:02:21.320" style="s2">component here which has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.490" end="00:02:23.210" style="s2">irreducible necessity of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.320" end="00:02:24.920" style="s2">accumulate an upgrade Ian of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.210" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">particular scarce fundamental scarce</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.920" end="00:02:30.500" style="s2">aspect of reality in order to perpetuate</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:31.940" style="s2">dissipative systems right so we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.500" end="00:02:33.800" style="s2">another thing here which I think you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.940" end="00:02:38.780" style="s2">just channeled there for a second I see</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.800" end="00:02:41.900" style="s2">that yeah trying to think real deep oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.780" end="00:02:45.230" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s good the way this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.900" end="00:02:47.570" style="s2">actually a secret but I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.230" end="00:02:52.430" style="s2">much a synesthete and I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.570" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">think in words and so when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.430" end="00:02:58.460" style="s2">that what I&#39;m actually doing is trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:02:59.960" style="s2">to hold a particular I kind of refer to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.460" end="00:03:03.140" style="s2">as a geometry but it&#39;s almost a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.960" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">bit more like you ever seen those</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:07.430" style="s2">puzzles that are a 3d puzzle but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:10.130" style="s2">looking at it on a computer screen so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.430" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">it&#39;s 2d right yeah you have to rotate it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.130" end="00:03:14.060" style="s2">and orient it until the 3d system it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:15.350" style="s2">pops and you see the 3d model yeah a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.060" end="00:03:16.550" style="s2">like that like I&#39;m actually moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.350" end="00:03:19.820" style="s2">things and some I don&#39;t know some</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.550" end="00:03:21.260" style="s2">interior spaces but once it locks then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.820" end="00:03:22.459" style="s2">have to hold it because it&#39;s not easy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.260" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">hold but once I hold it then I actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.459" end="00:03:24.489" style="s2">starts figuring how to pull the words</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:27.020" style="s2">out that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.489" end="00:03:30.709" style="s2">map to the thing but the things the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.020" end="00:03:33.830" style="s2">thing and that may very well be what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.709" end="00:03:35.209" style="s2">referred to as channeling but yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.830" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">was that little bit right there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.209" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">nice chunk of stuff I&#39;m reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.150" end="00:03:42.860" style="s2">confident and okay so you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">you&#39;ve got dissipative systems and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.860" end="00:03:47.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the the reality that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:49.160" style="s2">essentially a binary in dissipative</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.480" end="00:03:51.800" style="s2">systems which is to say that either they</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.160" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">are what the lawyers would call heya</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.800" end="00:03:56.630" style="s2">cities you might meet a simpler term</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:58.910" style="s2">would be ephemeral like a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.630" end="00:04:01.010" style="s2">a Scirocco or a little breeze you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.910" end="00:04:03.230" style="s2">it comes around and it goes away</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.010" end="00:04:07.540" style="s2">that&#39;s it evaporate and then that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.230" end="00:04:09.769" style="s2">are others that have a capacity to pull</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.540" end="00:04:12.110" style="s2">resources from their external</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.769" end="00:04:14.830" style="s2">environment which now by definition are</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.110" end="00:04:18.549" style="s2">going to be rivalries resources to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.830" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">perpetuate their being what they are a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.549" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">pattern that has the capacity to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.500" end="00:04:26.270" style="s2">itself over time I&#39;m pulling a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:27.970" style="s2">right now a lot of Dolores and to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.270" end="00:04:30.740" style="s2">lesser extent a lot into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:32.229" style="s2">so you know and this by the way I had</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.740" end="00:04:34.849" style="s2">this conversation with Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.229" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">about 12 years ago we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.849" end="00:04:38.990" style="s2">discussing ethics we got down to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:44.120" style="s2">very bottom which is okay we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.990" end="00:04:46.280" style="s2">make a proposition that we have a habit</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.120" end="00:04:49.909" style="s2">of thought which is based on simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.280" end="00:04:53.659" style="s2">survivor&#39;s bias we happen to be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.909" end="00:04:56.180" style="s2">leading edge of a 13.7 billion year</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.659" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">survivor&#39;s bias those set that tiny</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.180" end="00:04:59.960" style="s2">subset of all possible phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t just evaporate back into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.960" end="00:05:05.479" style="s2">quantum phone and then you know so then</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:07.460" style="s2">started getting atoms and the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.479" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">became molecules and didn&#39;t evaporate</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.460" end="00:05:12.530" style="s2">back into the atomic you know maelstrom</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">and the molecules became organic</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.530" end="00:05:15.620" style="s2">molecules didn&#39;t just evaporate back</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:17.300" style="s2">where it&#39;s that structural development</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.620" end="00:05:19.550" style="s2">where&#39;s this we have the survivors bias</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.300" end="00:05:20.810" style="s2">of that and now kind of channel little</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.550" end="00:05:22.129" style="s2">bit of Jordan Peterson here if you plug</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.810" end="00:05:24.229" style="s2">him into that structure you&#39;re like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.129" end="00:05:26.180" style="s2">and the narratives and Mister poetics</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.229" end="00:05:28.430" style="s2">and ethos and values that we happen to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.180" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">have sitting you know that we sit on top</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.430" end="00:05:35.719" style="s2">of are an expression of that entire arc</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">of which now we can plug mimetic desire</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.719" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">is a real deep piece of that which</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.330" end="00:05:46.669" style="s2">probably goes all the way down to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:49.069" style="s2">struggle between quarks to be the ones</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.669" end="00:05:51.020" style="s2">that actually turn into atoms right</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.069" end="00:05:53.779" style="s2">right there at that pivot point between</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.020" end="00:05:56.599" style="s2">to be and not to be or to continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.779" end="00:05:58.819" style="s2">to become in becoming or to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.599" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">nothingness again is probably the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.819" end="00:06:02.810" style="s2">pivot point and if you anchor there pull</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:04.819" style="s2">all the way back out and can hold</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.810" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">continuity from the quantum foam all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.819" end="00:06:08.840" style="s2">way up to you know complex cultures I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:10.129" style="s2">think then you&#39;ve got a very fair frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.840" end="00:06:12.889" style="s2">to actually start really talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.129" end="00:06:14.599" style="s2">the sorority and inside but to remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.889" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">that you&#39;re holding that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.599" end="00:06:17.389" style="s2">reality which is the piece of reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:18.889" style="s2">that&#39;s talking about the rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.389" end="00:06:22.129" style="s2">talking about these characteristics of</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.129" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">we have to talk about the the other side</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.569" end="00:06:30.620" style="s2">which has to do with creativity</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:13.819" style="s2">evolution theory it has to have at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.819" end="00:07:16.250" style="s2">some notion that you can actually you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.819" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">actually can go from 0 to 1 you can go</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.250" end="00:07:22.879" style="s2">from what is to an entirely novel and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.580" end="00:07:25.370" style="s2">some in time some kind of actual novelty</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.699" end="00:07:33.500" style="s2">other piece i Novation cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">strictly rivalries because at the very</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.500" end="00:07:36.199" style="s2">beginning you&#39;re literally going from</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.430" end="00:07:40.700" style="s2">zero to one you are in fact creating</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.199" end="00:07:45.770" style="s2">mortis that piece is the piece that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.700" end="00:07:47.900" style="s2">not fully captured in purely mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.770" end="00:07:49.550" style="s2">desire because you you&#39;re actually</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.550" end="00:07:52.250" style="s2">there so that would be the other the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.020" end="00:07:56.780" style="s2">other piece that I would lay her in to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.250" end="00:07:59.090" style="s2">get a fully rich theory things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.780" end="00:08:02.090" style="s2">got things like scarcity and then this</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.090" end="00:08:06.020" style="s2">idea of maybe post scarcity here this</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.090" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">ideally I&#39;m thinking of the the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.020" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">story of Jesus when he&#39;s handing out the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:12.230" style="s2">fishes and loaves and he takes these</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">fishes and loaves but they just keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.230" end="00:08:16.310" style="s2">coming he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t cut the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:17.870" style="s2">fish up into piece and I able to get a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.310" end="00:08:20.480" style="s2">little a little meat here no he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.870" end="00:08:23.690" style="s2">like no and it&#39;s this this declaration</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.480" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">of war against scarcity and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.690" end="00:08:28.100" style="s2">require it doesn&#39;t require coercion to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:31.040" style="s2">do he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t say all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.100" end="00:08:33.800" style="s2">I&#39;m forcing you to give me your food he</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.040" end="00:08:36.400" style="s2">just voluntary exchange and from that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:39.560" style="s2">voluntary exchange there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.400" end="00:08:42.410" style="s2">renunciation of the confining power of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.560" end="00:08:44.830" style="s2">scarcity right well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.410" end="00:08:48.050" style="s2">creativity without conflict right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.830" end="00:08:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s creativity as generativity and as</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.050" end="00:08:50.630" style="s2">you notice there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.280" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">characteristics like if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.630" end="00:08:57.260" style="s2">that particular parable there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:09:00.290" style="s2">mentality there&#39;s a premise there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.260" end="00:09:01.670" style="s2">commitment it&#39;s a piece for example yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.290" end="00:09:03.860" style="s2">you can&#39;t in fact have generativity</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.670" end="00:09:05.480" style="s2">outside of peace peace is the space</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.860" end="00:09:08.300" style="s2">which gives rise to the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.480" end="00:09:10.070" style="s2">true collaboration once you&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.300" end="00:09:12.530" style="s2">peace you then have achieved the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.070" end="00:09:16.100" style="s2">capacity to shift from a scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.530" end="00:09:19.400" style="s2">dynamic to an abundance dynamic plent</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.100" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">plenitude as a secondary air artifact</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.400" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">and I&#39;m making that distinction so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:29.450" style="s2">I think of I think of there being a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.089" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">scarcity mentality in it attached to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.450" end="00:09:33.860" style="s2">scarcity mentality and we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.910" end="00:09:37.370" style="s2">use we have shifting to the mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.860" end="00:09:38.750" style="s2">I would tag the character of Mammon so</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.370" end="00:09:41.260" style="s2">Mammon is what happens when you operate</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.750" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2">with the scarcity mentality but x</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.260" end="00:09:49.459" style="s2">grotesquerie so you know the Jabba the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:51.800" style="s2">Hutt character Jabba the Hutt is has too</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.459" end="00:09:53.300" style="s2">much but still is tied to a scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.800" end="00:09:55.270" style="s2">mentality and it&#39;s trying to plug the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.300" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">hole of scarcity through getting more</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.270" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong answer then you got</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:00.860" style="s2">another thing over here which we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:02.540" style="s2">talk about Jesus and the parable which</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.860" end="00:10:04.910" style="s2">is to say no we&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.540" end="00:10:06.529" style="s2">move into the abundance mentality we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.910" end="00:10:08.740" style="s2">going to move into a space that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.529" end="00:10:11.180" style="s2">anchored in a fundamental sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.740" end="00:10:12.740" style="s2">orienting towards this other domain the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.180" end="00:10:14.600" style="s2">domain of creativity domain of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.740" end="00:10:17.660" style="s2">generativity the germane domain of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:19.610" style="s2">Novation which first and foremost has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:21.020" style="s2">be held in a space of peace but once</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.610" end="00:10:23.000" style="s2">we&#39;re in that space we recognize a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.020" end="00:10:25.070" style="s2">renowned a place its place of plenitude</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.000" end="00:10:27.140" style="s2">we&#39;re just necessarily even vaguely look</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.070" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">like Jabba the Hutt next looks nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.140" end="00:10:30.829" style="s2">at all like that there&#39;s like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:32.089" style="s2">bunch of people who have actually have</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.829" end="00:10:33.620" style="s2">to be conscious of the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.089" end="00:10:35.870" style="s2">and to maintain the integrity of peace</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.620" end="00:10:37.250" style="s2">is the first thing you have to do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.870" end="00:10:39.110" style="s2">the beginning you can&#39;t maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.250" end="00:10:40.730" style="s2">integrity of peace and then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.110" end="00:10:42.740" style="s2">plenitude evaporates and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.730" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">each of us as an individual has to start</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.740" end="00:10:48.380" style="s2">taking responsibility for only taking</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:50.390" style="s2">that piece of the piece that is ours and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.380" end="00:10:52.310" style="s2">to carry the cross the desires to carry</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.390" end="00:10:53.810" style="s2">it fully and completely to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.310" end="00:10:57.100" style="s2">integrity of that you know that thing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.810" end="00:10:57.100" style="s2">the most sacred the most sacrosanct</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:00.570" style="s2">yeah sorry okay what if I&#39;d have been in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.880" end="00:11:03.150" style="s2">a tie right there</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.570" end="00:11:05.520" style="s2">no but there&#39;s this idea that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.150" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">have to divide up the pieces that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.520" end="00:11:12.900" style="s2">have that you can take what you have and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:16.230" style="s2">through voluntary sharing you can you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.900" end="00:11:17.940" style="s2">can&#39;t alleviate the the pressures of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.230" end="00:11:20.370" style="s2">scarce world that you&#39;ve got a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.940" end="00:11:21.240" style="s2">crowd here who&#39;s hungry who&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.370" end="00:11:22.290" style="s2">fed first</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.240" end="00:11:25.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the question you&#39;d immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.290" end="00:11:28.470" style="s2">think is it going to be the apostles or</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.950" end="00:11:30.360" style="s2">is it going to be those who are richest</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.470" end="00:11:31.020" style="s2">in the crowd who have fast passes to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.360" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">Disney World</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.020" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">who&#39;s it going to be and this issue is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:37.860" style="s2">not resolved by saying okay let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:40.860" style="s2">ration out what we have we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.860" end="00:11:43.910" style="s2">basket of fish and loaves somehow in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.860" end="00:11:46.950" style="s2">that moment of voluntary sharing</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.910" end="00:11:48.600" style="s2">scarcity is just overcome it&#39;s just its</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.950" end="00:11:50.910" style="s2">disgust Lee has just thrown out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.600" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">window as if it doesn&#39;t actually bind up</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.910" end="00:11:54.090" style="s2">the universe after all it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:11:56.280" style="s2">powerful stuff in there too does if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.090" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">think about it there&#39;s a moment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.280" end="00:12:02.520" style="s2">a choice and a big part of that choice</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:05.400" style="s2">has to do with fear you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.520" end="00:12:07.590" style="s2">able to choose in the face of fear is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.400" end="00:12:11.330" style="s2">that at that moment there&#39;s a hey who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.590" end="00:12:13.980" style="s2">gonna get the scarce fish and lows and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.330" end="00:12:16.430" style="s2">maybe if I&#39;m probably fear &#39;fl if I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.980" end="00:12:20.370" style="s2">allow fear to be my my basis of choice</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.430" end="00:12:22.020" style="s2">then all I&#39;ll struggle to be the one who</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.370" end="00:12:23.790" style="s2">either a gets it or even better gets to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.020" end="00:12:25.650" style="s2">be the one who makes the determination I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.790" end="00:12:26.910" style="s2">want to be the boss if there&#39;s gonna be</p>
