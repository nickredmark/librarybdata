<p begin="00:00:00.080" end="00:00:04.080" style="s2">i think you might have answered this in</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.320" end="00:00:04.799" style="s2">a way already but i&#39;ll try and make it</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:08.320" style="s2">brief</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.799" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.320" end="00:00:12.160" style="s2">given that it&#39;s um the crisis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">happening and it might be coming in</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">waves</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">um have you already come across any</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">evidence of institutions or governments</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:22.640" style="s2">implementing new ideas that point in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">game b direction um i guess in short is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.640" end="00:00:27.760" style="s2">it all just shenanigans or</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">are there any optimistic signs yet</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.760" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">oh this is nice so check check this out</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;ll show you how i think it works</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">um it&#39;s a bit tricky but when you get</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">you get sensitive to it you&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.360" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">all right so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.640" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">if you&#39;ve ever played that game with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.320" end="00:00:51.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:52.960" style="s2">parachute when you&#39;re a kid you all kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.760" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">of get around and you hold it you pull</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.960" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">it taut and you&#39;re carrying things</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">all right so imagine that and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">structures we&#39;re familiar with right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:03.440" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff heavy stuff on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">on the tarp people are trying to carry</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.440" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">the the but but then imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">there&#39;s a oh</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.240" end="00:01:14.799" style="s2">wait maybe this is even better no i</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2">can&#39;t do that one yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.799" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">um but there&#39;s a different place</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.320" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">like a totally different thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">over to the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">and nobody&#39;s picking it up and nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">carrying it</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got a bunch of folks who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">holding that and they&#39;re carrying it</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">they&#39;re lifting it they&#39;re moving along</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">that&#39;s game a right that&#39;s the world we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">live in and that and that&#39;s the stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">that tarp is the things that is our</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:41.680" style="s2">lives or the things that we&#39;re carrying</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">and um every time somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.680" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">who&#39;s holding on to that tarp looks over</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">and sees this over the thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:49.040" style="s2">and they kind of nudge the person next</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">to him and kind of like hey that thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.040" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">that&#39;s the game b piece and the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">the awakening and the awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">reality of the embeddedness of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">inside the environment who actually have</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">the right capacity and competence</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">now this is happening a whole lot right</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious right shenanigans are</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">the nature of the beast</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">the beast cannot but do shenanigans but</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">the beast at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t a thing right it&#39;s an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">property of a whole lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">collaborating</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">and being willing to give their energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">and intentionality to the maintenance of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">the beast</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">to the degree to which those individuals</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">are beginning to be aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">possibility and the necessity of no</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">longer giving their energies to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">beast and the reality of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">give their energy somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">that proliferation it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">like a hollowing out an ossification and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever seen uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">uh the way a bone looks with the holes</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">the micro micro elements this micro</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">dissolution of the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">coherent coordinating structure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">gives rise to the emergent beast</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">and as the most talented individuals</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">right the people who actually see game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">first from the inside of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">structures almost invariably are</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">unique in some way i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">necessarily unique in a good way but</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">they&#39;re unique in some way</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">they&#39;re sensitive they can feel the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">possibility and they feel the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">the beast and their complicity in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">beast in a uniquely powerful way and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">they try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:26.560" style="s2">how do they continue to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to make it as good as</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.560" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">possible but as they continue to watch</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">what&#39;s happening there are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">find each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">i can&#39;t name a lot of names here but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;s happening very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">truly competent good people skillful</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">smart are beginning to just say you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">what fuck it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">this thing is not working i need to just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">get on the phone and call the guy i went</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">to college with who had to shit together</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">and see what he&#39;s up to and see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">collaborate with him</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">and then i&#39;m going to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">create permission to do it inside the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">thing that i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">which is the way that it always works</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:57.599" style="s2">best anyhow if you&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">inside some shitty corporate environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">you always know the only things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">ever happened when people actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">capacity peer-to-peer inside the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">environment well in this case it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">is happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">super rapidly and across the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">and we actually have a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">people who are incredibly capable</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">and have learned a lot of skills about</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">things like counter insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">and um uh intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">ballgame in the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">so that i think is a way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">it and what we have to do is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">become increasingly conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">mindful</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">of how to because remember we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">to drop the ball in this thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">that thing that that tarp that i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">talking about the thing it&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s our lives and if we let go of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">our lives fall with it and that gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">really bad really fast</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">so we have to actually find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">kind of like get the music to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">and then have the capable hands the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">truly capable hands</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">increasingly steer what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">inside like it&#39;s a fabric that lifts up</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">and weaves itself underneath and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">people are actually held in something</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">and then we begin to move over to this</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">so yes i am seeing some things happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">inside what we would call existing</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">one more piece of theory in here</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">i was talking about with somebody just</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">today and i think it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">i was asking the question of why it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">the dairy diet went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">because i got to tell you dairy dog went</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">wrong and the reason why i went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">i&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">is because when the pipes burst in his</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">apartment</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">he did not fix those pipes himself in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">fact in all likelihood he didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">call the plumber</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">he had to talk to the supervisor</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">supervisor called the plumber the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">plumber fixed the pipes which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">that dairy dog was a first person</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">experience of bode vr simulation</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">the farther you are away from reality</p>

<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">which means you&#39;re going to lose the</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">instead of having to actually be</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">so the people in institutions who happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">to be directly bound to reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">starting to have to figure things out</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">the people who are the furthest away</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">from reality the ones that are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">deepest in the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">confused and or dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">and so we have to figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">decouple their capacity to make choices</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">and or rapidly upgrade their sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">making if they happen to be amenable to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s a long-winded way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">answer your question apologies if it</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very tight</p>
