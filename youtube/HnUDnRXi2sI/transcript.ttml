<p begin="00:01:41.420" end="00:01:45.740" style="s2">run similar to previous situational</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.010" end="00:01:47.900" style="s2">assessments Jordan will spend some time</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.740" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">giving his situational assessment then</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:11.299" style="s2">when you write it down so that&#39;s a brief</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.890" end="00:02:14.180" style="s2">introduction on what is going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.299" end="00:02:20.500" style="s2">today so now I want to pass it off to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.180" end="00:02:20.500" style="s2">Jordan guess what is it live for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.960" end="00:02:30.690" style="s2">and you yeah you&#39;re gonna meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.030" end="00:02:32.340" style="s2">now Jordan thank you I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.690" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">contemplating this and trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.340" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">out what&#39;s a way to well what is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">most salient thing to remote relevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">thing to put into this into this space</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">and the sense that that came to me was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:50.550" style="s2">little bit like folding and the folding</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:52.710" style="s2">of layers of Earth on top of each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.550" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">the crease strata so by the way I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.710" end="00:02:56.960" style="s2">realized in my mind I just activated a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.870" style="s2">little bit of de lawyers up there but um</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.960" end="00:03:03.990" style="s2">but my sense is that that we will not</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.870" end="00:03:07.050" style="s2">meaningfully exit the the liminal moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.990" end="00:03:12.680" style="s2">the at least in the West began with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.050" end="00:03:15.300" style="s2">way the corona virus impacted our system</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.680" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">we are beginning to move through the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.300" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">sort of the psychological adjustment</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:21.390" style="s2">phase where there&#39;s a sense now people</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">having adjusted to a some kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.390" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">state or some kind of new condition and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:29.239" style="s2">of course in that same context that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">adjustment also involves a surfacing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.239" end="00:03:34.050" style="s2">different dispositions in that context</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.070" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">right so we have kind of people also</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.050" end="00:03:40.590" style="s2">pulling apart but they&#39;re pulling apart</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:42.540" style="s2">in this new context and what I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.590" end="00:03:45.959" style="s2">myself noticing is is is looking out</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.540" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">ahead again my horizon is moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">direction of months three four five six</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">months out as opposed to sort of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">right in front of me because it feels</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:55.730" style="s2">like the things right in front while</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:55.730" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.150" end="00:04:00.860" style="s2">are settling there&#39;s a settling</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:04.099" style="s2">happening there so on the one hand III</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.860" end="00:04:06.409" style="s2">do continue to watch the events that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.099" end="00:04:09.019" style="s2">unfolding and I think even I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.409" end="00:04:13.819" style="s2">if it&#39;s not in this venue but relatively</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.019" end="00:04:15.940" style="s2">recently I remember talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.819" end="00:04:19.579" style="s2">thing to be watching now is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:22.100" style="s2">co-creative or the code dynamic forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.579" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">between the balkanization and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.100" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">authoritarianism as they pull back and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:29.090" style="s2">forth against each other I&#39;m so mega</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">like a very simple simple example is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.090" end="00:04:34.910" style="s2">what happened in Orange County with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:37.070" style="s2">beaches so we had a some small loosening</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.910" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">restrictions some small loosening of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.070" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">authoritarianism that unlocked a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:46.010" style="s2">significant energy of people wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:47.599" style="s2">have more well-to-do what something some</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.010" end="00:04:49.610" style="s2">energy that had been constrained about</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.599" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">that authoritarianism which resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.610" end="00:04:51.320" style="s2">a whole lot of people going to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:53.780" style="s2">beaches</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.320" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">what&#39;s then interesting enough generated</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:57.949" style="s2">a pushback like a stronger level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:04:59.599" style="s2">authoritarianism which in this case was</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.949" end="00:05:01.460" style="s2">the governor in California said it okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.599" end="00:05:03.349" style="s2">Orange County beaches are closed again</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.460" end="00:05:06.199" style="s2">but and this is the thing to keep your</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.349" end="00:05:08.539" style="s2">eye on which then led to a pushback with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.199" end="00:05:11.330" style="s2">say County Sheriff saying we now are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.539" end="00:05:14.659" style="s2">going to enforce state law and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:16.340" style="s2">these things move back and forth so one</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.659" end="00:05:17.960" style="s2">of the things I think is very useful to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.340" end="00:05:20.060" style="s2">keep your eye on over the next few</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.960" end="00:05:21.470" style="s2">months is that dynamic at all levels</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:26.090" style="s2">like all the fractal levels even in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.470" end="00:05:28.760" style="s2">own mind but I I found my attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.090" end="00:05:30.110" style="s2">pulling forward if I look for where big</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.760" end="00:05:31.610" style="s2">waves are coming in particularly where</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.110" end="00:05:34.550" style="s2">waves are beginning to we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.610" end="00:05:37.220" style="s2">reinforcing each other late summer and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:39.979" style="s2">early fall seems like a place to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.220" end="00:05:43.639" style="s2">focusing enormous attention right now we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.979" end="00:05:45.319" style="s2">have at least three distinct</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.639" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">vectors through distinct ways like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.319" end="00:05:51.770" style="s2">desert in some sense independent but are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:54.349" style="s2">also very meaningfully overlap so we of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.770" end="00:05:56.740" style="s2">course have the the concern or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.349" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">inquiry or the question about a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.740" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">quote-unquote second way in the end of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:03.349" style="s2">viral direction and whether that second</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.000" style="s2">wave comes from one of nine different</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.349" end="00:06:06.860" style="s2">directions and other ones at least nine</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.000" end="00:06:08.180" style="s2">different ways that could show up the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.860" end="00:06:12.889" style="s2">key inside is the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:17.030" style="s2">would see a resurgence or a surge in</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.889" end="00:06:19.250" style="s2">cases potentially more more lethal cases</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.030" end="00:06:21.020" style="s2">that would then shift consciousness away</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.250" end="00:06:22.699" style="s2">from a okay this thing is over let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.020" end="00:06:25.250" style="s2">relax and settle back into something on</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.699" end="00:06:26.750" style="s2">the other side of virus space into a Oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.250" end="00:06:30.110" style="s2">what do we do with this how do we deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.750" end="00:06:32.379" style="s2">with it and how do we respond so when</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.110" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">the zero to one shifts in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.379" end="00:06:38.990" style="s2">at the same time with a both or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:40.969" style="s2">bordering uncertainty the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.990" end="00:06:43.699" style="s2">implications of the perturbation at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.969" end="00:06:45.819" style="s2">economy level will be cascading through</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.699" end="00:06:48.139" style="s2">in that timeframe so these things have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.819" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">was it a general thing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.139" end="00:06:53.870" style="s2">watching very closely said something</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:56.150" style="s2">like modern economies can stop like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.870" end="00:06:58.490" style="s2">sports car but they restart like a train</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.150" end="00:07:00.710" style="s2">actually there&#39;s a this thing stopped</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.490" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">watching the implications of all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.710" end="00:07:04.879" style="s2">different supply chain disruptions from</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:06.250" style="s2">the demand side than by the supply side</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.879" end="00:07:08.389" style="s2">and then back on the demand side</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.250" end="00:07:09.979" style="s2">financial side stimulus side</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.389" end="00:07:12.409" style="s2">unemployment like all these different</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.979" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">interventions there&#39;s a series of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.409" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">ripples that are cascading through very</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.169" style="s2">large number of different systems and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.740" end="00:07:22.370" style="s2">those will continue to play out and play</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.169" end="00:07:24.889" style="s2">out and play out and kind of the thud of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.370" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">that won&#39;t really be felt until late</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.889" end="00:07:28.940" style="s2">summer so when you get into late summer</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:30.889" style="s2">early fall well-formed sort of finally</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.940" end="00:07:32.839" style="s2">at last be getting some sense of what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.889" end="00:07:34.069" style="s2">did with with the implications of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.839" end="00:07:37.490" style="s2">choices we made last month actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.069" end="00:07:38.659" style="s2">unlikely to be so you&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.490" end="00:07:40.129" style="s2">yourself where we may very well find</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.659" end="00:07:43.310" style="s2">ourselves in a circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.129" end="00:07:44.659" style="s2">there&#39;s a gosh I thought the viruses in</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.310" end="00:07:46.849" style="s2">the review mirror even though we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.659" end="00:07:48.379" style="s2">aware of the story of second wave it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.849" end="00:07:50.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter embodied sense of it will</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.379" end="00:07:53.479" style="s2">be we&#39;re past it when in fact it may</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.990" end="00:07:56.599" style="s2">actually come back into a desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.479" end="00:07:57.529" style="s2">perceived as more salient while now the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.599" end="00:07:59.329" style="s2">impact</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.529" end="00:08:01.159" style="s2">implications that actually settled into</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.329" end="00:08:02.659" style="s2">something which is now felt deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.159" end="00:08:04.729" style="s2">across a lot of different strata so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.659" end="00:08:06.529" style="s2">those two those two waves could very</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.729" end="00:08:09.769" style="s2">easily become highly reinforcing a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.529" end="00:08:11.719" style="s2">simple example might be a okay now we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.769" end="00:08:14.089" style="s2">need to go back into lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.719" end="00:08:15.409" style="s2">but now a stronger a very strong sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.089" end="00:08:17.899" style="s2">that fuck you I&#39;m not going to lock down</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.409" end="00:08:19.159" style="s2">what exactly happens there and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.899" end="00:08:22.429" style="s2">tension between those two of course is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.159" end="00:08:23.689" style="s2">perfectly aligned to build but of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.429" end="00:08:25.609" style="s2">at least in the context of the United</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.689" end="00:08:28.819" style="s2">States then you also have the political</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.609" end="00:08:31.459" style="s2">side specifically the election so in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.819" end="00:08:35.300" style="s2">late summer early fall we&#39;ll be entering</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.459" end="00:08:37.149" style="s2">into a principle provisionally a formal</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.300" end="00:08:40.669" style="s2">choice of who the Democratic nominee is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.149" end="00:08:43.159" style="s2">and a the game is afoot in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.669" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">the election will look like and so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.159" end="00:08:48.079" style="s2">would imagine that the energy underneath</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:50.089" style="s2">that curve will be will be higher like</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.079" end="00:08:52.339" style="s2">step function higher than it is now and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.089" end="00:08:54.889" style="s2">build it like accelerating towards the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.339" end="00:08:58.370" style="s2">fever pitch and where we&#39;ll be in late</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.889" end="00:08:59.749" style="s2">October so then that&#39;s another one right</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.370" end="00:09:01.459" style="s2">and of course the implications of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.749" end="00:09:04.459" style="s2">choice making around economy and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.459" end="00:09:07.160" style="s2">choice making around virus shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.459" end="00:09:09.740" style="s2">the context of election and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.160" end="00:09:13.510" style="s2">and of course in the context of election</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.740" end="00:09:15.910" style="s2">the moment how I say it be it</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.510" end="00:09:18.700" style="s2">patient to play political games to gain</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.910" end="00:09:21.610" style="s2">political capital by trading on fear and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.700" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">or real implications in virus space and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.610" end="00:09:25.810" style="s2">economic space will be inescapable and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:27.340" style="s2">then we can I guess finally layer on</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.810" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">something that&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.340" end="00:09:32.130" style="s2">difficult to track because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:35.410" style="s2">trajectory most of the trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.130" end="00:09:37.390" style="s2">invisible or difficult to see and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.410" end="00:09:38.830" style="s2">way that evolves is equally difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.390" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">trace that&#39;s it the geopolitical level</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.830" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">so I imagined that most people now are</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:54.010" style="s2">aware of the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:56.530" style="s2">origin narrative this has gone from by</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.010" end="00:09:59.580" style="s2">the way it originally showed up in China</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.530" end="00:10:02.230" style="s2">so shortly after the the virus was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.580" end="00:10:03.550" style="s2">became known in China so as it went from</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.230" end="00:10:04.990" style="s2">being the thing that was happened do the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.550" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">thing that was being perceived</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.990" end="00:10:10.540" style="s2">there was actually explosion in Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.180" end="00:10:14.710" style="s2">social media with the this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.540" end="00:10:18.070" style="s2">human-made virus narrative which got</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.710" end="00:10:19.540" style="s2">shut down like clipped one night so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.070" end="00:10:21.940" style="s2">search was going like this and the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.540" end="00:10:23.590" style="s2">night he was effectively gone and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.940" end="00:10:24.910" style="s2">and it was relatively silent that can</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.590" end="00:10:29.470" style="s2">burst through in a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.910" end="00:10:30.970" style="s2">small areas mostly futurists types were</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.470" end="00:10:33.450" style="s2">head connections to China who are aware</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.970" end="00:10:35.470" style="s2">of the previous narrative in research</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.450" end="00:10:37.740" style="s2">its kind of trace that it went</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.470" end="00:10:39.970" style="s2">underground up until gosh I guess about</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.740" end="00:10:41.290" style="s2">couple weeks ago and now it&#39;s beginning</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.970" end="00:10:42.940" style="s2">to burst back into the mainstream in now</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.290" end="00:10:44.170" style="s2">in fact not just bursting into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.940" end="00:10:45.340" style="s2">mainstream of consciousness but now</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.170" end="00:10:49.890" style="s2">becoming part of the geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.340" end="00:10:53.470" style="s2">fencing match and so the dynamic between</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.890" end="00:10:56.170" style="s2">the West the Trump administration in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.470" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">particular and China which is not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.170" end="00:11:01.870" style="s2">whole thing a China&#39;s a whole complex of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:03.700" style="s2">different groups and forces it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:05.950" style="s2">likely to continue to escalate as we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.700" end="00:11:07.660" style="s2">move into the summer and fall but much</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.950" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">more complex but at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.660" end="00:11:13.450" style="s2">could add to this wave spicy could have</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">a fourth wave that builds in that exact</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.450" end="00:11:18.220" style="s2">same time frame so I think that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:19.830" style="s2">of a good place to stop it&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.220" end="00:11:25.110" style="s2">very general but in terms of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.830" end="00:11:26.270" style="s2">the feeling I have is a feeling of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.110" end="00:11:28.070" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.270" end="00:11:30.440" style="s2">a certain class of rollercoaster where</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.070" end="00:11:32.270" style="s2">you go up and you do a big dive but</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.440" end="00:11:34.460" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not the real dive like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.270" end="00:11:36.470" style="s2">you feel your stomach come up into your</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.460" end="00:11:38.990" style="s2">throat but then you get the real big one</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.470" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">I get the feeling that&#39;s gonna kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.990" end="00:11:44.180" style="s2">be like that and that that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:46.070" style="s2">layers of like you know there&#39;s an info</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.180" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">leanness that we were in a liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.070" end="00:11:49.490" style="s2">and we&#39;re almost coming to terms at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:50.360" style="s2">liminal set but before we can even and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.490" end="00:11:52.400" style="s2">by the way I wouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.360" end="00:11:54.410" style="s2">recommend that we try to exit liminal</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.400" end="00:11:57.190" style="s2">space but before we can come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.410" end="00:11:59.870" style="s2">with it there&#39;s actually infolding</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.190" end="00:12:02.690" style="s2">another layer that comes on top and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.870" end="00:12:06.830" style="s2">actually builds a strata of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.690" end="00:12:09.830" style="s2">at and to the extent possible it would</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.830" end="00:12:12.760" style="s2">be by my sense at least that to be able</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.830" end="00:12:15.950" style="s2">to orient to that pace or into that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.760" end="00:12:22.310" style="s2">dynamic and build the skillfulness of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.950" end="00:12:24.680" style="s2">agency sovereignty in that context and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.310" end="00:12:26.570" style="s2">meta I mean not as just as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.680" end="00:12:28.390" style="s2">book like this but groups of people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.570" end="00:12:31.640" style="s2">are beginning to orient and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.390" end="00:12:35.260" style="s2">cohere around the recognition that it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.640" end="00:12:41.000" style="s2">only in creating relationality</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.260" end="00:12:42.980" style="s2">discernment integrity sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.000" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">then increasingly collaborative fective</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.980" end="00:12:49.310" style="s2">collaborative choice making that we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:52.940" style="s2">begin to form a ship that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.310" end="00:12:56.579" style="s2">sail is increasingly choppy seas okay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.940" end="00:13:00.040" style="s2">I suppose that&#39;s that for now</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.579" end="00:13:03.459" style="s2">all right Jordan thank you for setting</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.040" end="00:13:06.130" style="s2">the background there&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.459" end="00:13:08.829" style="s2">people who came in so I might reiterate</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.130" end="00:13:12.010" style="s2">the instructions again we have like 79</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.829" end="00:13:13.779" style="s2">people here so if you have a question</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.620" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">your question if you want me to read</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.440" end="00:13:25.930" style="s2">your question just indicate and I will</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">read it out aloud for you</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:41.410" style="s2">you know that I think I&#39;ll start this in</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.240" end="00:13:42.820" style="s2">asking a question around like the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.410" end="00:13:46.779" style="s2">thing that came out to my mind is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.820" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">oh I wasn&#39;t seeing oh this potential for</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.779" end="00:13:53.110" style="s2">different ways coming at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:55.540" style="s2">is there a good way to I guess prepare</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.110" end="00:13:58.290" style="s2">for that or watch out for that to see if</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.540" end="00:13:58.290" style="s2">it&#39;s actually coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.860" end="00:14:08.910" style="s2">because the the way you ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.540" end="00:14:11.880" style="s2">it shifted for me so the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.910" end="00:14:15.150" style="s2">the question felt like he was a how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.880" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">you had to prepare for it how do you the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.150" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">wave is coming and how do you prepare</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.780" style="s2">yourself so when the wave hits you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:22.980" style="s2">not thrown over and then the second was</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.780" end="00:14:24.900" style="s2">shifted in the direction of more in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.980" end="00:14:28.520" style="s2">rest of sense making how do we have we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.900" end="00:14:28.520" style="s2">become capable of perceiving it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.709" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">in the context of perceiving it and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.119" end="00:14:39.540" style="s2">medicine is sort of the same medicine</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about for quite some</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.540" end="00:14:44.430" style="s2">time which is just to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.550" end="00:14:47.249" style="s2">cultivate your since making Network a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.430" end="00:14:48.899" style="s2">very simple approach which we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.249" end="00:14:52.559" style="s2">available to us right now would be to go</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.899" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">back and try to identify the the nodes</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.559" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">of the individuals and in that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:15:01.699" style="s2">individuals but actually our collections</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:05.579" style="s2">of individuals that did the best job in</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.699" end="00:15:06.809" style="s2">january/february and and have continued</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.579" end="00:15:08.550" style="s2">to maintain qualities you could just</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.809" end="00:15:11.699" style="s2">kind of go back and do an audit and find</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.550" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">individuals who really seemed to had</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.699" end="00:15:16.139" style="s2">high quality perception and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.980" end="00:15:19.050" style="s2">integrity of their communication through</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.139" end="00:15:20.339" style="s2">that arc and you know gathered them just</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.050" end="00:15:21.689" style="s2">write them down what I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.339" end="00:15:23.899" style="s2">spreadsheet or something keep an eye on</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.689" end="00:15:23.899" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:30.199" style="s2">by the way and this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.360" end="00:15:32.500" style="s2">technique that I use quite often the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.199" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">exact inverse is also quite useful so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.500" end="00:15:39.050" style="s2">you think oh ok for example I think I</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:42.250" style="s2">even mentioned this in a facebook thread</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.050" end="00:15:44.420" style="s2">whenever I see the word debunked I</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.250" end="00:15:47.209" style="s2">assume that it means exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.420" end="00:15:48.589" style="s2">opposite which it means pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.209" end="00:15:50.329" style="s2">the thing that is being claimed to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.589" end="00:15:51.800" style="s2">debunked it doesn&#39;t mean that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.329" end="00:15:53.810" style="s2">that is claimed to be debunked is true</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.800" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">but it means it is pay attention here</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.810" end="00:15:58.759" style="s2">like dig here a little bit more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:16:01.160" style="s2">because somebody somewhere and maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.759" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">consciously really doesn&#39;t want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">attention to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:06.139" style="s2">so there&#39;s circumstances also where</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:07.910" style="s2">there was there are sources of sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.139" end="00:16:12.370" style="s2">making it mostly these are no sources of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.910" end="00:16:14.569" style="s2">news that are so obviously bad signal I</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.370" end="00:16:15.620" style="s2">said this but not just noise though</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.569" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">they&#39;re actually extremely high quality</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.620" end="00:16:20.690" style="s2">signal in the inverse direction so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">was also useful like have that and where</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.690" end="00:16:26.209" style="s2">you see that almost clumsy effort to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:28.730" style="s2">steer your attention you can also use</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.209" end="00:16:31.910" style="s2">that as signal so ok cool I&#39;ve seen I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.730" end="00:16:34.760" style="s2">seeing the signs of desires or efforts</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.910" end="00:16:37.490" style="s2">to in the war on sense making to control</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.760" end="00:16:40.519" style="s2">the narrative to bind my mind to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.490" end="00:16:42.470" style="s2">particular frame ok great I now have</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.519" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">enough capacity to actually use that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.470" end="00:16:46.310" style="s2">a counter signal and that Orient&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.199" style="s2">more effective like I&#39;m sort of able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.310" end="00:16:50.269" style="s2">parkour off the wall and bounce back</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.199" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">into the direction so I think both these</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.269" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">are quite true and then you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:59.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a the the basic would you call it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">like cross-training you know tune into</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.180" end="00:17:04.220" style="s2">yourself check in with your body see</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">where your own narratives pop up the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.220" end="00:17:09.589" style="s2">that you delude yourself the way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:10.699" style="s2">you avoid certain things and continue to</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.589" end="00:17:12.770" style="s2">kind of build that because over the next</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.699" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">couple of months we do in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.770" end="00:17:16.689" style="s2">have a slowing down I would propose or</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:20.259" style="s2">at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.689" end="00:17:21.759" style="s2">I expect so this is a good opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.259" end="00:17:24.459" style="s2">to actually take some deep breaths and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.759" end="00:17:26.679" style="s2">kind of rebuild out those capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.459" end="00:17:30.879" style="s2">retune your since they can environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.679" end="00:17:34.149" style="s2">it&#39;s a at the individual level in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.879" end="00:17:36.669" style="s2">of preparation actually being prepared I</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.149" end="00:17:39.549" style="s2">would actually take the more aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.669" end="00:17:41.559" style="s2">approach this is an energy this is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.549" end="00:17:43.210" style="s2">wave of energy that&#39;s coming through and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.559" end="00:17:45.669" style="s2">what would be ideal is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.210" end="00:17:48.190" style="s2">create turn yourself into a sprint</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.669" end="00:17:49.480" style="s2">turn yourself into an engine that can</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.190" end="00:17:51.460" style="s2">find a way it can convert that energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.480" end="00:17:53.740" style="s2">into something that then directs back</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.460" end="00:17:57.309" style="s2">out in a way that creates the change you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.740" end="00:17:58.120" style="s2">want to see in the world what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.309" end="00:18:01.779" style="s2">that looks like this certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.120" end="00:18:03.700" style="s2">non-trivial but again you can always use</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.779" end="00:18:05.590" style="s2">the basic rule there something of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.700" end="00:18:06.460" style="s2">that shows up in yourself and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.590" end="00:18:08.559" style="s2">there&#39;s something that shows up in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.460" end="00:18:14.039" style="s2">relationships as that becomes a larger</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:18.190" style="s2">fractal so practicing teamwork and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.039" end="00:18:20.950" style="s2">learning how to actually produce results</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.190" end="00:18:21.779" style="s2">and by the way thinking about how do I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.950" end="00:18:24.309" style="s2">say this</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.779" end="00:18:26.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an inhibition on</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.309" end="00:18:28.330" style="s2">change and an additional possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.350" end="00:18:30.429" style="s2">that shows up in our own sensibility of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.330" end="00:18:33.759" style="s2">what is in fact actually possible most</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.429" end="00:18:37.000" style="s2">of the time almost time oftentimes we</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.759" end="00:18:39.490" style="s2">limit what could happen ourselves like</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.000" end="00:18:44.470" style="s2">we preempt change by inhibiting our own</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.490" end="00:18:45.789" style="s2">willingness to try and by the way in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.470" end="00:18:47.590" style="s2">many cases that&#39;s actually perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.789" end="00:18:49.899" style="s2">reasonable that&#39;s actually a very good</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.590" end="00:18:51.059" style="s2">choice most of the time carefulness is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.899" end="00:18:54.700" style="s2">the right response</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.059" end="00:18:57.759" style="s2">but sometimes boldness is the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.700" end="00:18:59.940" style="s2">response and so sort of practicing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.759" end="00:19:03.190" style="s2">boldness might be a very useful skill</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.940" end="00:19:06.070" style="s2">you know rock climbing or whitewater</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.190" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">rafting or is it just metaphors but or</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.070" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">in fact actually practical but</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:14.289" style="s2">practicing the fine art of learning how</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">and when to move into a it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.289" end="00:19:19.419" style="s2">attack it&#39;s time to make bold moves into</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:21.419" style="s2">possibility and feel that that energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.419" end="00:19:26.289" style="s2">feels like you this Chronos Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.419" end="00:19:26.840" style="s2">distinction capoeira yeah if you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.289" end="00:19:29.750" style="s2">access to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.840" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">capoeira domain that might be a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.750" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">good skill like practice learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">move from the dance that is the dance to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.850" style="s2">the music to the dance that has suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:39.830" style="s2">morphed into kicking somebody&#39;s ass or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.850" end="00:19:45.430" style="s2">whole group of people has asked still to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.830" end="00:19:45.430" style="s2">the music but all very metaphorical by</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:49.480" style="s2">I think that&#39;s probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.889" end="00:19:50.950" style="s2">fundamentally the most globally true</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.480" end="00:19:56.830" style="s2">piece we can get into details if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.950" end="00:19:58.450" style="s2">like appreciate that answer many great</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.830" end="00:19:59.980" style="s2">questions coming in the chat so thanks</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.450" end="00:20:02.200" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.980" end="00:20:06.010" style="s2">what&#39;s calling to me is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.200" end="00:20:06.760" style="s2">Brad the blinds can you unmute and ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.010" end="00:20:12.100" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.760" end="00:20:13.750" style="s2">I can hear me all right great so Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.100" end="00:20:16.659" style="s2">thanks for doing this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.750" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">my question was mainly around the game</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.659" end="00:20:23.049" style="s2">be seen I see a lot around group</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:26.380" style="s2">coherence and sense-making which is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.049" end="00:20:28.120" style="s2">much needed but I&#39;m finding as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.380" end="00:20:30.309" style="s2">trying to self-organize there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.120" end="00:20:32.950" style="s2">little work or discussion about group</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.309" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">cohesion meaning the ability for a group</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.950" end="00:20:36.669" style="s2">to stick together so once more about</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.570" end="00:21:15.450" style="s2">would suggest is that the generally</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.899" end="00:21:17.799" style="s2">speaking the answer to cohesion is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.450" end="00:21:21.929" style="s2">embodied complexity which generally</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.799" end="00:21:21.929" style="s2">speaking means actually do something so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.830" end="00:21:28.570" style="s2">for example if you&#39;ve ever done like an</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.180" end="00:21:30.340" style="s2">outward-bound project program you can</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.940" end="00:21:39.160" style="s2">other side of the wall and build a raft</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.170" end="00:21:41.340" style="s2">and cross the river</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.160" end="00:21:43.300" style="s2">you know actually solve real problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.340" end="00:21:45.730" style="s2">what&#39;s amazing is that that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.330" end="00:21:53.800" style="s2">like these micro it&#39;s it&#39;s the the</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.400" end="00:22:03.190" style="s2">looking at you I may actually be looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.260" end="00:22:06.760" style="s2">off into the corner so so to build</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.190" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">cohesion requires to actually undergo</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.760" end="00:22:13.300" style="s2">something in reality together and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:16.810" style="s2">more embodied it is the actual the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.300" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">better so the old day raised bed garden</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.810" end="00:22:21.100" style="s2">together write software together that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:24.520" style="s2">has a closed-loop mean that it actually</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.520" end="00:22:28.510" style="s2">point where the world actually verifies</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.140" end="00:22:30.070" style="s2">that you did a good job those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.510" end="00:22:32.020" style="s2">practices write a document together</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:33.970" style="s2">where you&#39;re delivering that document</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.020" end="00:22:37.630" style="s2">out into reality you know the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.970" end="00:22:40.060" style="s2">little loop the a loops back to the oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">right but it loops out of the entity the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.060" end="00:22:45.430" style="s2">entity is the OOD a reality is the ADA</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:48.250" style="s2">oh and that&#39;s that that linkage right</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.430" end="00:22:50.860" style="s2">there so the practices of cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.250" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">building are always have to be embodied</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.860" end="00:22:57.100" style="s2">practices in direct relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:59.830" style="s2">reality iteratively like just do them in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.100" end="00:23:01.540" style="s2">amps the stakes I can build increase the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.830" end="00:23:04.900" style="s2">stakes and as you increase the stakes</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.540" end="00:23:06.310" style="s2">and the most cohesive groups are like</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.900" end="00:23:07.960" style="s2">the Navy SEALs and how do they do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.310" end="00:23:09.610" style="s2">they go through buds train ignites the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.960" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">stakes are very very high and very</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.610" end="00:23:16.750" style="s2">intense and though what they generally</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:18.610" style="s2">do isn&#39;t meaningful and carrying a log</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.750" end="00:23:21.700" style="s2">through the mud or getting on a boat and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.610" end="00:23:23.590" style="s2">you know as the waves are crashing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.700" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">meaningful but the the reality is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.590" end="00:23:28.600" style="s2">to practice against reality to practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">against nature such that the group has</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.600" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">to discover its embodied capacity as</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:35.830" style="s2">humans to learn how to trust and how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:36.620" style="s2">build the strength of the binding</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.830" end="00:23:38.300" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.450" end="00:24:06.090" style="s2">yourself and ask your question sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.499" end="00:24:08.850" style="s2">hello Jordan can&#39;t see you so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.090" end="00:24:11.429" style="s2">your sense with what&#39;s going on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.850" end="00:24:14.369" style="s2">spiritual layout since you spoke on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.429" end="00:24:16.200" style="s2">stoah about a spiritual crisis and also</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.369" end="00:24:17.519" style="s2">as you&#39;re talking and sensing that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.200" end="00:24:23.389" style="s2">answer is gonna be something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.519" end="00:24:23.389" style="s2">a kind of listening leave it at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.910" end="00:24:46.800" style="s2">what I do notice as I expected would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:53.390" style="s2">the case that more people are losing</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.800" end="00:24:53.390" style="s2">their minds more fully and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.070" end="00:25:00.610" style="s2">that would be I think probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.590" end="00:25:02.820" style="s2">most meaningful or most uh I say this</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.610" end="00:25:02.820" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.500" end="00:25:07.750" style="s2">it is simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.380" end="00:25:11.050" style="s2">most obvious but also more suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.750" end="00:25:13.420" style="s2">most relevant aspect of that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.050" end="00:25:14.770" style="s2">the spiritual crisis like even the term</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.420" end="00:25:16.210" style="s2">spiritual crisis is a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.770" end="00:25:19.530" style="s2">describing a psychotic break isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.210" end="00:25:19.530" style="s2">really would good with thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:25.450" style="s2">gosh it&#39;s such a weird actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.740" end="00:25:28.740" style="s2">feeling a certain pressure which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.450" end="00:25:28.740" style="s2">interesting like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.670" end="00:25:33.480" style="s2">sense is that there&#39;s a seeking or a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.530" end="00:25:37.860" style="s2">looking or an effort to discover</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.480" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">something that is normally not seeable</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.860" end="00:25:42.810" style="s2">something that is normally quite good at</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:47.180" style="s2">hiding itself from our view but</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.810" end="00:25:49.530" style="s2">nonetheless plays a decisive role in in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.180" end="00:25:52.260" style="s2">influencing our choice making what just</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.530" end="00:25:54.420" style="s2">popped into my head is a really nice</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.260" end="00:25:55.860" style="s2">yeah when is it the veil is very thin</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.420" end="00:25:57.060" style="s2">right now that&#39;s a nice way of putting</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.060" end="00:26:05.160" style="s2">and in fact I think that the physicality</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.940" end="00:26:06.780" style="s2">of it is actually quite Neal I was just</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.160" end="00:26:10.260" style="s2">reading an article that Jim Wright will</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.300" end="00:27:13.920" style="s2">the thing that I love that with which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.920" end="00:27:16.710" style="s2">that there was a at the objective level</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.840" end="00:27:23.790" style="s2">that&#39;s shaking things up is it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.430" end="00:27:25.950" style="s2">like a pain and echolocation in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.790" end="00:27:28.290" style="s2">spiritual realm of the psycho spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.950" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">realm and if you slow down and listen</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.290" end="00:27:33.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that as the echoes are</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:36.600" style="s2">bouncing off of everything and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.510" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">the the illusion of normality is so</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.269" end="00:27:55.690" style="s2">and this will tend to give rise to more</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.059" end="00:27:57.609" style="s2">more basic energies so erotic energy for</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.690" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">example will tend to show up more</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.609" end="00:28:05.289" style="s2">powerfully because it&#39;s more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:07.749" style="s2">but it says it&#39;s more founded in longer</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.289" end="00:28:10.179" style="s2">deeper things and so you should expect</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.179" end="00:28:13.629" style="s2">and then shifting in and controlling</p>

<p begin="00:28:13.629" end="00:28:16.690" style="s2">actually a very interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.679" end="00:28:20.259" style="s2">think about and a to degree to which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.690" end="00:28:21.879" style="s2">want to become agents in this story true</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.259" end="00:28:24.669" style="s2">the degree to which we can taste that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.879" end="00:28:26.409" style="s2">the building or fundamental energy and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.669" end="00:28:28.809" style="s2">ourselves and understand where it wants</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.409" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">to go and become vehicles for its</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.809" end="00:28:32.440" style="s2">flowing into the world we can up</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.700" end="00:28:35.669" style="s2">regulate it and allow it to express</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.440" end="00:28:35.669" style="s2">itself which minute of course the BR</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:43.050" style="s2">mmm you may have already answered this</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.490" end="00:28:47.550" style="s2">Jordan but I&#39;m thinking about pushing</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.050" end="00:28:57.960" style="s2">into some positive like Kim&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.550" end="00:29:03.900" style="s2">yourself yeah I do Orden you just went</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.960" end="00:29:06.780" style="s2">blank I&#39;m just gonna assume that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.900" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">still there you&#39;ll see I can&#39;t see you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.780" end="00:29:13.740" style="s2">yeah I can see you on the side right my</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:15.480" style="s2">question is kind of long the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.740" end="00:29:19.320" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing you ain&#39;t talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.480" end="00:29:21.570" style="s2">about us moving the it feels like in</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.320" end="00:29:24.500" style="s2">this sort of build-up and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.570" end="00:29:28.590" style="s2">shaking shaking the web and it going out</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.500" end="00:29:31.050" style="s2">further us getting a little freedom in</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.590" end="00:29:32.910" style="s2">the summer us getting then then shaking</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.050" end="00:29:34.890" style="s2">up again and then the election coming at</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.910" end="00:29:38.760" style="s2">the business of time it&#39;s like a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.890" end="00:29:41.400" style="s2">specific and special time that we can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.760" end="00:29:46.440" style="s2">paying attention to and what are there</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.400" end="00:29:49.140" style="s2">ways we can maximize this period yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">just just to just do the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.140" end="00:29:54.510" style="s2">advantage of the greatest good thank you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:55.860" style="s2">yeah thank you uh the thing that popped</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.510" end="00:29:56.850" style="s2">into my head and I think I really like</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.860" end="00:29:57.540" style="s2">the way that you used a particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.850" end="00:29:58.680" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.540" end="00:30:00.780" style="s2">it&#39;s the way that you said it for me was</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.680" end="00:30:02.820" style="s2">this inertia shaking the web the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.780" end="00:30:04.890" style="s2">a spider at the center of a web and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.820" end="00:30:07.710" style="s2">things hitting it and shaking it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.890" end="00:30:08.730" style="s2">kind of coming through our feet the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.710" end="00:30:10.350" style="s2">thing that popped in my head was just</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:11.640" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that was linearly related</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.350" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">to what you were saying but it feels</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.640" end="00:30:16.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s very important is to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:20.010" style="s2">look here&#39;s the reality every</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.500" end="00:30:22.020" style="s2">institution is made up I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.010" end="00:30:24.060" style="s2">super important about the game a game B</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.020" end="00:30:26.940" style="s2">language was invented to present into</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.060" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">consciousness the reality that other</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.940" end="00:30:33.210" style="s2">than those things that are strictly</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:35.610" style="s2">natural like biological in nature or</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.210" end="00:30:38.190" style="s2">physics everything else is a game that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.610" end="00:30:39.390" style="s2">we made up we&#39;re playing the money game</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.190" end="00:30:42.210" style="s2">we&#39;re putting the government game we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.390" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">playing the how we live in family game</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.210" end="00:30:49.590" style="s2">like all that stuff and it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.990" style="s2">notice that there ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.590" end="00:30:54.120" style="s2">buddy in charge and it&#39;s okay to realize</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.990" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">that there are no adults in the room I</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.120" end="00:30:56.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve spent time</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.169" end="00:30:58.409" style="s2">interacting with the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.580" end="00:31:01.289" style="s2">officially leaders they really aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.409" end="00:31:02.970" style="s2">any more mature wise or sophisticated or</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.289" end="00:31:04.710" style="s2">capable than strategic or intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.970" end="00:31:06.419" style="s2">than anybody else you&#39;ve ever met</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.710" end="00:31:07.650" style="s2">on occasion there&#39;s a few folks out</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.419" end="00:31:10.710" style="s2">there there&#39;s obviously the average</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:12.179" style="s2">variance but pick a group of 180 people</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.710" end="00:31:14.460" style="s2">who kind of gather together you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.179" end="00:31:16.740" style="s2">pretty sizable slice of the whole human</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.460" end="00:31:18.510" style="s2">population broadly speaking on these in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.740" end="00:31:21.950" style="s2">terms of competence not necessarily in</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.510" end="00:31:24.590" style="s2">terms of perspective or background and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.950" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">that&#39;s not that it&#39;s not grounds for</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.590" end="00:31:31.770" style="s2">concern this I think is the point is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:34.440" style="s2">is grounds for responsibility okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.770" end="00:31:37.350" style="s2">playing a game the game sucks and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.440" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">gets it&#39;s getting worse right it was it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.350" end="00:31:41.940" style="s2">has all kinds of negative constraints in</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:45.210" style="s2">particular produces people in a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:46.649" style="s2">unfortunate way but now we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.210" end="00:31:47.970" style="s2">see that it&#39;s also not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.649" end="00:31:50.340" style="s2">effective at doing the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.970" end="00:31:53.070" style="s2">supposed to do like managing simple</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.340" end="00:31:54.630" style="s2">things like making sure masks are</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.070" end="00:31:56.070" style="s2">produced and delivered to places like</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.630" end="00:31:58.049" style="s2">even if the thing it&#39;s it claims to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.070" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">well which is material economics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.049" end="00:32:00.779" style="s2">beginning to have real challenges okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:03.539" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.779" end="00:32:04.760" style="s2">why don&#39;t we design a new game and here</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.539" end="00:32:07.890" style="s2">what I would do is I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.760" end="00:32:10.409" style="s2">insert the framework and the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.890" end="00:32:12.299" style="s2">that I put out ever so long ago we</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.409" end="00:32:15.240" style="s2">should say look there&#39;s kind of three</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.299" end="00:32:19.460" style="s2">layers and they&#39;re very distant almost</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.240" end="00:32:22.620" style="s2">like temperature layers in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.460" end="00:32:25.049" style="s2">there&#39;s the game be story but the gaming</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.620" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">story is not yet right here like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.049" end="00:32:27.809" style="s2">expect at least I may be wrong but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.610" end="00:32:31.649" style="s2">don&#39;t expect that we can just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.809" end="00:32:33.720" style="s2">teleport to game B teleportation is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.649" end="00:32:36.659" style="s2">awesome but I think it mostly just lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.720" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">in Star Trek we have to journey to game</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.659" end="00:32:40.710" style="s2">B so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:45.240" style="s2">journey and there&#39;s a transition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.710" end="00:32:48.630" style="s2">that transition B is crucial and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.240" end="00:32:51.090" style="s2">transition B will inevitably look the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.630" end="00:32:53.190" style="s2">first step we&#39;ll have two really</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">interesting characteristics one</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.190" end="00:32:58.169" style="s2">characteristic is that will look a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:33:00.899" style="s2">like where we are so in many ways it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.169" end="00:33:03.450" style="s2">will look like a it would be India Jason</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.899" end="00:33:05.429" style="s2">possible so a it will be possible and B</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.450" end="00:33:07.230" style="s2">be adjacent nice wouldn&#39;t be a step and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.429" end="00:33:09.480" style="s2">you can look around and say okay things</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.230" end="00:33:11.659" style="s2">haven&#39;t changed that much on the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.480" end="00:33:15.240" style="s2">hand things will have changed completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.659" end="00:33:19.070" style="s2">the metaphor that I really liked is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.240" end="00:33:22.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a this this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.070" end="00:33:24.539" style="s2">parting of the Red Sea and leaving Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.139" end="00:33:27.299" style="s2">moment this is not a arriving in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.539" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">promised land moment and the thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.299" end="00:33:32.700" style="s2">that as the Red Sea is parting you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:34.740" style="s2">still in Egypt and as even as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.700" end="00:33:35.940" style="s2">going across the Red Sea Egypt&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.740" end="00:33:38.490" style="s2">right over there you look over your</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.940" end="00:33:41.250" style="s2">shoulder you can still see Egypt but at</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.490" end="00:33:43.110" style="s2">the same time you&#39;ve left Egypt that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.250" end="00:33:44.730" style="s2">those are very very important like to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.110" end="00:33:45.659" style="s2">recognize that distinction and if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.730" end="00:33:47.610" style="s2">think about that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.659" end="00:33:50.700" style="s2">practicality if we&#39;re designing a new</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.610" end="00:33:53.549" style="s2">game particularly we even this call</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.700" end="00:33:55.380" style="s2">those who ultimately perceive it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.549" end="00:33:56.519" style="s2">gonna want everybody else to play or at</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.380" end="00:33:58.139" style="s2">least a whole lot of people to play</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.519" end="00:34:00.269" style="s2">which means it&#39;s gotta look like things</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.139" end="00:34:01.830" style="s2">they know how to play it&#39;s unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.269" end="00:34:04.110" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be able to teleport away</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.830" end="00:34:05.429" style="s2">from money in a single move because</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.110" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">people&#39;s don&#39;t really know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.429" end="00:34:11.129" style="s2">things yet without using money cool but</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:13.379" style="s2">we can change money and particularly can</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.129" end="00:34:16.349" style="s2">change money in two or three very</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.379" end="00:34:18.839" style="s2">important ways one was just like used to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.349" end="00:34:21.329" style="s2">use be at ubi as a metaphor ubi is like</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.839" end="00:34:23.579" style="s2">but the veil is thin the veil on ubi is</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.329" end="00:34:25.260" style="s2">so freaking finis incredible just right</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.579" end="00:34:27.389" style="s2">there and this article that I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.260" end="00:34:29.669" style="s2">referring by the way which is very wordy</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.389" end="00:34:31.409" style="s2">they kind of gets the point is you guys</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.669" end="00:34:34.020" style="s2">are kind of moved that it may actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.409" end="00:34:36.149" style="s2">seem very much like stuff we already</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.020" end="00:34:37.829" style="s2">understand really well but it does it</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.149" end="00:34:40.290" style="s2">changes some things at the bottom line</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.290" end="00:34:44.790" style="s2">characteristics where in a single move</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:47.700" style="s2">you could sever a lot of stuff we just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.790" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2">have never needed but you could also</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.700" end="00:34:52.859" style="s2">change the thing that we&#39;re doing in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.270" end="00:34:55.290" style="s2">way that the superficial level seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.859" end="00:34:56.819" style="s2">very ordinary but actually is profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.290" end="00:34:59.130" style="s2">changing at the bottom like the</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.140" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">whatever would happen is that then there</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.819" end="00:35:07.740" style="s2">would be a natural migration to a new</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:09.630" style="s2">place as you would if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.740" end="00:35:11.130" style="s2">the game be is uphill right now you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.630" end="00:35:14.520" style="s2">would tilt the table so game B is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.130" end="00:35:15.780" style="s2">downhill people are still gonna end up</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.780" end="00:35:19.180" style="s2">get there but and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.170" end="00:35:22.299" style="s2">being much more my natural direction of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.180" end="00:35:23.380" style="s2">the environment so to me the move is and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.299" end="00:35:26.020" style="s2">where I&#39;m certain focus on my own</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.380" end="00:35:28.119" style="s2">personal energy is on endeavoring to</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.119" end="00:35:33.160" style="s2">characteristics of a material shift and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.180" end="00:35:35.170" style="s2">then in the game that we are currently</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.160" end="00:35:38.920" style="s2">playing is potentially available now or</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.170" end="00:35:45.130" style="s2">would be made available as the moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.920" end="00:35:46.829" style="s2">increases in intensity and breadth that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.130" end="00:35:50.319" style="s2">is nonetheless in the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.829" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">how do we sever those things that just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.319" end="00:35:56.010" style="s2">stupid just should go away and then how</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:57.940" style="s2">do we create and redesign where</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.010" end="00:36:00.130" style="s2">superficially it&#39;s not that different</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.940" end="00:36:01.780" style="s2">from what we&#39;re very used to but at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.130" end="00:36:03.609" style="s2">generator function at the bottom is</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.780" end="00:36:05.260" style="s2">completely different and it comes from a</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.260" end="00:36:08.770" style="s2">from abundance rather than scarcity as</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.329" end="00:36:20.319" style="s2">the sort of disciplines been putting it</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.770" end="00:36:22.119" style="s2">I hope that was helpful so for me I seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.319" end="00:36:30.579" style="s2">this question a couple of times last</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.119" end="00:36:34.450" style="s2">nice to be from Joe can you sure hi</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.579" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2">Jordan my question comes about in one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.450" end="00:36:38.109" style="s2">your recent talks you mentioned or</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:40.869" style="s2">someone asked you about Eve on Ilitch</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.109" end="00:36:43.540" style="s2">and you said that you got most right on</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.869" end="00:36:45.430" style="s2">education so I&#39;ve been reading him since</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.540" end="00:36:49.049" style="s2">the last time I spoke about him</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.430" end="00:36:52.030" style="s2">so the question goes like this it says</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.049" end="00:36:54.849" style="s2">so paying attention is the sort of game</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.030" end="00:36:57.160" style="s2">B crowd and other sort of anti</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.849" end="00:36:59.890" style="s2">institutional thinkers it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.160" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">reveals a world which is existentially</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.890" end="00:37:05.319" style="s2">fragile it actually punishes virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:07.540" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly transferring wealth from</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.319" end="00:37:10.180" style="s2">people who are vulnerable to people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.540" end="00:37:13.420" style="s2">are physicians of strategic leverage my</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.180" end="00:37:15.369" style="s2">question is how is it possible for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.420" end="00:37:17.579" style="s2">person and in my case a young person</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.369" end="00:37:21.069" style="s2">about to enter into this world as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.579" end="00:37:23.549" style="s2">laborer to participate in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.069" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">without an overwhelming feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.549" end="00:37:28.569" style="s2">resentment for the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:30.680" style="s2">which you inherit and also the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.569" end="00:37:34.310" style="s2">which drive this structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.680" end="00:37:36.620" style="s2">and continue to extract resources from</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.310" end="00:37:39.740" style="s2">it so Peter actually put it in other</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.620" end="00:37:42.440" style="s2">words he said what is right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.740" end="00:37:46.840" style="s2">with resentment look like when you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.440" end="00:37:48.290" style="s2">to participate in that which you resent</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.840" end="00:37:55.160" style="s2">nice</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.290" end="00:37:57.080" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful like Oh neat you</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.160" end="00:37:59.930" style="s2">actually made a very nice distinction</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.080" end="00:38:01.190" style="s2">between resentment and resent Amal so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.930" end="00:38:04.610" style="s2">avoid resent him Oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.190" end="00:38:05.840" style="s2">like like really seriously deeply resent</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.610" end="00:38:09.710" style="s2">Aman is what happens when you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.840" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">internalized resentment and have created</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.710" end="00:38:17.000" style="s2">a narrative and ideology that how much</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:19.310" style="s2">for this right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.000" end="00:38:20.900" style="s2">circumstance where you ultimately end up</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.310" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">actually participating in your own</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.900" end="00:38:29.630" style="s2">enslavement by virtue of believing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">agency occurs by pointing a blaming</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.630" end="00:38:36.020" style="s2">finger aggressively so relent amok says</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:40.010" style="s2">this this thing that I&#39;m entering into</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.020" end="00:38:42.500" style="s2">sucks but it&#39;s but but I&#39;m so weak and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.010" end="00:38:44.870" style="s2">so overwhelmed I cannot possibly change</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.500" end="00:38:47.960" style="s2">it so what it does is instead of instead</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.870" end="00:38:50.360" style="s2">of having real agency it invents false</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.960" end="00:38:52.100" style="s2">agency and says that oh well pointing my</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.360" end="00:38:54.830" style="s2">finger at it and complaining vigorously</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.100" end="00:38:57.470" style="s2">about it is agency per se and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.830" end="00:38:59.420" style="s2">feeling of agency replaces actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.470" end="00:39:01.130" style="s2">agencies this is the trap and of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.420" end="00:39:03.230" style="s2">at that point you&#39;re hopelessly trapped</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.130" end="00:39:06.080" style="s2">because you also are easily manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.230" end="00:39:07.580" style="s2">and to just you know you blame them they</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.080" end="00:39:09.890" style="s2">blame you everybody feels like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.580" end="00:39:11.510" style="s2">their self righteously like exercising</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.890" end="00:39:15.980" style="s2">their feeling and resentment and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.510" end="00:39:17.780" style="s2">nothing changes so what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.980" end="00:39:20.750" style="s2">to recognize it&#39;s such a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.780" end="00:39:25.550" style="s2">as listening to the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.750" end="00:39:27.950" style="s2">describing it the feeling of resentment</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.550" end="00:39:31.940" style="s2">just like the feelings of anger and of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.950" end="00:39:35.570" style="s2">fear is a perception first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.940" end="00:39:38.990" style="s2">of a state of reality that has a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.570" end="00:39:43.220" style="s2">wrongness to it and a an awakening or a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.990" end="00:39:44.680" style="s2">an activation of an energy and self to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.220" end="00:39:49.369" style="s2">respond to that wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.680" end="00:39:51.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what that energy is the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.369" end="00:39:55.070" style="s2">you begin the process of Meerut izing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.800" end="00:39:57.800" style="s2">could be in trouble let me you attach</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.070" end="00:40:01.940" style="s2">meaning-making to perception is where</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.800" end="00:40:03.079" style="s2">things get challenging and so the simple</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.940" end="00:40:05.300" style="s2">answer is to say first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.079" end="00:40:06.950" style="s2">allow the feeling to be the feeling but</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.300" end="00:40:08.390" style="s2">do not attempt to attach the feeling to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.950" end="00:40:10.970" style="s2">the way that you make meaning about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.390" end="00:40:13.369" style="s2">feeling particularly to the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.970" end="00:40:16.910" style="s2">which you&#39;re you&#39;re engaging in meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.369" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">making third person to the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.910" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">which somebody else&#39;s story is the story</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:23.150" style="s2">that you&#39;re using to make sense of your</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.150" end="00:40:27.410" style="s2">be post-structuralist sorr it could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.490" end="00:40:29.030" style="s2">libertarians it doesn&#39;t matter as soon</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.410" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">as somebody else&#39;s narrative is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.030" end="00:40:32.210" style="s2">you&#39;re using to make sense up to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:34.220" style="s2">meaning out of your feeling you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.210" end="00:40:36.760" style="s2">definitely gonna be in trouble okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.220" end="00:40:39.170" style="s2">great I think it&#39;s perfectly appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.760" end="00:40:41.810" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna teen is accurate to feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.170" end="00:40:45.109" style="s2">resentment in that context that is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.810" end="00:40:46.460" style="s2">appropriate emotion feeling but then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.109" end="00:40:48.500" style="s2">say okay well what does resentment do or</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.460" end="00:40:50.420" style="s2">resentment does is resentment Orient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.500" end="00:40:53.750" style="s2">me towards the wrongness okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.420" end="00:40:54.680" style="s2">now I know which direction is if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.750" end="00:40:57.589" style="s2">sailing a boat I know which direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.680" end="00:41:00.050" style="s2">the wind is coming from but then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.589" end="00:41:03.890" style="s2">have to be very serious then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.050" end="00:41:10.490" style="s2">say okay strategic effectiveness cannot</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.890" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">be surrendered for a feeling or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.490" end="00:41:15.140" style="s2">sensation of effectiveness I have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:16.700" style="s2">actually recognize that the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.140" end="00:41:19.640" style="s2">resolve the resemble is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.700" end="00:41:23.420" style="s2">resolve the situation that I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.640" end="00:41:25.220" style="s2">in and that&#39;s has to be recognized as</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.420" end="00:41:26.210" style="s2">decidedly non-trivial in fact it may</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.220" end="00:41:29.540" style="s2">take generations</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.210" end="00:41:31.880" style="s2">I may be fucked in terms of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.540" end="00:41:33.500" style="s2">but I may be able to cast the movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.880" end="00:41:35.960" style="s2">that Orient&#39;s enough people to be able</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.500" end="00:41:38.030" style="s2">to slog directionally such that three</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.960" end="00:41:40.790" style="s2">generations hence this thing that is</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.790" end="00:41:44.750" style="s2">a very powerful mindset a powerful mind</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.110" end="00:43:24.620" style="s2">well that was great</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.030" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">I like the sailing analogy and it brings</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.620" end="00:43:45.140" style="s2">up one of the questions from Michael&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:47.210" style="s2">Sicilian Sicily on yes hello my fourth</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.140" end="00:43:49.580" style="s2">question is what are you force about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.210" end="00:43:52.040" style="s2">new roles and identities we have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.580" end="00:43:54.440" style="s2">playing whedon and training and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.040" end="00:43:57.170" style="s2">employing to sail and navigate this</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.440" end="00:43:59.180" style="s2">increasingly shopping see like the booka</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.170" end="00:44:01.310" style="s2">booka well something important talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.180" end="00:44:03.560" style="s2">about the game the game be well as but</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.310" end="00:44:05.510" style="s2">what but what steps can we take now and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.560" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">start training and playing we grow new</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.510" end="00:44:10.460" style="s2">roles and identities like reframing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">renaming old roles or completely new</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.460" end="00:44:13.900" style="s2">roles</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:15.400" style="s2">yeah so the the thing that the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.900" end="00:44:17.800" style="s2">pops in my head is this notion of stem</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.400" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">cell and to make that a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.800" end="00:44:24.820" style="s2">clear what I mean is there&#39;s there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:29.050" style="s2">potential or portent eeeh and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.820" end="00:44:36.520" style="s2">actual and I would say one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.050" end="00:44:39.190" style="s2">primary addictions or maladaptive the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.520" end="00:44:41.710" style="s2">world in which we currently live is an</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.190" end="00:44:45.160" style="s2">extraordinary bias towards identities</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.710" end="00:44:46.150" style="s2">that are actual oh gosh I&#39;m sorry I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.160" end="00:44:47.380" style="s2">so many things going on in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.150" end="00:44:49.600" style="s2">visually I&#39;m having a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.380" end="00:44:52.270" style="s2">remembering one what is already in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.600" end="00:44:56.100" style="s2">head and two what I&#39;ve already said so</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.270" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">what I mean by actual is this like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.100" end="00:45:00.730" style="s2">have you ever played a brand-new video</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:02.320" style="s2">game like you you&#39;re you&#39;re playing a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.730" end="00:45:03.790" style="s2">game I don&#39;t know if civilization or</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.320" end="00:45:06.970" style="s2">something like that where you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.790" end="00:45:09.220" style="s2">played it before and so you or puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.970" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">I&#39;ll use purse so I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.220" end="00:45:12.730" style="s2">puzzle it&#39;s in the box I take the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:16.810" style="s2">I dump them out on the table and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.730" end="00:45:19.300" style="s2">a moment of intense mystery oh I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.810" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">what this is gonna be that&#39;s firstness</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.300" end="00:45:23.230" style="s2">in the personal sense and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:25.510" style="s2">the moment at which there&#39;s a transition</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.230" end="00:45:27.670" style="s2">from that to something that has now a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.510" end="00:45:29.350" style="s2">bounded domain there now there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.670" end="00:45:30.670" style="s2">actuality to it you found the corners</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.350" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">and the edges and the puzzle now has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.670" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">certain ah whatever happens it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:37.720" style="s2">be inside this box that&#39;s the transition</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">into the actual then there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.720" end="00:45:40.420" style="s2">movement from the second mister third</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.310" style="s2">miss and again in the personal sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.420" end="00:45:45.580" style="s2">which is the process of getting really</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.310" end="00:45:47.500" style="s2">really good at optimizing for that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.580" end="00:45:49.210" style="s2">puzzle are you sort by colors yet if I</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.500" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">were the what are the shapes that matter</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.210" end="00:45:54.280" style="s2">like you begin the process of solving</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:56.740" style="s2">the puzzle so our world is a world that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.280" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">lives in third ness it&#39;s a world where</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.740" end="00:46:01.570" style="s2">identities are identities that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:03.700" style="s2">optimized for being pieces of a machine</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.570" end="00:46:05.380" style="s2">that is itself optimized for solving</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.700" end="00:46:07.300" style="s2">problems they were pulled out of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.380" end="00:46:10.150" style="s2">mystery whale well before our</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.300" end="00:46:12.100" style="s2">grandparents were born okay in this new</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.150" end="00:46:14.110" style="s2">environment in the new environment there</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.100" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">is an equipoise between the potentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.110" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">actual we always returned back to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.370" style="s2">bottom of the you I guess to use that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:24.430" style="s2">that terminology we become we go into</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.370" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">being tissues we become heart cells or</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.430" end="00:46:27.530" style="s2">nerve cells in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:29.690" style="s2">organ organism and then we return back</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.530" end="00:46:33.640" style="s2">to being stem cells and so the current</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.690" end="00:46:36.080" style="s2">primary identity is that identity of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.640" end="00:46:38.380" style="s2">polymorph the identity of the stem cell</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.080" end="00:46:40.370" style="s2">the identity of the thing that is is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.380" end="00:46:42.260" style="s2">fundamentally oriented towards the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.370" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">relationship between the potential the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.260" end="00:46:46.130" style="s2">actual it has the capacity to sense in</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:48.530" style="s2">the sum of the possibilities that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.130" end="00:46:50.270" style="s2">emerging and it&#39;s not in any way yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.530" end="00:46:53.060" style="s2">binding them or constrained them by</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.270" end="00:46:55.430" style="s2">preconceived fractured structures in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.060" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">actual but is actually allowing them yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.430" end="00:47:01.420" style="s2">a blurry potentiality thank you allowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:04.700" style="s2">them to show up and then has a</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.420" end="00:47:07.670" style="s2">skillfulness at in the time that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.700" end="00:47:10.220" style="s2">right in the time it is is is not too</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.670" end="00:47:11.870" style="s2">fast or too slow to render them into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.220" end="00:47:14.330" style="s2">actual but they&#39;re not gonna become</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.870" end="00:47:15.770" style="s2">bound to that so that I&#39;d say is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.330" end="00:47:19.510" style="s2">fundamental now of course what that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.770" end="00:47:21.350" style="s2">means is that the actualizations</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.510" end="00:47:23.240" style="s2">identity is that in some sense we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.350" end="00:47:29.180" style="s2">put a pin and write a name against our</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.240" end="00:47:30.980" style="s2">now very large I wanted to say infinite</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.180" end="00:47:32.450" style="s2">but I have to hesitate because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.980" end="00:47:34.100" style="s2">strictly infinite it&#39;s that thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.450" end="00:47:38.510" style="s2">is the limit as X approaches infinity</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.100" end="00:47:41.210" style="s2">there will be innumerable identities and</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.510" end="00:47:44.450" style="s2">one will flit in and out of them and may</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.210" end="00:47:46.340" style="s2">in fact spend many - you may be a given</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.450" end="00:47:49.370" style="s2">identity structure for four minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.340" end="00:47:50.840" style="s2">then flip to another one in serial and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.370" end="00:47:52.850" style="s2">and you may pull in and out of them as</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.840" end="00:47:54.500" style="s2">well and I think that&#39;s the key find</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.850" end="00:47:55.850" style="s2">that that notion and the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.500" end="00:47:57.080" style="s2">actually nailed this in the PostScript</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.850" end="00:47:58.460" style="s2">since inside of the controls if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.080" end="00:48:00.650" style="s2">gonna double click on that and look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.460" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">what early 90s language for that looks</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.650" end="00:48:05.210" style="s2">like it creates a nice paralyzed but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:06.980" style="s2">think that&#39;s the essence of it all right</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.210" end="00:48:08.780" style="s2">the essence is a building fundamental</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.480" end="00:48:46.760" style="s2">the past 20 or 30 years because of the</p>

<p begin="00:49:01.160" end="00:49:04.280" style="s2">requires that level of specializations</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.660" end="00:49:07.580" style="s2">and sometimes you need to become a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.280" end="00:49:08.900" style="s2">plumber and then come back up I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.580" end="00:49:10.580" style="s2">about that again very practical I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.900" end="00:49:11.090" style="s2">how quickly these days we can learn new</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.580" end="00:49:12.560" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.090" end="00:49:14.180" style="s2">I actually thought it&#39;d be a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.560" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">game to play as to ask people what new</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.180" end="00:49:20.180" style="s2">skills have you learned under quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:21.560" style="s2">and it should be many like because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.180" end="00:49:23.720" style="s2">can watch a youtube video and learn</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.560" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">stuff fast these days like I actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.720" end="00:49:27.350" style="s2">built a whole cedar hot tub and learned</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:29.210" style="s2">how to be a plumber learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.350" end="00:49:31.190" style="s2">electrician behind my electrician I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.210" end="00:49:32.840" style="s2">not the whole array of plumbing an</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.190" end="00:49:35.060" style="s2">electrician but for that sub-domain</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.840" end="00:49:37.010" style="s2">skills that I had zero coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.060" end="00:49:40.850" style="s2">actually built a real thing that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.010" end="00:49:43.210" style="s2">water warm and doesn&#39;t leak by watching</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.850" end="00:49:45.950" style="s2">youtube videos and think about that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.210" end="00:49:47.570" style="s2">everybody can do that now so to build</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.950" end="00:49:49.640" style="s2">the skill learning about learning like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.570" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">metal learning to build metal learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.640" end="00:49:54.080" style="s2">as a competence and to be able to access</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:56.180" style="s2">the universal flow of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.080" end="00:49:58.130" style="s2">competence in all these subdomains who</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.180" end="00:50:00.080" style="s2">can render that into curricula that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.130" end="00:50:02.330" style="s2">can absorb quickly iterate on in</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.080" end="00:50:03.560" style="s2">practice and actually build functional</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.330" end="00:50:07.090" style="s2">skill like good enough to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.560" end="00:50:07.090" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do that&#39;s the future</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.360" end="00:50:14.510" style="s2">right I&#39;m excited because I think it</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.540" end="00:50:17.660" style="s2">connects to question around liminality</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.510" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">this one that Peter put the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.660" end="00:50:21.500" style="s2">question in the chat that we finally</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:27.100" style="s2">could get back to it so the passage of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.500" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">Peter to ask us a question all right</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.100" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">feels like this one has already been</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:33.860" style="s2">answered but maybe I&#39;ll ask it anyways</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:37.070" style="s2">cuz the frame might inspire some</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.860" end="00:50:39.530" style="s2">thoughts this is the very first question</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.070" end="00:50:42.380" style="s2">so one how are you building right</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.530" end="00:50:43.970" style="s2">relationship with the liminal and B how</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.380" end="00:50:45.590" style="s2">do you recommend others in the general</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.970" end="00:50:47.890" style="s2">sense build right relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.590" end="00:50:47.890" style="s2">liminal</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:56.540" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s see well I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.250" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.590" end="00:51:17.050" style="s2">obviously first slow down the liminal is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.940" end="00:51:21.360" style="s2">one of these things where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.050" end="00:51:24.370" style="s2">it&#39;s subtle and easily disturbed and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.360" end="00:51:27.220" style="s2">learning how to not muddy the waters and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.370" end="00:51:29.380" style="s2">to move slowly through the water so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.220" end="00:51:32.380" style="s2">you can perceive what is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.380" end="00:51:37.090" style="s2">actually being expressed is first and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.380" end="00:51:39.850" style="s2">foremost the liminal teaches us how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.090" end="00:51:41.800" style="s2">perceive the luminol so as we build</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.850" end="00:51:44.110" style="s2">skillfulness and not muddying the waters</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.800" end="00:51:46.450" style="s2">and not creating ripples and then simply</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.110" end="00:51:48.910" style="s2">listen to what is being taught always</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.450" end="00:51:52.210" style="s2">everywhere every aspect of experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.910" end="00:51:54.700" style="s2">contains the lesson we find that every</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.210" end="00:51:57.400" style="s2">opportunity the experience is contains</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.700" end="00:51:59.740" style="s2">in it the lesson that is enabling us to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.400" end="00:52:02.430" style="s2">increase our capacity for relationality</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.740" end="00:52:02.430" style="s2">with the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">more intense the experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.130" end="00:52:12.890" style="s2">the more skillful skillfulness is needed</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.859" end="00:52:16.700" style="s2">to hold</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.890" end="00:52:19.460" style="s2">that stillness so as to allow the lesson</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.700" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">to unfold itself in us</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.460" end="00:52:24.230" style="s2">which by the way in many cases also</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:26.470" style="s2">takes a great deal of time and so it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.230" end="00:52:29.180" style="s2">not simply the case of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.470" end="00:52:30.740" style="s2">listen in the moment but to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.180" end="00:52:34.309" style="s2">learn the skillfulness of holding the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.740" end="00:52:36.980" style="s2">piece in oneself to allow the lesson to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.309" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2">unfold over what may be days or weeks or</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.980" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2">months or years</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.190" end="00:52:48.180" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of all the classic words</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.799" end="00:52:48.180" style="s2">humility peace</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.609" end="00:52:57.509" style="s2">gratitude deserve saying serve a key and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.410" end="00:52:59.910" style="s2">I have been sitting I think or were</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.509" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">doing spinning some the next time just</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.910" end="00:53:05.539" style="s2">grabbing words like gratitude I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.880" end="00:53:09.869" style="s2">to dust them off and recover them</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.539" end="00:53:11.249" style="s2">gratitude is a it&#39;s a state that is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.869" end="00:53:12.599" style="s2">disposition I&#39;m going to do is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.249" end="00:53:15.989" style="s2">relationship with the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.599" end="00:53:17.910" style="s2">possibility you can have gratitude for</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.989" end="00:53:20.460" style="s2">something but that is very much a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.910" end="00:53:22.109" style="s2">denatured example and you can work your</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.460" end="00:53:23.670" style="s2">way back you can imagine things for</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.109" end="00:53:25.890" style="s2">which you are grateful to remind you of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.670" end="00:53:28.170" style="s2">what it what the feeling of gratitude is</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.890" end="00:53:30.450" style="s2">but the the practice of gratitude is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.170" end="00:53:32.430" style="s2">practice of actually placing yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.450" end="00:53:34.170" style="s2">the pure state of gratitude in</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.430" end="00:53:36.589" style="s2">relationship to the whole of reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.170" end="00:53:38.670" style="s2">without regard to a particular object</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.589" end="00:53:41.249" style="s2">the same thing is true the course of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.670" end="00:53:42.779" style="s2">humility and so to practice those and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.249" end="00:53:46.829" style="s2">learn how to flex and exercise those</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.779" end="00:53:49.020" style="s2">muscles I think is it a useful skill in</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.829" end="00:53:52.030" style="s2">this context</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.020" end="00:53:53.740" style="s2">so what I&#39;m getting from that is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.030" end="00:53:55.960" style="s2">felt sense reality is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.740" end="00:53:59.940" style="s2">liminal just really sink into that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.960" end="00:53:59.940" style="s2">sort of map that over with the concept</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.720" end="00:54:14.370" style="s2">yeah the concept feels off to me it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.330" end="00:54:14.370" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s more like the competence</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.780" end="00:54:22.570" style="s2">the conformity the grasping to sink in</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.140" end="00:54:34.390" style="s2">and then she simply had become too have</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.570" end="00:54:38.920" style="s2">become grown into it right awesome like</p>
