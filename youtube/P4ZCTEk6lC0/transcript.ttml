<p begin="00:19:58.190" end="00:20:02.210" style="s2">breathing very well because there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.379" end="00:20:04.820" style="s2">actually some meditation traditions</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">actually break up following the breath</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.820" end="00:20:10.639" style="s2">into you feel the expansion there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.190" end="00:20:12.649" style="s2">pause there&#39;s that gap and then you feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.639" end="00:20:15.139" style="s2">the contraction there&#39;s a pause you feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.649" end="00:20:18.289" style="s2">that gap this tradition doesn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.139" end="00:20:20.809" style="s2">but you might be noticing that gap you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.289" end="00:20:21.889" style="s2">might be associate it&#39;s particularly you</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.809" end="00:20:24.409" style="s2">could use with it some pranayama</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.889" end="00:20:26.179" style="s2">traditions especially but you might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.409" end="00:20:27.649" style="s2">noticing that gap if you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.179" end="00:20:29.330" style="s2">you&#39;re over stretched if you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.649" end="00:20:30.830" style="s2">you&#39;re just doing it naturally it might</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.330" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">be that what&#39;s happening is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.830" end="00:20:35.509" style="s2">actually noticing that extension and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:37.429" style="s2">that brief pause so if you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.509" end="00:20:39.169" style="s2">you&#39;re pushing it then of course trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.429" end="00:20:41.240" style="s2">to let it go even more to people as</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.169" end="00:20:42.679" style="s2">natural as possible but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.240" end="00:20:44.659" style="s2">honestly say no I&#39;m not pushing it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.679" end="00:20:47.809" style="s2">just hopping naturally you might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.659" end="00:20:50.059" style="s2">noticing that pause and actually feeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.809" end="00:20:52.279" style="s2">that period when your abdomen is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.059" end="00:20:54.620" style="s2">extended or contracted and that might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.279" end="00:20:56.269" style="s2">making it more salient for you and if</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.620" end="00:20:58.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the case instead of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.269" end="00:20:59.330" style="s2">it as a negative thing oh no think of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.460" end="00:21:01.759" style="s2">as a positive things</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.330" end="00:21:03.830" style="s2">oh no I&#39;m tracking my breath so well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.759" end="00:21:05.779" style="s2">actually picking up on that pause and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.830" end="00:21:08.889" style="s2">I&#39;m just getting that sense of expansion</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.779" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense of contraction I</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.990" end="00:21:18.379" style="s2">of what I started to call storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.669" end="00:21:19.909" style="s2">usually about my past that seems</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.379" end="00:21:21.830" style="s2">significant but not sure why any</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.580" end="00:21:30.590" style="s2">so there your brain is basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.889" end="00:21:32.340" style="s2">oriented two ways it&#39;s task oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.590" end="00:21:34.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple networks</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.340" end="00:21:36.210" style="s2">and this is when your attention is out</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.410" end="00:21:38.250" style="s2">and directed on the task like when</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.210" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">you&#39;re following your breath but</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.250" end="00:21:42.750" style="s2">typically when we disengage from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:44.190" style="s2">world and close our eyes especially we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.750" end="00:21:46.230" style="s2">close our eyes but even we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.190" end="00:21:48.060" style="s2">disengaging we get mind-wandering</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.230" end="00:21:50.070" style="s2">that&#39;s another network that&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.060" end="00:21:51.810" style="s2">default mode Network and it&#39;s adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.070" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">it has very important functions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.810" end="00:21:57.090" style="s2">why we spend so much time in it and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:59.580" style="s2">and that default mode network is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.090" end="00:22:03.660" style="s2">basically very self referential it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.580" end="00:22:05.070" style="s2">about your we tell stories we do mental</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.660" end="00:22:06.780" style="s2">time travel so you&#39;re telling months of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.070" end="00:22:07.170" style="s2">stories about the past this is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.780" end="00:22:10.020" style="s2">normal</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.170" end="00:22:11.610" style="s2">some people Robin Hart Harris and other</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:13.380" style="s2">cognitive scientists think the default</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.610" end="00:22:15.510" style="s2">mode Network is where we&#39;re both where</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.380" end="00:22:17.400" style="s2">we&#39;re building a lot of what in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.510" end="00:22:19.460" style="s2">these traditions is called the ego this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.400" end="00:22:24.660" style="s2">sort of self referential</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.460" end="00:22:26.580" style="s2">autobiographical thing thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.660" end="00:22:28.410" style="s2">identify with and that is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.580" end="00:22:31.110" style="s2">constraining and modifying all of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.410" end="00:22:33.480" style="s2">other cognition and part of what might</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.110" end="00:22:35.610" style="s2">be going on is in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.480" end="00:22:38.370" style="s2">we&#39;re triggering that but we&#39;re also</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.370" end="00:22:43.470" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing them together so that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.890" end="00:22:45.510" style="s2">can get a new configuration we can get</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.470" end="00:22:47.940" style="s2">something beyond because normally when</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.510" end="00:22:50.040" style="s2">one shuts on when one turns on the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.940" end="00:22:52.110" style="s2">shuts off they go like this right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.040" end="00:22:55.170" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do this and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.110" end="00:22:57.420" style="s2">normal for the all of this time travel</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.170" end="00:23:00.510" style="s2">and storytelling to come up but you keep</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.420" end="00:23:03.000" style="s2">breaking up it&#39;s automaticity you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.510" end="00:23:05.790" style="s2">more and more the capacity that these</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.000" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">might actually interweave with each</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.790" end="00:23:10.590" style="s2">other and that brings about a profound</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:13.740" style="s2">kind of insight and change it it has the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.590" end="00:23:15.750" style="s2">capacity to radically transform your</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.740" end="00:23:17.990" style="s2">sense of self and your sense of being in</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.750" end="00:23:20.970" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.990" end="00:23:22.530" style="s2">Austin Collins during matters should I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.970" end="00:23:24.060" style="s2">be having a discussion with myself about</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.530" end="00:23:26.370" style="s2">the categories that I&#39;m assigning and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.060" end="00:23:28.860" style="s2">assuming he&#39;s a friend whether role does</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.370" end="00:23:31.710" style="s2">he know what else could he be yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.860" end="00:23:34.530" style="s2">so Austin this is part of a general</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.710" end="00:23:35.910" style="s2">thing that I tell people because it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.530" end="00:23:37.470" style="s2">kind of confusing because well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.910" end="00:23:40.440" style="s2">supposed to be you know talking in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.470" end="00:23:41.640" style="s2">mind the one thing that&#39;s excluded from</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.440" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">that and this was like the raft in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.640" end="00:23:44.970" style="s2">Buddhist tradition the Buddha told the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:45.779" style="s2">story about a man who built a raft to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.970" end="00:23:47.969" style="s2">get across</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.779" end="00:23:49.499" style="s2">River and once he&#39;s on across the river</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.969" end="00:23:51.299" style="s2">he holds on to the raft</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.499" end="00:23:53.399" style="s2">the raft is useful while you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.299" end="00:23:54.599" style="s2">river it&#39;s transitional but once you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.399" end="00:23:56.609" style="s2">to that place you don&#39;t need the raft</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.599" end="00:23:58.139" style="s2">anymore you have to put it away but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.609" end="00:24:00.179" style="s2">also wrong to say well I don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.139" end="00:24:02.549" style="s2">raft to try to walk through the river</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.179" end="00:24:04.529" style="s2">right from the beginning so at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.549" end="00:24:05.940" style="s2">beginning you have to coach yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.529" end="00:24:07.979" style="s2">have to talk yourself this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.940" end="00:24:10.469" style="s2">learn a lot of skills we talk to ourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.979" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">and we coach ourselves if your inner</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.469" end="00:24:16.950" style="s2">speech is coaching speech it is fine but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.809" style="s2">try to and if you watch good coaches at</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.950" end="00:24:20.969" style="s2">first they talk a lot and then they</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.809" end="00:24:22.679" style="s2">slowly diminish because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.969" end="00:24:23.849" style="s2">to talk to yourself when you walk into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.679" end="00:24:25.859" style="s2">room and sit down you don&#39;t have to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.849" end="00:24:27.599" style="s2">okay move this leg move that leg look</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.859" end="00:24:29.190" style="s2">around sit down you&#39;ve built up the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.599" end="00:24:31.710" style="s2">skill and then you can do what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.190" end="00:24:33.839" style="s2">you right use the skill so coaching</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.710" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">yourself inner speech for coaching is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.839" end="00:24:38.489" style="s2">completely legitimate it&#39;s a raft but</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.299" end="00:24:40.979" style="s2">don&#39;t get attached to it expect it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.489" end="00:24:43.409" style="s2">gradually very gradually to diminish</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.979" end="00:24:46.349" style="s2">until you can just do those things</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.409" end="00:24:47.609" style="s2">without having to talk to yourself just</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.349" end="00:24:50.039" style="s2">like you can look around the room to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.609" end="00:24:54.059" style="s2">what&#39;s different without having to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.039" end="00:24:55.950" style="s2">to yourself deniz mentis not sure if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.059" end="00:24:57.839" style="s2">doing medically I reviewed the lesson</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:24:59.519" style="s2">but after each mantra it&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.839" end="00:25:01.409" style="s2">difficult to identify specific thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.519" end="00:25:02.309" style="s2">related to my roller model should I</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.409" end="00:25:04.739" style="s2">pause longer</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.309" end="00:25:06.509" style="s2">yes pause a bit longer but perhaps and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.739" end="00:25:08.190" style="s2">also don&#39;t think that the only thing you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.509" end="00:25:10.529" style="s2">should be finding are thoughts you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.190" end="00:25:12.389" style="s2">should be finding feelings you should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.529" end="00:25:14.969" style="s2">finding places where your attention goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.389" end="00:25:16.469" style="s2">in your body or where your attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.969" end="00:25:18.899" style="s2">wants to go in your memory or in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.469" end="00:25:21.929" style="s2">world those are also ways in which you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.899" end="00:25:24.779" style="s2">get answers to your questions so pause</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.929" end="00:25:29.669" style="s2">longer and broaden your scope of what</p>
