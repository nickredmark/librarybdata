<p begin="00:00:05.660" end="00:00:08.210" style="s2">This is a question that really touches<br />me personally</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.210" end="00:00:12.559" style="s2">because as I become more involved in<br />veganism and become more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.559" end="00:00:13.529" style="s2">animal rights,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.529" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s really been difficult for me to<br />retain the same amount of compassion for other</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:20.350" style="s2">humans, especially other humans that are hurting animals, as I fo for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.350" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">other animals so what is the best way to<br />retain compassion for non-vegans</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:26.150" style="s2">while still promoting veganism?</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.150" end="00:00:29.560" style="s2">My diet is what you would call vegan,</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.560" end="00:00:33.320" style="s2">but I don&#39;t really say</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.320" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">often anymore, &quot;I am a vegan&quot; I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">that I don&#39;t eat animal products but<br />identifying</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">with any kind of label that excludes<br />others ends up being the basis for</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.120" end="00:00:50.890" style="s2">limiting where our compassion extends and then the basis for conflict.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.890" end="00:00:54.250" style="s2">And so we want to not just be</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.250" end="00:00:57.390" style="s2">Americans or you know,</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.390" end="00:01:01.239" style="s2">Christians or whatever limited group.<br />We want to be citizens of the planet. And we</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.239" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">want to be not just human</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:06.280" style="s2">citizens but earthlings, we want to<br />continue to expand our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.280" end="00:01:07.820" style="s2">connectedness to the rest of life</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.820" end="00:01:12.009" style="s2">and so I think there&#39;s even an identity<br />level of I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.009" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">a vegan or an animal activist as opposed to just, compassion is a deep value for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:16.670" style="s2">me.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.670" end="00:01:21.020" style="s2">Everybody actually values compassion<br />even if their circle hasn&#39;t extended as</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.020" end="00:01:23.549" style="s2">far yet. They value it towards their kids,<br />towards</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.549" end="00:01:27.530" style="s2">their pets usually, towards some<br />things. And then we identify again what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.530" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">the same between us not what&#39;s different<br />and then we get to have a basis for</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:31.180" style="s2">building from there</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.180" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">because with the exception of a few<br />people that were raised by very</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">conscious parents in this way,</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:42.820" style="s2">most about us ate meat while experiencing ourself as ethical, caring, loving people.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.820" end="00:01:47.869" style="s2">I did, right, and so the me today could<br />easily be judging the previous me as uncaring</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.869" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">and I wasn&#39;t uncaring, I was unaware.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:54.469" style="s2">And awareness requires more than just<br />hearing,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.469" end="00:01:57.530" style="s2">&quot;Oh, animals suffer somewhere,  it requires</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.530" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">actually getting it to change a lifelong<br />pattern that our whole family has done, our</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:04.009" style="s2">whole culture has done,</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.009" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">almost everybody around us has done<br />since we were a baby. And so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:10.369" style="s2">looking at changing something profound, we&#39;re looking at changing</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.369" end="00:02:14.190" style="s2">how someone supports their own life,<br />staying alive at like a multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.190" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">a day basis,</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">which is why the act to of becoming vegetarian is such a huge one,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:23.629" style="s2">because when you say, &quot;Hey the way that I support my staying alive and something</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.629" end="00:02:26.450" style="s2">that I do every day, multiple times and<br />something I&#39;ve done since</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.450" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">since I was an infant, I&#39;m gonna change that&quot;,  it&#39;s a huge chance.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:33.640" style="s2">And if you&#39;re changing it not just for<br />you, if you change for health reasons</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.640" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:38.129" style="s2">because they you learn another health fad and it just keeps changing but if you change</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.129" end="00:02:41.620" style="s2">a core way of how you support your life, that started</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.620" end="00:02:45.379" style="s2">early on and everyone around you is<br />still doing the other thing,</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.379" end="00:02:49.580" style="s2">for the  purpose of compassion,</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.580" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">then you&#39;re saying that compassion is<br />actually one of my core values and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">actually going to guide</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">the core aspects of my life by that<br />value and that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:01.970" style="s2">bleeding over into so many other areas.<br />You start recognizing, oh my purchases</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.970" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2">affect things in ways I they don&#39;t see. If I had to go to the factory farm to buy meat,</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.540" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">I would never get the meat but because the atrocity is somewhere else I don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:09.549" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.549" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2">What about landfills?  Isn&#39;t it like that<br />too? And now I&#39;m gonna start being conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:14.540" style="s2">about my waste.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.540" end="00:03:18.690" style="s2">What about, did may did my shoes<br />come from a place that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.690" end="00:03:22.049" style="s2">a using child slave labor? Was</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.049" end="00:03:26.030" style="s2">animal testing involved in my cosmetics?<br />And you start really taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.030" end="00:03:26.530" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.530" end="00:03:31.180" style="s2">the effects that are invisible to us if<br />we don&#39;t dig but that are very real</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.180" end="00:03:34.269" style="s2">in the matter to somebody else. And that<br />active saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.269" end="00:03:39.450" style="s2">compassion and responsibility for that<br />compassion come together as the core of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.450" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">my life.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:43.580" style="s2">That I&#39;m actually not just going have<br />compassion where I care but I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.580" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">anything about it, but</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:47.750" style="s2">I&#39;m going have compassion and I&#39;m going to act on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.750" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">and that becomes a central defining<br />thing about who I am. That&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">essential shift.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:57.140" style="s2">And it&#39;s my belief that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.140" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">everybody wants to have their life be a<br />positive impact on others&#39; lives,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:08.849" style="s2">as they get more informed and they get<br />more sensitized and that those who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.849" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">capable of causing more harm, whether it&#39;s to animals or anything,</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:15.829" style="s2">is both because of a lack of awareness, a lack of resources for other</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.829" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">opportunities and because of their own<br />hurts and wounds that have shut their</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:19.650" style="s2">empathy down.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.650" end="00:04:25.000" style="s2">And so it&#39;s really a process at helping<br />people to re-sensitize</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.000" end="00:04:29.180" style="s2">and to have new resources and strategies and have deeper awareness</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.180" end="00:04:32.580" style="s2">which means that going to attack them is the exact opposite of what would help.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.580" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">Recognizing our sameness with <br />them recognizing the goodness</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:37.900" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.900" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">that&#39;s there and then helping to both<br />healing offer new strategies is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:42.640" style="s2">relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.640" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a great point to close on and<br />I really appreciate you being with me</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">today.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:49.870" style="s2">I really look forward to delving deeper<br />into these topics with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.870" end="00:04:53.880" style="s2">and learning more about veganism. Thanks Michelle, I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.880" end="00:04:55.000" style="s2">excited about your blog</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.000" end="00:04:57.060" style="s2">and that you&#39;re sharing this with people.</p>
