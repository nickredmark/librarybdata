<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">is what do you think the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">fungi is at this point well I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">fungi is a critically important at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">stage in the evolution of life on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">planet simply for the fact that we look</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:31.019" style="s2">at evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:33.239" style="s2">we know there&#39;s been at least two major</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.019" end="00:00:34.309" style="s2">extinction events after which fungi</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.239" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">inherited the earth</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.309" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">250 million years ago there was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">greatest extinction more than 90% of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">species in the fossil record disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">suddenly and there&#39;s three theories one</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">the methane hydrate burst out of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">oceans volcanoes in Siberia or an</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">mutually exclusive the asteroid impact</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">could have triggered the volcanoes and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">the methane hydrate outburst but in any</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">event the earth became strident rather</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:00.890" style="s2">than dust</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a massive die-off of species and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.890" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">those organisms that associated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">fungi survived so fungi inherited the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">earth 250 million years ago after this</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:11.010" style="s2">big extinction event then 65 million</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">years ago we had another extinction of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.010" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">that the asteroid impact we know hit the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">earth and the earth was shrouded in dust</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">and the ratio of pollen to fungal spores</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">at the Pitti boundary of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">permian-triassic boundary was 10 to 1</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">and directly after that event there were</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:29.220" style="s2">no pollen spores for hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:30.509" style="s2">thousands of years all fungal spores so</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.220" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">we know that there&#39;s two extinction</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">events the lesson and the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:35.579" style="s2">life on this planet those organs that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">paired with fungi survived extinction</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.579" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">events now we&#39;re in 6x the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">extinction event seen since then and by</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">reports though it&#39;s a thousand times</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">more severe number one because we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">more species but we&#39;re losing thousand</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">times more species than they there seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:52.409" style="s2">to have done previously in history so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:55.409" style="s2">live in our lifetimes we think</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.409" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">everything&#39;s fine and you know the grass</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.409" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">is green the air is clean everything is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:02.730" style="s2">fine but in geological time this is just</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:04.800" style="s2">a small blip</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.730" end="00:02:06.660" style="s2">and when we look at the degradation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.800" end="00:02:08.040" style="s2">habitats we&#39;re in the middle of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.660" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">extinction event that we can&#39;t even see</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.040" end="00:02:12.210" style="s2">or comprehend we&#39;re losing more species</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">than can even determine that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.210" end="00:02:16.020" style="s2">and there&#39;s more species in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t identified than there</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.020" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">are that we&#39;ve identified by orders of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:23.010" style="s2">so as the ecosystems unravel and we read</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">benefit here from being a having a</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:29.610" style="s2">us and so I maybe Paul Stamets speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:31.830" style="s2">with one voice but I&#39;m a community of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.610" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">microbes unified together as an organism</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:41.580" style="s2">microbes around me and as we lose</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:44.100" style="s2">species in the ecosystem is like losing</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.580" end="00:02:45.990" style="s2">rivers an airplane at what point will we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.100" end="00:02:47.790" style="s2">have so much loss of biodiversity we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">have catastrophic failure and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.790" end="00:02:51.660" style="s2">we&#39;re right in the middle of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:54.030" style="s2">catastrophic failure emerging right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.660" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">people talk about tipping points and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.030" end="00:02:58.680" style="s2">concern that I think a lot of us who</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">have knowledge bases and our specialties</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.680" end="00:03:02.520" style="s2">that are now collaborating and sharing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">information is that this tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.520" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">is really moving us very very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:09.690" style="s2">towards a massive ecological failure and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">as we have failure of the food chains</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.690" end="00:03:16.709" style="s2">which fungi sustain as we have diseases</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">and poverty and terrorism then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.709" end="00:03:20.520" style="s2">immune system of the habitats is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:22.590" style="s2">impugned as well as the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2">living within it and disease vectors</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.590" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">will proliferate and there&#39;s one lesson</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">of nature is that if any organism</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">exceeds the carrying capacity of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:32.180" style="s2">ecosystem the ecosystem revolts against</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">it and we have extinction events so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.180" end="00:03:36.270" style="s2">are at the point right now that if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:38.250" style="s2">don&#39;t wake up and engage microorganisms</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.270" end="00:03:41.610" style="s2">as to our allies and intelligently work</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">with them then they will seek revenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.610" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">against us I think that&#39;s just the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">of the balance of nature and organisms</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">and 99% of all species and the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:51.330" style="s2">of life has plan have become an extinct</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:53.790" style="s2">so that&#39;s an extinction is a normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.330" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">consequence of life now we&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.790" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">of that perhaps more so than other</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.550" style="s2">organisms or debatably some people could</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.630" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">say we&#39;re not conscious of that but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.550" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">think we&#39;re very quickly moving on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:07.110" style="s2">slippery slope you know and so this is a</p>
