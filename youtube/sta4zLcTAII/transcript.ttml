<p begin="00:00:02.030" end="00:00:10.830" style="s2">So while you guys were gone, I went on Wikipedia<br />and looked up Osiris, because when I did the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.830" end="00:00:15.809" style="s2">research for this book it certainly wasn’t<br />possible to get access to that kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.809" end="00:00:20.940" style="s2">instantaneously. And the stories that are<br />laid out in there… there’s a thread that</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.940" end="00:00:24.950" style="s2">runs the stories that are laid out there,<br />that’s quite similar to the one I told you,</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.950" end="00:00:29.790" style="s2">but there’s all sorts of details that are<br />very radically different. And so, I don’t</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.790" end="00:00:34.510" style="s2">really know what to say about that. And you<br />know, part of the reason that people like</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.510" end="00:00:41.570" style="s2">Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung and… there<br />was an original anthropologist, an armchair</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.570" end="00:00:46.610" style="s2">anthropologist, who wrote a book called The<br />Golden Bough, whose name escapes me momentarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.610" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">[it’s Sir James George Frazer], but it was<br />one of the first attempts to do a cross-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:54.910" style="s2">categorisation of mythology, and to look for<br />underlying commonalities. Now the problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.910" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">is, you know I told you about Naomi Klein<br />going down to Argentina and looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:04.780" style="s2">factory through her particular lens. The problem<br />is that when you develop a lens and then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.780" end="00:01:09.250" style="s2">look at things through it, you may just see<br />what that lens heightens, you know, and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.250" end="00:01:14.390" style="s2">think that’s a criticism that could be leveled<br />against the sorts of things that I’m telling</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.390" end="00:01:18.890" style="s2">you about. You know, that I’ve cherry-picked<br />certain stories and interpreted them in certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.890" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">ways so that they fall coherently into a scheme<br />of thought. And so I’ll tell you some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:31.479" style="s2">the things that I do methodologically to protect<br />myself against that, insofar as that’s possible.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.479" end="00:01:39.799" style="s2">So there is this idea in psychology called<br />the multimethod-multitrait method of construct</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.799" end="00:01:46.869" style="s2">validation, which is, you know, a God-awful<br />agglomeration of jargon. But it actually means</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.869" end="00:01:53.090" style="s2">something. And it was the construction of<br />two psychologists back in the late 1950s,</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.090" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2">Cronbach and Meehl, who were interested in<br />what psychologists meant when they said something</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:05.350" style="s2">existed. Like say, anger. Is that a real thing?<br />Well what do you mean, ‘thing’? What is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.350" end="00:02:09.369" style="s2">it that you’re talking about? What is anger,<br />exactly? I don’t mean as ‘anger’, but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.369" end="00:02:15.159" style="s2">as an idea. What sort of idea is the idea<br />of anger or the idea of anxiety or the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.159" end="00:02:20.620" style="s2">of sadness? Or the idea of self-esteem or<br />self-competence or any of these things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:27.319" style="s2">psychologists talk about as if they’re realities.<br />Well, some realities are very tangible, right,</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.319" end="00:02:33.121" style="s2">and it’s somewhat easy to come to agreement<br />about the contours of their existence, and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.121" end="00:02:39.950" style="s2">the borders, but other things are way more<br />difficult than that. And so their idea was</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.950" end="00:02:44.409" style="s2">that if something actually existed, you should<br />be able to measure it multiple ways, using</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.409" end="00:02:51.010" style="s2">multiple techniques, and still get the same<br />answer. And so, your senses do that. You have</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.010" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2">five of them. And the reason you have five,<br />apparently, is because evolution has determined</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:03:00.990" style="s2">that if you only had four you’d die more<br />often. So it seems as if you have five separate</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.990" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">sources of information that all lead to the<br />same conclusion. You can be relatively certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:14.670" style="s2">that the conclusion’s that reached is real.<br />Well, the multimethod-multitrait method is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.670" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">an application of that idea to construct validation,<br />which is like… you could think of anger</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">as an idea, as a construct, it’s a terminological<br />issue. You just define it as a construct,</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:31.069" style="s2">a psychological construct. How do you know<br />if they’re real? Well the idea is it’s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.069" end="00:03:35.890" style="s2">very complicated. You have to measure them<br />in multiple ways. All the ways you measure</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.890" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">them have to give the same reading. Then you<br />have to show that that idea is the same in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">certain ways as other ideas that it’s related<br />to and different from other ideas that it’s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:54.920" style="s2">not related. So let me give an example. There’s<br />a construct: ‘neuroticism’. And you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.920" end="00:04:00.020" style="s2">say, well there’s another construct: ‘depression’.<br />Well then you might say, “well are those</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.020" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">separate or are they the same?” Well that’s<br />a tough one, because in many, many ways they’re</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">the same. Are they different in any important<br />ways? Well, the way you do that technically</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:18.350" style="s2">is you would measure neuroticism however you<br />were going to measure it. Maybe I’d have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.350" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">you tell me how neurotic you were using a<br />questionnaire, and then I’d have your friend</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">tell me and maybe your parent, so we’ve<br />got a pretty good triangulation on your neuroticism.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:32.690" style="s2">Then I have them do the same thing, all those<br />people do the same thing with regards to your</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.690" end="00:04:38.370" style="s2">levels of depression and anxiety. Then I’d<br />use both those measures to predict something</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">else, like how well your life goes in terms<br />of career over the next ten years. And if</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:51.030" style="s2">neuroticism predicted and depression predicted,<br />so they were correlated, then I’d think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">well there’s some relationship. Then I’d<br />look at them at the same time. If I predict</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">with neuroticism and then I add depression<br />to the mix, does that give me more predictive</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:10.750" style="s2">power. It’s sort of like does A = C or does<br />A + B = C? That’s all you’re asking in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.750" end="00:05:18.380" style="s2">a regression equation, roughly speaking. Well<br />if A = C is just as good as A + B = C, especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:24.190" style="s2">if the two things are also correlated (depression/anxiety<br />and neuroticism are going to be very highly</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.190" end="00:05:29.340" style="s2">correlated, like 0.7, something like that),<br />you might say well those are the same things.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.340" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">Just because they have different names, it’s<br />not helped. And part of it is, it’s a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:41.100" style="s2">conceptualisation of reality, it’s like,<br />is this categorisation structure good for</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.100" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">something?<br />Okay, so anyways, I’ll unpack all that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:50.440" style="s2">say, well part of my rules for determining<br />whether these things were useful or not was</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.440" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">to see if the ideas apply across multiple<br />levels of analysis. So that’s why I told</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">you about the conceptual, so that’s sort<br />of the cognitive psychology, and then the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:07.500" style="s2">neuropsychological, so there’s some input<br />of brain research. And then the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.500" end="00:06:12.849" style="s2">or mythological, and then the cross-cultural<br />and think well those all stack up in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.849" end="00:06:17.410" style="s2">way so that if you look between all of them<br />you can see a pattern. And it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.410" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">increasingly unlikely that that pattern would<br />be there across all of those levels at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:29.419" style="s2">same time. Now you could say well, you know<br />that depends on how good you are at weaving</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.419" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">a story. But at some point, encapsulating<br />that many phenomena and weaving a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:44.139" style="s2">story out of them if such a thing doesn’t<br />exist, it seems to me to become cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.139" end="00:06:50.669" style="s2">impossible. You just can’t do it unless<br />there’s actually something there. And of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.669" end="00:06:55.580" style="s2">course everything I tell you also is a simplification.<br />It has to be. Because you could spend your</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.580" end="00:06:59.690" style="s2">whole life investigating any of the things<br />we’re talking about and so what I’m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:06.380" style="s2">is I’ve extracted out the central issues<br />of these multiple levels of analysis and put</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.380" end="00:07:15.849" style="s2">together, each of them support all the others.<br />Anyways, who knows? You know, I don’t know,</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.849" end="00:07:21.190" style="s2">but so far so good. Okay so this is a cool<br />representation, I really like this one. This</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.190" end="00:07:27.800" style="s2">is called The Open Virgin. And it’s a 14th<br />or 13th century sculpture, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.800" end="00:07:31.811" style="s2">It’s made out of wood. And these things<br />were actually… this isn’t the only one</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.811" end="00:07:39.240" style="s2">of them. They were a form of religious interpretation<br />that had different exemplars. You could find</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:44.910" style="s2">different ones of them online. This is brilliant,<br />this bloody thing, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.910" end="00:07:52.349" style="s2">So let me show you this figure again. So basically<br />what you have here, in this figure, this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.349" end="00:07:58.069" style="s2">a world conception. And the world conception<br />is roughly: there’s an individual, positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.069" end="00:08:05.240" style="s2">and negative, he or she is in a cultural sphere<br />that’s positive or negative, that’s embedded</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.240" end="00:08:09.570" style="s2">in the world outside of culture, that’s<br />positive and negative, and all of it comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.570" end="00:08:18.090" style="s2">from potential. That’s the idea.<br />Now, this map shows all of the positives and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.090" end="00:08:22.210" style="s2">negatives in relationship to one another,<br />and you see it’s not perfectly symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.210" end="00:08:27.449" style="s2">and the reason for that is, as far as I can<br />tell, the adversarial element of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.449" end="00:08:32.920" style="s2">is the thing that generates the tyrannical<br />element of culture. And that’s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.920" end="00:08:41.940" style="s2">that gets in your way of establishing a creative<br />relationship with what you don’t know. Well,</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.940" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">anyways. Here is a manifestation of that,<br />I believe. And I like this manifestation because…</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:58.690" style="s2">like, it’s obviously Christian, but not<br />exactly. It’s more mythological than Christian.</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.690" end="00:09:08.140" style="s2">And the reason for that, well, is quite obvious.<br />So the superordinate figure is Mary, the feminine.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.140" end="00:09:12.650" style="s2">Now you think, well it’s amazing the person<br />who carved this didn’t get burnt up at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.650" end="00:09:18.830" style="s2">Inquisition, because it’s a radical idea,<br />but it’s just an indication of how the mythology</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.830" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">can change the causal relationship between<br />these different elements.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:29.670" style="s2">So you have Mary there, she’s the ultimate<br />in femininity, the ultimate feminine deity,</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.670" end="00:09:37.660" style="s2">but only the positive side. And then within<br />her, so it’s like Nature opens itself up,</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.660" end="00:09:43.610" style="s2">benevolent Nature opens itself up, and what<br />you see inside is culture, that’s God the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.610" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">Father, holding the individual, and the individual<br />in this case is the crucified Christ, which</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:54.410" style="s2">is a wonderful conceptualisation as far as<br />I’m concerned, because of course that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.410" end="00:10:00.060" style="s2">what life does to people, that’s why that’s<br />such a powerful symbol. It’s like, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.060" end="00:10:06.520" style="s2">Christ is the person who has to face the reality<br />of his own death, voluntarily or involuntarily,</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.520" end="00:10:13.260" style="s2">who’s betrayed by his culture, betrayed<br />by his friends, it’s sort of like he’s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.260" end="00:10:21.540" style="s2">exposed to the most torturous elements of<br />individual being. And simultaneously, at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.540" end="00:10:24.630" style="s2">in principle, transcends them. Well it’s<br />like you bloody well better do that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.630" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">otherwise, well what’s going to happen?<br />You’re done if you don’t do that. And</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:35.260" style="s2">it’s even worse, it’s not only that you<br />fail, that’s just the beginning of it. If</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.260" end="00:10:41.380" style="s2">you can’t transcend the tragedy of your<br />being then you get corrupted. I see this happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.380" end="00:10:48.150" style="s2">to people happening all the time.<br />So you know, if you’re suffering and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.150" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">can’t cope with it, generally speaking what<br />happens is that it embitters you. And once</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:01.900" style="s2">you get bitter you get resentful, and once<br />you get resentful you look for revenge. And</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.900" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2">that can just get completely out of hand.<br />Now that’s a quick trip to the worst suburb</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">of the Underworld, that’s for sure. So you<br />know, it’s not only that if you don’t</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:19.810" style="s2">manage this transcendent act that you’re<br />swamped by the tragedy of your life. You’re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.810" end="00:11:24.600" style="s2">swamped by the tragedy of your life, and then<br />that corrupts you, and then you start working</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.600" end="00:11:30.960" style="s2">to make everything even more tragic than it<br />has to be. And so I think that’s why in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.960" end="00:11:38.920" style="s2">medieval Christian conceptualisations in particular,<br />the idea of hell, the idea that you were destined</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.920" end="00:11:43.381" style="s2">to hell was worse than the idea of dying.<br />And it’s a strange idea, you know, because</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.381" end="00:11:47.330" style="s2">you think (this is what the terror management<br />theorists think too) is that “there’s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.330" end="00:11:50.960" style="s2">nothing worse than the fear of death!” It’s<br />like, that’s wrong. They don’t have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.960" end="00:11:58.390" style="s2">right imagination. There are lots of things<br />that are worse than the fear of death. I’m</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.390" end="00:12:05.520" style="s2">not trying to trivialise the fear of death,<br />obviously, but I don’t think it’s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.520" end="00:12:10.890" style="s2">difficult to understand that there are some<br />things that you would rather die than do.</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.890" end="00:12:16.440" style="s2">I mean I’m sure that I could get you guys<br />to sit for fifteen minutes and say okay, list</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.440" end="00:12:22.250" style="s2">ten things that you would rather die than<br />do. That’s easy. Especially if you’re</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.250" end="00:12:25.930" style="s2">a parent. You can think of those things in<br />like no time flat.</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.930" end="00:12:30.930" style="s2">Okay so that’s pretty interesting. So you’ve<br />got the superordinate feminine figure here,</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.930" end="00:12:34.830" style="s2">which is not what you would expect from a<br />Christian representation, right? You’d expect</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.830" end="00:12:38.750" style="s2">God to be on the outside, and then Mary and<br />then Christ, in all likelihood, although that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.750" end="00:12:45.300" style="s2">would also be a valid representation. Because<br />you can think of the mother as something that’s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.300" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">protected by the culture. And supporting the<br />individual, because that’s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:56.340" style="s2">this representation shows. But then you see<br />on the open sides, I really like this, I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.340" end="00:13:01.270" style="s2">it’s so cool, is that you’ve got all these<br />people who aren’t archetypal figures, they’re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.270" end="00:13:06.210" style="s2">in a little crowd. And they’re gazing at<br />the central figure. And of course that’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.210" end="00:13:09.620" style="s2">exactly what’s happened in Christianity<br />for two thousand years, right, insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.620" end="00:13:14.210" style="s2">it has spread, is that for two thousand years<br />people have been looking at that image, which</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.210" end="00:13:23.290" style="s2">is the crucifixion, transfixed by it. Well<br />why? Well, you know, for reasons that we don’t</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.290" end="00:13:29.410" style="s2">understand. When everybody woke up in the<br />late 1800s and said, “why were we looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.410" end="00:13:34.060" style="s2">at that for the last two thousand years?”<br />the first answer was “well we really don’t</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.060" end="00:13:39.740" style="s2">have the foggiest idea”. It was just one<br />of the things that we did, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.740" end="00:13:45.390" style="s2">It encapsulated people within the belief system.<br />So that’s another good example, anyway,</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.390" end="00:13:50.420" style="s2">of how this archetypal imagery can manifest<br />itself, say spontaneously, in the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.420" end="00:13:57.870" style="s2">of an artist. And the thing is, that’s a<br />sacred image. And it is an actuality, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.870" end="00:14:04.920" style="s2">what it is. What it shows is, well there’s<br />a superordinate, transcendent, natural order</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.920" end="00:14:09.540" style="s2">that has a beneficial element that we associate<br />with femininity, and inside that there’s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.540" end="00:14:14.621" style="s2">a supportive culture that’s properly nested<br />if things are organised properly. And it’s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.621" end="00:14:19.520" style="s2">both of those things that provide support<br />for the suffering individuals. It’s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.520" end="00:14:26.290" style="s2">yeah, that’s pretty much got it. Now that<br />doesn’t exhaust the meaning of this particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.290" end="00:14:32.370" style="s2">representation, there’s a lot more to it<br />than that, but just that is not so bad.</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.370" end="00:14:38.120" style="s2">And then, you know I can show you a more negative<br />representation, I think I’ve shown you this</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.120" end="00:14:44.990" style="s2">before. Like this would be a representation<br />of the negative element of the feminine. And</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.990" end="00:14:51.880" style="s2">so you have Kali here, and Kali is the goddess<br />to whom you make sacrifices and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.880" end="00:14:57.320" style="s2">if you make the right sacrifices, then Kali<br />turns into her positive counterpart. And you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.320" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">know, you think, well that’s a… what…<br />how does sacrifice affect your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:07.260" style="s2">with the gods? Well first of all there’s<br />no gods and second of all, well then what</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.260" end="00:15:11.960" style="s2">the hell are you doing with the sacrifices?<br />But it’s pretty straightforward. We’ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.960" end="00:15:17.850" style="s2">already talked about this at length. You do<br />make sacrifices, all the time. And what that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.850" end="00:15:24.420" style="s2">means is that you act as if you can have a<br />relationship with being. You assume that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.420" end="00:15:29.890" style="s2">you withhold certain things from yourself<br />now, that you will improve your relationship,</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.890" end="00:15:35.250" style="s2">both with nature and with culture. And I already<br />told you guys that as far as I was concerned</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.250" end="00:15:42.040" style="s2">that was the most stunning cognitive discovery<br />of mankind. It’s the discovery of the future.</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.040" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">And it’s the discovery of the relationship<br />between the present and the future. You know</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:50.762" style="s2">it’s such an amazing idea, that you can<br />alter your behaviour now, and it’ll pay</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.762" end="00:15:56.860" style="s2">off in a year. God, that’s not obvious.<br />It’s certainly not… animals don’t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.860" end="00:16:01.520" style="s2">that way. You know, some of them act that<br />way, like bees and so on, but that’s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.520" end="00:16:05.240" style="s2">built right into their behaviour, as far as<br />we can tell.</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.240" end="00:16:11.910" style="s2">So anyway, so there’s Kali. And you know,<br />she’s a spider. She’s in a web of fire.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.910" end="00:16:18.120" style="s2">The fire is outside a web that’s made out<br />of skulls. She’s got weapons in her hand,</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.120" end="00:16:22.610" style="s2">her hair is on fire. She’s got a headdress<br />of skulls. I mean, if you ever saw something</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.610" end="00:16:25.800" style="s2">like that it would traumatise you so badly<br />you wouldn’t be able to get out of your</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.800" end="00:16:30.790" style="s2">house for like five years. That’s exactly<br />what it is. That’s what it is. It’s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.790" end="00:16:37.430" style="s2">representation of all of that that would traumatise<br />you if you encountered it. And you know, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.430" end="00:16:41.610" style="s2">an attempt to encapsulate that as an image,<br />and what you could say, in some sense, is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.610" end="00:16:47.500" style="s2">that the people who developed this image were<br />attempting to conceptualise the class of all</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.500" end="00:16:53.200" style="s2">terrifying things. And once you get the class<br />of all terrifying things conceptualised, you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.200" end="00:16:58.330" style="s2">could come up with the class of all useful<br />responses. And that would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.330" end="00:17:05.200" style="s2">the proper way to behave, and sacrifice is<br />an integral element of that. It’s like yeah,</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.200" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">absolutely. Absolutely dead on. Unless you<br />don’t believe that sacrifice works, in which</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:15.160" style="s2">case, what the hell are you doing here? I<br />mean, you know, you act out your belief. And</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.160" end="00:17:20.440" style="s2">it’s a firm belief. And you would also say<br />that if things fell apart so badly that sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.440" end="00:17:26.020" style="s2">no longer paid off, your life would basically<br />become intolerable. Because it would mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.020" end="00:17:31.940" style="s2">that you would have abandoned all sense of<br />control over the outcomes of your actions.</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.940" end="00:17:40.050" style="s2">Well you can’t live like that, you’d just<br />die of stress. Well and as I said, she was</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.050" end="00:17:44.440" style="s2">pregnant, she’s given birth to this unfortunate<br />character, who she’s devouring intestines</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.440" end="00:17:50.250" style="s2">first. Like it’s a rough image. It’s an<br />image of the destructive element of nature.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.250" end="00:17:55.750" style="s2">And so that’s the negative side of the feminine,<br />we might say.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.750" end="00:18:09.450" style="s2">There’s a positive representation. This<br />is a Greek representation. That’s Diana,</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.450" end="00:18:18.270" style="s2">or Artemis. I’m hoping I’m remembering<br />this properly. She’s multi-breasted. This</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.270" end="00:18:26.820" style="s2">circle around her head is undoubtedly a representation<br />of her cosmic nature. So it’s like a halo</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.820" end="00:18:34.430" style="s2">but the halo is basically a planetary body<br />like the Sun… a cosmic body like the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.430" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">or the Moon behind the head of the divine<br />individual with all of that power shining</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">forward. So it’s an attempt to use… you<br />know, if you look up at the Moon or you look</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">up at the Sun, there’s an element that’s<br />characterised by awe. You can’t help but</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:54.820" style="s2">feel that, at least its beauty and power,<br />and sometimes it’s overwhelming. Well, you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.820" end="00:19:00.340" style="s2">take the representation of the personality<br />and you throw the representation of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.340" end="00:19:07.030" style="s2">cosmic powers behind it, and it’s an attempt<br />to represent transcendent value. It’s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.030" end="00:19:12.290" style="s2">intelligent. It’s brilliant, in fact. And<br />so partly what you’re trying to do as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.290" end="00:19:17.620" style="s2">conduct your life is you’re trying to get<br />all of these archetypal forces in proper balance.</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.620" end="00:19:24.610" style="s2">And I suppose in some sense to get them tilted<br />towards the good, if that’s possible. I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.610" end="00:19:38.210" style="s2">mean, that’s what this representation in<br />some sense, you might say… [looks for picture]…</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.210" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">yeah, you might say well if you got everything<br />ordered properly, this is what being would</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:53.170" style="s2">be like. Still pretty rough, given that the<br />crucifix is at its centre.</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.170" end="00:19:59.620" style="s2">Now I don’t know, you know, if you think<br />about it from a purely technical perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.620" end="00:20:04.990" style="s2">roughly speaking, each of these archetypes<br />is split into positive and negative. You might</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.990" end="00:20:12.870" style="s2">say, well, that’s just how it is. There<br />is no way that you can interact with all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.870" end="00:20:21.220" style="s2">them so that the whole system tilts towards<br />the positive, you know. But I don’t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.220" end="00:20:26.020" style="s2">that’s true. I think you can get them lined<br />up so that things tilt towards the positive.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.020" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">And I think you can detect when that happens,<br />because those are the periods in your life</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">where you feel that you’re richly enough<br />engaged in what you’re doing and life is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:42.280" style="s2">meaningful enough, so that the rest of it,<br />the substructure that makes it necessary,</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.280" end="00:20:48.050" style="s2">is worth it. It’s worthwhile, you know,<br />that the negative exists is okay given the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.050" end="00:20:53.820" style="s2">way that things are structured.<br />Now I think that whether or not that’s true</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.820" end="00:21:02.620" style="s2">is in some sense the eternal question of mankind.<br />Can you organise your life so that it’s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.620" end="00:21:09.660" style="s2">good? Well, it seems like you can certainly<br />allow your life to degenerate so that it’s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.660" end="00:21:13.430" style="s2">terrible. That seems indisputable, right,<br />and there does seem to be an element of choice</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.430" end="00:21:19.850" style="s2">in that, although, you know something terrible<br />can happen to you that you have no choice</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.850" end="00:21:25.300" style="s2">of or control over. But it certainly seems<br />that you could do any number of stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.300" end="00:21:30.060" style="s2">blind things that make everything worse. I<br />think that’s common experience. And I also</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.060" end="00:21:35.160" style="s2">think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone<br />who wouldn’t say that there were things</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.160" end="00:21:41.131" style="s2">they did consciously and willingly, that were<br />of their own choice, that they didn’t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.131" end="00:21:48.150" style="s2">to do, that made things worse. So we seem<br />to have some sense of our moral agency. And</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.150" end="00:21:53.480" style="s2">we seem automatically to accept some responsibility<br />for the outcomes of our actions. And so partly</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.480" end="00:21:57.650" style="s2">what that means is that we do believe that<br />we can make things better or worse. And I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:02.820" style="s2">suppose in some way that means that we believe<br />we can tap the whole archetypal structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:16.910" style="s2">of being into the positive. Well I would say<br />if you drill down to the bottom of existentialism,</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.910" end="00:22:21.670" style="s2">in some sense, that’s the question that<br />the existentialists pose, you know. Is there</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.670" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">a manner of conducting your life such that<br />it becomes… it’s not merely acceptable,</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:35.930" style="s2">it’s more than that. You’d say yes, this<br />is how it should be.</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.930" end="00:22:39.670" style="s2">What we’re going to do now, although we’re<br />not going to do it today, is we’re going</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.670" end="00:22:45.020" style="s2">to start talking about other representations<br />of this sub-structure from other religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.020" end="00:22:50.390" style="s2">traditions. And we’re going to also talk<br />about ways that you might relate to these</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.390" end="00:22:56.200" style="s2">figures. Because one question might be, well<br />you’re part of your culture, and it’s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.200" end="00:23:01.630" style="s2">got an orderly element, and a protective element,<br />and a tyrannical element. Okay so what should</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.630" end="00:23:08.530" style="s2">you do about that? You know, should you…<br />the tyrannical element is real and it’s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.530" end="00:23:12.840" style="s2">corrupt and blind, and so to the degree that<br />you identify with that, when you’re tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.840" end="00:23:17.880" style="s2">and corrupt and blind, but by the same token<br />you’re the fortunate beneficiary of tens</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.880" end="00:23:25.330" style="s2">of thousands of years of cultural and technological<br />evolution and effort. And it seems to me that,</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.330" end="00:23:30.521" style="s2">you know, you should be at least appropriately<br />grateful for that. And so then you’re in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.521" end="00:23:35.530" style="s2">a real position, because you have to be grateful<br />and happy for the thing that tyrannises and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.530" end="00:23:40.900" style="s2">controls you. Well, okay, that’s not an<br />easy thing to figure out, because those things</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.900" end="00:23:47.770" style="s2">seem to conflict. So what exactly should your<br />relationship to culture be? Well, I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.770" end="00:23:54.830" style="s2">there are myths that describe that quite directly.<br />And they take into account the corruption.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.830" end="00:24:02.440" style="s2">It’s not a whitewash. It’s like yes of<br />course this thing is dead and blind and corrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.440" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">Obviously. And you know, it’s foolishness<br />and wilfulness… it’s ignorance and wilful</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:15.690" style="s2">blindness that make it that way, as well as<br />things merely getting old and falling apart.</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.690" end="00:24:19.740" style="s2">So the fact that there’s some malevolence<br />at the bottom of it is also true. Should you</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.740" end="00:24:27.020" style="s2">flee from that? Well, that isn’t what the<br />myths say. They say what you’re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.020" end="00:24:31.460" style="s2">to do is, just like Pinocchio, you’re supposed<br />to go to the bottom of the ocean, to the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.460" end="00:24:36.890" style="s2">monstrous possible part, and rescue your father.<br />That’s what you have to do before you become</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.890" end="00:24:44.410" style="s2">an individual.<br />And I can’t see how that can’t be right.</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.410" end="00:24:50.040" style="s2">In fact, I think that’s what you’re doing<br />in university, if you’re actually getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.040" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">a university education. What you’re here<br />to do is sift through the dead remnants of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:25:01.770" style="s2">the past and pull up what’s vital, that’s<br />so sophisticated and complex that there’s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.770" end="00:25:05.570" style="s2">no way that you’d be able to think it up<br />for yourself. But you know, it requires you</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.570" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">as the discriminating agent. You know, if<br />you read someone like Nietzsche or you read</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">someone like Freud, there’s lots to throw<br />away. It isn’t what you throw away though,</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.960" end="00:25:20.570" style="s2">it’s what you keep that matters. And to<br />be a discriminating reader means that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.570" end="00:25:26.260" style="s2">get rid of the dead matter and you keep the<br />gold. And you build yourself up a storehouse</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:34.440" style="s2">of gold, and then you can live in the world.<br />And people often ask, what’s the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.440" end="00:25:40.270" style="s2">of getting a degree in the humanities? Well<br />the answer to that is that if you’re properly</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.270" end="00:25:47.309" style="s2">trained in the humanities, you know how to<br />live. Now that’s the same as having a job,</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.309" end="00:25:53.040" style="s2">and you need to have a job. But you know,<br />knowing how to live is a more important thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.040" end="00:25:58.890" style="s2">than having a job, even though having a job<br />is an important thing. And the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.890" end="00:26:04.770" style="s2">that is that if you don’t know how to live<br />then things fall apart. And that’s not good.</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.770" end="00:26:09.930" style="s2">And they can really fall apart, you know,<br />and part of the reason I think that this became</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.930" end="00:26:17.290" style="s2">so much of an obsession for me is that I believe<br />that we don’t have a lottery of… we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.290" end="00:26:29.300" style="s2">narrowing… we’ve become so powerful that<br />the consequence of our blindness is reaching</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.300" end="00:26:33.890" style="s2">uncontrollable proportions. If you’re weak<br />and stupid, well you know, there’s only</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.890" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">so much damage you can do. But we’re not<br />weak, not at all. We have unbelievable power</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:46.050" style="s2">at our disposal now, and a lot of weird things<br />are going to come down the pipes in the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.050" end="00:26:52.070" style="s2">ten years.<br />The more people that have their act together,</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.070" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">the better. Because then things will be tilted<br />towards everything lining up in a positive</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:05.531" style="s2">direction rather than being tilted in the<br />other direction. And that’s important. And</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.531" end="00:27:10.770" style="s2">I think people can make a very powerful individual<br />contribution to that, wherever you happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.770" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">to be. You know, all of these myths always<br />say the same thing. They say that the future</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:31.160" style="s2">of the world depends on individual choice.<br />And I think that’s literally true. So then</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.160" end="00:27:35.090" style="s2">you might think, well you better put yourself<br />in a position where you make wise choices,</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.090" end="00:27:43.240" style="s2">because if you don’t… we’ve already<br />seen what happens. We got a taste in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.240" end="00:27:51.890" style="s2">century. So, if you want some more of that,<br />you could certainly have it.</p>
