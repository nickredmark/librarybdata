<p begin="00:00:53.460" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">stages apply to an enormous number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:00.630" style="s2">different skills and so you can have</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">dozens of different names for these</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.630" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">stages and it can get confusing so one</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:06.619" style="s2">of the things we do is just give them</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">different colors so the previous</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.619" end="00:01:12.569" style="s2">ethnocentric stage we call amber and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:16.219" style="s2">this orange rational world centric</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.569" end="00:01:21.499" style="s2">universal care stage we call orange</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.219" end="00:01:24.689" style="s2">those two stages</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.569" end="00:01:39.770" style="s2">to arise again during the Western</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.770" end="00:01:45.179" style="s2">world centric development ended to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.779" end="00:01:49.340" style="s2">emerge and that&#39;s what we call green or</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.179" end="00:01:53.029" style="s2">it was multicultural so it wasn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.340" end="00:01:57.149" style="s2">belief in individuality and its freedom</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.029" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different opinions</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:05.069" style="s2">about post-modernism on the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">dark grip in general nobody likes it my</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.069" end="00:02:11.329" style="s2">point some things we talked about they</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:14.220" style="s2">said a lot of it really is off-the-wall</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.329" end="00:02:16.740" style="s2">extreme if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.220" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">bad have you you want to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.740" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">but they it also had a core of some true</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">if they&#39;re partial notions and those</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">truths are initially what actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">helped to drive that stage of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:35.820" style="s2">development and it did start to call</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">itself postmodern because it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.820" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">reflecting on the previous modern stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">of orange liberal rationale Universal</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:48.240" style="s2">care individual liberty freedom freedom</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:51.770" style="s2">of speech it reflected on all of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.240" end="00:02:54.840" style="s2">intended to have sort of a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.770" end="00:02:57.300" style="s2">those but it&#39;s still having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.840" end="00:03:01.550" style="s2">finding ways to actually integrate them</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.300" end="00:03:04.710" style="s2">and so it tends to take a stance that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.550" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">believes in radical egalitarianism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.710" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">so it&#39;s version of equality is unlike</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">the previous orange version of equality</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">oranges version is liberty and freedom</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">of opportunity for green and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:29.300" style="s2">egalitarianism it wants equal outcome</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">and this becomes enormous lee</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.300" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">conflictual is there there too they</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:38.420" style="s2">don&#39;t get along well at all for starters</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:41.580" style="s2">and given the fact that the original</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.420" end="00:03:45.930" style="s2">orange equality actually meant freedom</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.580" end="00:03:47.700" style="s2">of opportunity oranges version of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.930" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">equality was also often just called</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.700" end="00:03:54.390" style="s2">freedom it was in favor of the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">of individuals whereas greens version of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.390" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">equality equal outcome and so it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:07.080" style="s2">just be called equality or equity and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">you had freedom and equality and Alex de</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">Tocqueville was one of the first to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.800" style="s2">point out that because human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">born with different capacities and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.800" end="00:04:18.060" style="s2">can have either freedom or equality but</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t have both</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.060" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly right you you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:25.640" style="s2">almost frame this as the division</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">between classical liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.640" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">post-modernism that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:32.590" style="s2">by the intellectual dark Weber really</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:35.379" style="s2">fighting hard on behalf of classical</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.590" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2">liberalism that&#39;s exactly right and one</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.379" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">of the things that happen as you go back</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.300" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">and look at this original right and left</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">distinction and again there there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:50.020" style="s2">several ways that those can be defined</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:51.729" style="s2">but one of the ways that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.020" end="00:04:55.629" style="s2">defined does have to do with these</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.729" end="00:04:57.159" style="s2">stages of development I mean I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.629" end="00:04:59.020" style="s2">just agreeing with the other ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.159" end="00:05:00.940" style="s2">Jonathan hight has a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.020" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">description of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.940" end="00:05:06.340" style="s2">Jordan Peterson gives at least two</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">definitions of left and right one based</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.340" end="00:05:13.180" style="s2">on big factor analysis progressives tend</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">to be more open and conservatives tend</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.180" end="00:05:21.129" style="s2">to be more conscientious particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">suborder a subset subtype order and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.129" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">also seized a hierarchies of competence</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:31.090" style="s2">as necessary and so the right tends to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:33.190" style="s2">support those but any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.090" end="00:05:36.219" style="s2">hierarchies tend to generate inequality</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.190" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">and so the left hates that and tries to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.219" end="00:05:41.740" style="s2">tear those down so you need both of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:45.610" style="s2">those interacting I agree with all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.740" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">that there&#39;s also a factor that you see</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:49.779" style="s2">left and right as you track these stages</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.409" style="s2">of development and particularly going</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.779" end="00:05:57.729" style="s2">from the original amber ethno Center</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.409" end="00:06:02.110" style="s2">into orange freedom world center into</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.729" end="00:06:04.289" style="s2">green equality world center and so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.110" end="00:06:07.599" style="s2">started out we had the original</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.289" end="00:06:11.770" style="s2">traditional right tends to be a snow</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.599" end="00:06:14.110" style="s2">centric and again it can be a bit racist</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:17.500" style="s2">and a bit sexist and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.110" end="00:06:20.110" style="s2">embarrassed about those it&#39;s fine with</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.500" end="00:06:25.330" style="s2">that it thinks that&#39;s the way it should</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.110" end="00:06:29.229" style="s2">be and then you have orange which was</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.330" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">the original liberal philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.229" end="00:06:38.380" style="s2">individual rights and rights for all</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:40.060" style="s2">universal individual rights and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.380" end="00:06:41.569" style="s2">really was profound that got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.060" end="00:06:43.939" style="s2">slavery that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.569" end="00:06:47.029" style="s2">enormous number of changes that happened</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.939" end="00:06:49.509" style="s2">with that and then we moved up to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.029" end="00:06:53.379" style="s2">green multicultural which was really</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.509" end="00:06:56.059" style="s2">toast liberal in many cases became</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.379" end="00:06:59.029" style="s2">anti-liberal it doesn&#39;t really like free</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.059" end="00:06:59.779" style="s2">speech it doesn&#39;t really like individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.029" end="00:07:02.659" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.779" end="00:07:06.289" style="s2">it wants group rights group identity</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.659" end="00:07:09.529" style="s2">it&#39;s very willing to curtail free speech</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.289" end="00:07:13.069" style="s2">or even on the other hand compel free</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.529" end="00:07:16.669" style="s2">speech in order to serve social justice</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.069" end="00:07:19.669" style="s2">ends and that infuriates an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.669" end="00:07:22.999" style="s2">number of people on on the dark ribbon</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.669" end="00:07:27.469" style="s2">and I think rightly rightly so so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.999" end="00:07:31.639" style="s2">started to happen is that as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.469" end="00:07:35.689" style="s2">original left which started this orange</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.639" end="00:07:37.249" style="s2">individual equal opportunity as I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.689" end="00:07:39.439" style="s2">know exactly how many of them but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.249" end="00:07:41.689" style="s2">gonna say half about half of them as</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.439" end="00:07:44.929" style="s2">progressive bumped up to the new green</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.689" end="00:07:49.249" style="s2">starting in the sixties the other half</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.929" end="00:07:52.459" style="s2">stayed for the original liberal left</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.249" end="00:07:56.330" style="s2">values but now I had an old left and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.459" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">new left the right essentially given</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.330" end="00:08:01.279" style="s2">this new stage that had been added it</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:03.860" style="s2">bumped up a stage two or half of it did</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.279" end="00:08:07.369" style="s2">so the old original right stated</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:12.469" style="s2">ethnocentric including energy streams</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.279" end="00:12:01.449" style="s2">you can start to regress to the actual</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.820" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">problem with that is that it is</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.360" end="00:12:40.149" style="s2">stance if when you talk about your tribe</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.149" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">differences there are you also talk</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.980" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">with that but if you just talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.120" end="00:12:59.709" style="s2">your tribe and how it&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:02.130" style="s2">all the other tribes and is there some</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.709" end="00:13:05.560" style="s2">sort of special attention is gas</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:41.320" style="s2">depends in a sense on what community you</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.650" end="00:17:27.850" style="s2">and then his left started to move into</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.610" end="00:19:56.890" style="s2">and working out of the stage trying to</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.890" end="00:20:01.930" style="s2">you start to open yourself to new</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.380" end="00:20:02.290" style="s2">approaches and because we all have these</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.080" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">right now and and one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.810" end="00:20:22.270" style="s2">think that the intellectual dark web has</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:26.530" style="s2">particularly arisen at this time is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.270" end="00:20:30.070" style="s2">we really did have the emergence of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.530" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">new stage of development and it really</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.070" end="00:20:38.290" style="s2">is radically relativistic radically</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:42.160" style="s2">egalitarian prison great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.290" end="00:20:45.610" style="s2">emphasis on equal outcome and she&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.160" end="00:20:49.510" style="s2">differences at all as the product of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.610" end="00:20:52.660" style="s2">oppression or discrimination and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.510" end="00:20:55.090" style="s2">what so many of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.660" end="00:21:00.010" style="s2">web people are fighting against they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.090" end="00:21:02.680" style="s2">not saying okay well they&#39;re saying look</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.010" end="00:21:05.830" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s possible that some of that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.680" end="00:21:08.560" style="s2">oppression no doubt but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.830" end="00:21:10.690" style="s2">other reasons that we see these</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.560" end="00:21:12.940" style="s2">differences and they might have to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.690" end="00:21:17.140" style="s2">with different interests in male and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.940" end="00:21:22.840" style="s2">female for example nobody is holding</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.140" end="00:21:24.010" style="s2">that as a absolutist ik view but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.840" end="00:21:29.830" style="s2">view that they&#39;re not going to rule out</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.010" end="00:21:33.850" style="s2">and you start to see this in a enormous</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.830" end="00:21:37.330" style="s2">number of important areas in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.850" end="00:21:39.400" style="s2">just how man on average and women on</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.230" end="00:21:45.670" style="s2">interesting there&#39;s no evidence they</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.490" end="00:21:57.610" style="s2">important in life and they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.530" end="00:22:00.790" style="s2">pursue those and part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.610" end="00:22:06.040" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been answered well with the</p>

<p begin="00:25:12.779" end="00:25:19.730" style="s2">will argue these points and moderated by</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.730" end="00:25:25.529" style="s2">somebody like that and thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:25:25.529" end="00:25:32.759" style="s2">they last two and three hours people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.450" end="00:25:35.999" style="s2">enormous ly interested in these topics</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.759" end="00:25:37.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s so important about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.999" end="00:25:41.789" style="s2">fact that they are coming together on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.799" end="00:25:45.149" style="s2">place that this almost happened nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.789" end="00:25:49.259" style="s2">else but the net that does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.149" end="00:25:52.710" style="s2">one of the ways the net is now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.259" end="00:25:54.659" style="s2">overcoming how it got derailed a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.710" end="00:25:57.269" style="s2">when it started</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.659" end="00:26:00.389" style="s2">you know decade or two ago everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.269" end="00:26:03.059" style="s2">particularly the boomers would say oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.389" end="00:26:05.070" style="s2">this is going to be a global brain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.059" end="00:26:07.169" style="s2">going to unite all humanity it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.070" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">to be the single greatest unifying force</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.169" end="00:26:12.210" style="s2">in the history of the world and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:14.970" style="s2">about 15 decades later it&#39;s the single</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.210" end="00:26:16.529" style="s2">most polarizing thing that happened it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.970" end="00:26:18.570" style="s2">just turns out that how you can search</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.529" end="00:26:21.149" style="s2">data means you can search for those</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.570" end="00:26:22.649" style="s2">things it&#39;s just you agree with and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.149" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">you end up talking there and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.649" end="00:26:27.119" style="s2">end up in the circle echo chambers and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:30.330" style="s2">the polarization gets greater and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.119" end="00:26:31.950" style="s2">greater and greater and then it&#39;s added</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.330" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">to you by the so-called Mardi Gras</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.950" end="00:26:37.350" style="s2">effect in Mardi Gras when you&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.620" style="s2">a mask and people can&#39;t see you you tend</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.350" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">to do a lot nastier</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.620" end="00:26:42.520" style="s2">things than if they could actually see</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:45.190" style="s2">who you are because you have a you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.520" end="00:26:47.500" style="s2">a mask well that&#39;s what social media is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.190" end="00:26:49.960" style="s2">like you can mask yourself and be</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.500" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">anything anything you want so it</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.960" end="00:26:54.790" style="s2">encourages you to come uh it&#39;s a race to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">the bottom in other words is a race to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.790" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2">the to the not not our better angels but</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:03.220" style="s2">our worse Devils and those those tend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.000" end="00:27:05.110" style="s2">come out so now what we&#39;re seeing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.220" end="00:27:07.590" style="s2">dark webs a little bit of an overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.110" end="00:27:10.780" style="s2">of that we&#39;re starting to find ways of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.590" end="00:27:13.620" style="s2">building these holes do you think this</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.780" end="00:27:16.750" style="s2">polarization is an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.620" end="00:27:20.850" style="s2">yeah and certainly so what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.750" end="00:27:25.090" style="s2">about it certainly in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.850" end="00:27:30.420" style="s2">degree of extremism of poet polarization</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.090" end="00:27:35.460" style="s2">I think Jonathan Hite did a study</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.420" end="00:27:39.429" style="s2">looking at polarization among typically</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.460" end="00:27:44.260" style="s2">polarized groups so he came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.429" end="00:27:46.090" style="s2">series of measurements that measured the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.260" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">degree of polarization between groups</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.090" end="00:27:53.350" style="s2">like male and female wealthy and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:55.900" style="s2">disadvantaged black in white you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.350" end="00:27:56.260" style="s2">educated uneducated all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.900" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.260" end="00:28:01.690" style="s2">and he has some sort of arbitrary scale</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:05.710" style="s2">that was something like around the 0 to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.690" end="00:28:07.990" style="s2">20 where 20 was most polarized and 0 was</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.710" end="00:28:11.559" style="s2">at least polarized and so he found</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.990" end="00:28:16.270" style="s2">things like male and female and rich and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.559" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">poor educated uneducated and so on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.270" end="00:28:24.100" style="s2">degree of polarization went up to about</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:26.590" style="s2">10 points of separation and then there</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.100" end="00:28:31.030" style="s2">is a huge leap all the way up to left</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.590" end="00:28:33.750" style="s2">and right and that was 18 points I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.030" end="00:28:36.429" style="s2">it was just that was off-the-wall</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.750" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">polarized and what was even more</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.429" end="00:28:43.960" style="s2">disturbing is that if you&#39;d looked at</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:46.660" style="s2">left and right say 50 years ago and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.960" end="00:28:47.740" style="s2">had polls saying what do you whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.660" end="00:28:50.350" style="s2">your left or right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.740" end="00:28:52.360" style="s2">think about your opponents left to right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.350" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">and and typical</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.360" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">answer would be things like I really do</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.000" end="00:28:59.710" style="s2">disagree with them I think their hearts</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:01.960" style="s2">in the right place but I I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.710" end="00:29:05.580" style="s2">agree with what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.960" end="00:29:08.980" style="s2">the typical response now where the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.580" end="00:29:10.600" style="s2">majority of responses are the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.980" end="00:29:14.500" style="s2">group they&#39;re evil</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:16.900" style="s2">they&#39;re just demonic there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.500" end="00:29:20.650" style="s2">they say is right and the sooner we get</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.900" end="00:29:23.650" style="s2">rid of them the better that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.650" end="00:29:26.710" style="s2">and that&#39;s increasingly what&#39;s starting</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.650" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">to happen particularly and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.710" end="00:29:33.640" style="s2">real problems is that as you look at</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.090" end="00:29:36.309" style="s2">these ongoing stages of development</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.640" end="00:29:39.460" style="s2">throughout human history you do have</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.309" end="00:29:42.250" style="s2">kind of a leading edge and it does tend</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.460" end="00:29:46.150" style="s2">to set the sort of tenor of the epoch of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.250" end="00:29:48.730" style="s2">that time so you have really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.150" end="00:29:51.490" style="s2">developmentalist like jean gebser who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.730" end="00:29:54.549" style="s2">traced these stages in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.490" end="00:29:56.890" style="s2">worldview and so he finds we said there</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.549" end="00:30:01.240" style="s2">were on average six to eight stages up</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.890" end="00:30:03.460" style="s2">to today further stages coming but</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.240" end="00:30:05.799" style="s2">gasser comes up with stages that he</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.460" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">named I&#39;ll tweak these a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.799" end="00:30:13.230" style="s2">on our cave stage a magic stage a mythic</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">stage a rational stage a pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.230" end="00:30:19.510" style="s2">relativistic stage and an integral</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:25.450" style="s2">second-tier stage and those who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.510" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">unfolding over history as well and part</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.450" end="00:30:31.330" style="s2">of what we&#39;re seeing right now is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:34.210" style="s2">emergence of that integral or</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.330" end="00:30:36.760" style="s2">second-tier stage really for the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.210" end="00:30:40.090" style="s2">time in history now it wasn&#39;t that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.760" end="00:30:44.500" style="s2">weren&#39;t very advanced individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.090" end="00:30:47.890" style="s2">had that kind of cognition certainly you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.500" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">know Aristotle patinas that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.890" end="00:30:54.910" style="s2">individual but in terms of having like</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">around ten percent of the population</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.910" end="00:31:01.030" style="s2">reached those stages whenever we see</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:03.070" style="s2">about 10 percent reached that leading</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.030" end="00:31:05.080" style="s2">edge we do tend to see a sort of tipping</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.070" end="00:31:06.100" style="s2">point in culture and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.080" end="00:31:08.170" style="s2">what happened with the Westerner</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.100" end="00:31:10.510" style="s2">alignment for example really only about</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.170" end="00:31:14.230" style="s2">10% of the population was actually at</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.510" end="00:31:16.930" style="s2">that orange formal operational cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.230" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">stage but those values just started to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.930" end="00:31:21.640" style="s2">kind of seep out a bit and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:23.830" style="s2">that people would just fully accept them</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.640" end="00:31:26.170" style="s2">if they did they&#39;d actually be at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.830" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">Orang stage themselves but they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.170" end="00:31:33.970" style="s2">more open to them and and they became</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:36.870" style="s2">not as reactionary to them so even</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.970" end="00:31:40.770" style="s2">something like the American Civil War</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.870" end="00:31:44.380" style="s2">where you&#39;re having people fight to end</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.770" end="00:31:46.690" style="s2">ethnocentric slavery they&#39;re still less</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.380" end="00:31:49.990" style="s2">than 10% of the population is actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.690" end="00:31:53.070" style="s2">at those stages but you know impacted</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.990" end="00:31:58.380" style="s2">enough people that close to a million</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.070" end="00:32:02.260" style="s2">young men and women died trying to end</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.380" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">slavery I mean that&#39;s those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.260" end="00:32:06.970" style="s2">things are just profound the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:09.550" style="s2">happened in the 60s when we started to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.970" end="00:32:12.550" style="s2">get a green emergence as soon as it went</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.550" end="00:32:16.750" style="s2">over around 10% we actually got the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.550" end="00:32:18.700" style="s2">so-called revolution of the 60s and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.750" end="00:32:22.570" style="s2">was when we started introducing all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.700" end="00:32:25.000" style="s2">these radically egalitarian civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.570" end="00:32:27.310" style="s2">movements and so on and then even</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.000" end="00:32:29.560" style="s2">concerning the environment as a living</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.310" end="00:32:32.530" style="s2">organism we had to give attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.560" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">environment and all of those were part</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.530" end="00:32:39.610" style="s2">of the healthy aspects of green is what</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:43.510" style="s2">they introduced but the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.610" end="00:32:46.690" style="s2">as green continued to become more and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.510" end="00:32:49.420" style="s2">more extreme more and more radical more</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.690" end="00:32:54.460" style="s2">and more egalitarian more and more equal</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.420" end="00:33:00.040" style="s2">outcome period that was the leading edge</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.460" end="00:33:03.640" style="s2">of our overall evolution starting right</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.040" end="00:33:05.770" style="s2">around the 60s and that&#39;s where all of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.640" end="00:33:07.780" style="s2">sudden we started to see this shift that</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:06.310" style="s2">why and there was a real high-water mark</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.790" end="00:35:08.950" style="s2">for integral probably in the mid 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.310" end="00:35:11.460" style="s2">do you have a set had the impact on the</p>

<p begin="00:35:11.460" end="00:35:22.260" style="s2">and and if if not why not</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.920" end="00:35:22.260" style="s2">yes I&#39;ve been very actually happily</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.970" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">impressed by by how its how it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.170" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.830" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">major my my students have have divided</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.990" end="00:35:54.700" style="s2">my overall work into five major stages</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:57.490" style="s2">and you can see a continuity through all</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.700" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">of them and in an odd way they really do</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.490" end="00:36:02.830" style="s2">transcend and include I mean each of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:05.890" style="s2">each time I sort of proposed some some</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.830" end="00:36:08.740" style="s2">new additions to integral theory they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.890" end="00:36:10.510" style="s2">in almost all cases they&#39;ve included all</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.740" end="00:36:12.580" style="s2">the previous stuff I don&#39;t disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.510" end="00:36:15.310" style="s2">that I&#39;ve just added some more stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.580" end="00:36:20.200" style="s2">that I found that&#39;s important and so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.310" end="00:36:22.360" style="s2">sort of keeps going like that when I hit</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.200" end="00:36:27.670" style="s2">around so called</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.360" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">stage 4 it was a book called sex ecology</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.670" end="00:36:35.320" style="s2">spirituality and it really did cause a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:37.330" style="s2">bit of a sensation at least in these</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.320" end="00:36:41.230" style="s2">small circles that think about these</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.330" end="00:36:46.450" style="s2">kinds of things and for about the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.230" end="00:36:50.230" style="s2">10 years there was an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.450" end="00:36:54.100" style="s2">theoretical talk about it and so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.230" end="00:36:58.390" style="s2">was happened all around the world there</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.100" end="00:37:01.660" style="s2">were over like I say the book has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.390" end="00:37:04.300" style="s2">translated into upwards of 30 the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.660" end="00:37:08.430" style="s2">foreign languages they&#39;re integral</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.300" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">Institute&#39;s starting or started in</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.430" end="00:37:17.340" style="s2">several dozen countries and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:19.930" style="s2">there&#39;s this this really strong</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.340" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">theoretical discussion about these</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.930" end="00:37:29.050" style="s2">issues again you can be critical any of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:32.860" style="s2">the good ideas that came up I</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.050" end="00:37:35.080" style="s2">immediately incorporated but the net</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.860" end="00:37:40.210" style="s2">result of all of that tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.080" end="00:37:42.700" style="s2">essentially the same model that people</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.210" end="00:37:43.850" style="s2">had started discussion discussing there</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.700" end="00:37:47.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that many</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.850" end="00:37:52.070" style="s2">radical changes to it that that were put</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.120" end="00:37:56.420" style="s2">forward in unbelievable ways and that 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.070" end="00:38:01.850" style="s2">years we went from around 1995 and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.420" end="00:38:06.050" style="s2">book was done till around 2005 but then</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.850" end="00:38:09.580" style="s2">after that 10 year period as the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.050" end="00:38:11.840" style="s2">framework emerged more or less intact</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.580" end="00:38:14.450" style="s2">people started taking it and just</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.840" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">running out and applying and when they</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.450" end="00:38:23.630" style="s2">started doing that they they stopped in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">a sense having conferences on that or</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.630" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">getting together in discussing that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:31.100" style="s2">it looked like it had just dispersed and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:33.550" style="s2">in a certain sense it had but what had</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.100" end="00:38:35.480" style="s2">happened previously is that if you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.550" end="00:38:39.950" style="s2">theoretically thinking about something</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.480" end="00:38:41.390" style="s2">like this and we had journals that were</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:44.510" style="s2">being published at the time that were</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.390" end="00:38:47.450" style="s2">peer-reviewed based on integral meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.510" end="00:38:49.670" style="s2">theory and there were over 60 different</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.450" end="00:38:52.340" style="s2">human disciplines that were</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.670" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">reinterpreted completely using this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.340" end="00:38:57.640" style="s2">integral framework to make more</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:39:00.290" style="s2">comprehensive and inclusive and holistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.640" end="00:39:03.580" style="s2">approaches I mean we had internal</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.290" end="00:39:06.250" style="s2">education internal psychology integral</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.580" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">sociology integral art into pro history</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:14.810" style="s2">integral law literally over 60</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.600" end="00:39:17.000" style="s2">disciplines like that and all of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.810" end="00:39:20.420" style="s2">claimed to be happier with the result</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.000" end="00:39:22.670" style="s2">they certainly included more aspects</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.420" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">than they had previously a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.670" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">are quite suspicious of spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:30.530" style="s2">yeah partly because they see that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:32.150" style="s2">of spiritual communities go bad and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.530" end="00:39:34.520" style="s2">partly as a journalist I feel I have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.150" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">ask you this question as well and there</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.520" end="00:39:38.210" style="s2">have been a spiritual communities that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:40.610" style="s2">have had a lot of bad press that have</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.210" end="00:39:43.310" style="s2">gone bad the most high-profile probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.610" end="00:39:46.090" style="s2">being Andrew Cohen and he he&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.310" end="00:39:51.220" style="s2">like even very close to him in the past</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.090" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">what lessons can we learn from that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.220" end="00:40:00.109" style="s2">this is one item the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">general framework has shed an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.109" end="00:40:06.170" style="s2">amount of light on and again I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:08.030" style="s2">saying that there aren&#39;t other factors</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.170" end="00:40:11.829" style="s2">that are important but here&#39;s one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.030" end="00:40:17.380" style="s2">really really central and it came up</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.829" end="00:40:20.780" style="s2">earlier when we mentioned things like</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.380" end="00:40:25.490" style="s2">yes Brutus can be doing this practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.780" end="00:40:27.319" style="s2">for certain Isis okay whoa I mean if all</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.490" end="00:40:29.450" style="s2">we&#39;re saying is you know do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.319" end="00:40:32.450" style="s2">trying to find alternate unity</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:34.339" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s not enough because</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.450" end="00:40:36.440" style="s2">it could produce Isis or it could</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.339" end="00:40:39.619" style="s2">produce a nice Buddhist community so</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.440" end="00:40:43.490" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.619" end="00:40:46.339" style="s2">striking things we found is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.490" end="00:40:49.010" style="s2">look at that actual waking up or</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.339" end="00:40:51.380" style="s2">enlightenment experience which again</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.010" end="00:40:54.619" style="s2">wherever it shows up is claimed to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.380" end="00:40:57.890" style="s2">just simply by itself the Silman bonum</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.619" end="00:41:01.190" style="s2">just by itself it has everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.890" end="00:41:03.530" style="s2">perfect and and you get that and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.190" end="00:41:07.549" style="s2">got it all you don&#39;t need anything else</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.530" end="00:41:10.190" style="s2">that is complete liberation those</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.549" end="00:41:13.819" style="s2">experiences aren&#39;t the first person</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.190" end="00:41:16.309" style="s2">direct immediate experiences so again</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.819" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not a belief system it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.309" end="00:41:21.799" style="s2">mythic system in a typical sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:23.660" style="s2">Moses parting the Red Sea or Lot&#39;s wife</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.799" end="00:41:24.380" style="s2">turning into a pillar of salt or</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.660" end="00:41:27.049" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.380" end="00:41:29.869" style="s2">these are direct immediate experiences</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.049" end="00:41:32.089" style="s2">that you have so you can&#39;t see these</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.569" end="00:41:53.660" style="s2">of them saw structures of growing up at</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.910" end="00:42:10.760" style="s2">why you can be it almost any stage of</p>

<p begin="00:42:10.760" end="00:42:14.869" style="s2">and go through the whole sequence of</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.869" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">that you&#39;ll just be interpreting that</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.670" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">that you&#39;re at and that turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.150" end="00:42:31.670" style="s2">disastrous because up and kill around</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:34.970" style="s2">the Western enlightenment when that</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.089" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">essentially where they were and so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.990" end="00:42:55.780" style="s2">could have this extraordinary experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:58.579" style="s2">of oneness but it could be had only</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.780" end="00:43:03.609" style="s2">through their own particular approach</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.579" end="00:43:06.619" style="s2">and so they ended up being indeed</p>

<p begin="00:43:06.619" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">experience of oneness so that&#39;s how</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.550" end="00:43:21.020" style="s2">of development can still have this</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.020" end="00:43:26.900" style="s2">to interpret it in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:30.020" style="s2">ethnocentric stage this is an experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.900" end="00:43:32.569" style="s2">that I&#39;m having with Allah and only</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.020" end="00:43:36.140" style="s2">those who accept Allah can have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.569" end="00:43:38.810" style="s2">experience and Samuel even say you know</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.220" end="00:43:48.440" style="s2">because they&#39;re in this mystical state</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.220" end="00:43:52.450" style="s2">of waking up and I&#39;m sure some of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.440" end="00:43:55.700" style="s2">are but they&#39;re having it at this</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.450" end="00:43:58.010" style="s2">ethnocentric bigoted prejudice stage of</p>

<p begin="00:43:58.010" end="00:44:03.310" style="s2">that that&#39;s the nightmare Loren Shorty&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.339" end="00:44:06.680" style="s2">is almost none of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.310" end="00:44:09.170" style="s2">developmental models have any of the</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.170" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">understanding of enlightenment or</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.520" end="00:44:16.990" style="s2">awakening or the great liberation or</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:21.020" style="s2">moksha or Satori or any of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.990" end="00:44:24.109" style="s2">you have these stages of growing up and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.020" end="00:44:26.479" style="s2">they have no understanding of waking up</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.109" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">and then you have these systems of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.479" end="00:44:31.369" style="s2">waking up and they have no comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:33.349" style="s2">of growing up stages and these two</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.369" end="00:44:35.180" style="s2">things are relatively independent it can</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.349" end="00:44:37.819" style="s2">be very high in one and very low on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.180" end="00:44:40.039" style="s2">other very high in this and very low in</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.819" end="00:44:42.529" style="s2">this but the point is there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.039" end="00:44:44.599" style="s2">single system in the world including</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.529" end="00:44:48.890" style="s2">spiritual systems that include both of</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.599" end="00:44:52.219" style="s2">those ever and that means humanity to us</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.890" end="00:44:58.910" style="s2">entire history has been training itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.219" end="00:45:01.849" style="s2">to be broken so part of the problem even</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.910" end="00:45:05.739" style="s2">when you have a religious movement a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.849" end="00:45:08.450" style="s2">spiritual movement like Andy Cohen and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.739" end="00:45:13.609" style="s2">they are very much aware of waking up</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.450" end="00:45:15.049" style="s2">station that&#39;s what they&#39;re after they</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.609" end="00:45:18.499" style="s2">don&#39;t have an understanding of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.049" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">growing up stages and so they can be</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.499" end="00:45:26.089" style="s2">very much at ethnocentric with highly</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:28.190" style="s2">authoritarian guru dominant types of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.089" end="00:45:31.219" style="s2">orientations and still be having</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.190" end="00:45:33.709" style="s2">stunning waking up experiences but then</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.219" end="00:45:35.930" style="s2">interpreting it all in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.709" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">this specific group is getting it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.930" end="00:45:40.969" style="s2">just their leader is the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:44.150" style="s2">giving this to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.969" end="00:45:46.789" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what Andrew Cohen got</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.150" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">into and he understood integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.789" end="00:45:54.170" style="s2">quite well and he and I actually would</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:58.069" style="s2">do a dialogue in in their magazine what</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.170" end="00:46:01.269" style="s2">his enlightenment and when he ended up</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.069" end="00:46:05.449" style="s2">crashing well first of all he was always</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.269" end="00:46:08.119" style="s2">very appreciative about the integral</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.449" end="00:46:11.180" style="s2">model he talked about it a lot but he</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.119" end="00:46:15.289" style="s2">himself still got caught in these</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.180" end="00:46:17.269" style="s2">growing up stage aspects and he finally</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.289" end="00:46:21.339" style="s2">ended up interpreting what caused his</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.269" end="00:46:25.190" style="s2">crash is that he had this very mythic</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.339" end="00:46:29.569" style="s2">ethnocentric amber aspect of himself</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.190" end="00:46:30.829" style="s2">that really did take himself as being</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.569" end="00:46:33.049" style="s2">the one in ultimate guru</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.829" end="00:46:34.789" style="s2">it was the most enlightened person on</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.049" end="00:46:37.640" style="s2">the face of the planet this is all</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.789" end="00:46:40.099" style="s2">falling down into ethnocentric and he</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.640" end="00:46:42.470" style="s2">lower the stage right under that is ego</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.099" end="00:46:45.890" style="s2">centric and you had some questions about</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.470" end="00:46:49.190" style="s2">or doesn&#39;t that happen yeah that happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.890" end="00:46:51.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s just right there he got</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.190" end="00:46:55.880" style="s2">caught in that and that&#39;s how he came to</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.650" end="00:46:58.369" style="s2">interpret the problem and so he&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.880" end="00:47:03.099" style="s2">took several years off did a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.369" end="00:47:07.250" style="s2">on that issue and he&#39;s now coming back</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.099" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">he has something that I think he just</p>

<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:14.109" style="s2">along that line</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.410" end="00:47:16.309" style="s2">and by the way Buddha Dharma Sangha</p>
