<p begin="00:00:31.430" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.780" end="00:00:42.630" style="s2">thank you all for coming out</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:43.380" style="s2">well good evening Dublin as you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.630" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">heard</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.380" end="00:00:49.850" style="s2">Jordan pizza and Sam Harris met the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">first time in person two weeks ago now</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.850" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">in Vancouver they covered an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:01:01.850" style="s2">amount of ground and there is I think an</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">enormous amount of ground still to cover</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.850" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">but I&#39;ve asked them if they would start</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:13.440" style="s2">this evening in the following way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:17.120" style="s2">all familiar with straw Manning anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.440" end="00:01:19.320" style="s2">who follows politics knows straw Manning</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.120" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">but I&#39;ve asked them to do the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.320" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">tonight to start by Steele Manning the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">arguments of each other to present in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">the best possible most fair most</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">rigorous light what they understand to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">be the others argument on all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">major issues were about to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.119" end="00:01:53.090" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna ask Sam Harris to go first and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.179" end="00:01:55.219" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go from there right thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.090" end="00:01:57.229" style="s2">you so first thank you all for coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.219" end="00:02:05.689" style="s2">it&#39;s really it&#39;s an immense privilege</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.229" end="00:02:07.219" style="s2">for us to do this and I should say many</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.689" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">of you have sacrificed a lot to come</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.219" end="00:02:10.940" style="s2">here people have come from other</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:13.010" style="s2">countries I&#39;m told you all dealt with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.940" end="00:02:20.810" style="s2">ticketing system that seems like it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.010" end="00:02:23.030" style="s2">run from a cave in Afghanistan it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.810" end="00:02:24.739" style="s2">again thank you all because it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:26.060" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s one thing for us to put</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.739" end="00:02:28.099" style="s2">this date on the calendar and say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.060" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">gonna speak here it&#39;s another for all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.099" end="00:02:31.310" style="s2">you to show up and this is a privilege</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:37.310" style="s2">we certainly don&#39;t take for granted so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.310" end="00:02:40.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s an immense one so short and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.310" end="00:02:43.970" style="s2">I should say that though much of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.280" end="00:02:46.489" style="s2">conversation together will often sound</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.970" end="00:02:48.920" style="s2">like we&#39;re debating it will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.489" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">there none of us are in the in the habit</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.920" end="00:02:54.019" style="s2">of pulling our punches there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:56.150" style="s2">immense amount of goodwill here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.019" end="00:03:00.139" style="s2">it&#39;s true on stage it&#39;s true off stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:03:03.230" style="s2">and we&#39;re all trying to refine our</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.139" end="00:03:05.389" style="s2">beliefs together in conversation so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.230" end="00:03:07.730" style="s2">wooden none of us view this as a debate</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.389" end="00:03:11.420" style="s2">though we might stridently disagree</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.730" end="00:03:13.910" style="s2">about one thing or another what so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.420" end="00:03:18.470" style="s2">Jordan I think disagrees with me about I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.910" end="00:03:20.090" style="s2">think he&#39;s worried that I we clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.470" end="00:03:25.000" style="s2">have a common project we are both</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.090" end="00:03:27.590" style="s2">concerned to understand how to live</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.000" end="00:03:29.780" style="s2">lives worth living how can we do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.590" end="00:03:32.810" style="s2">individually and how can we build</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.780" end="00:03:35.329" style="s2">societies that safeguard this project</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.810" end="00:03:37.910" style="s2">for millions of people attempting to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.329" end="00:03:40.489" style="s2">this in in their diverse ways and so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.910" end="00:03:43.010" style="s2">many questions immediately come online</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.489" end="00:03:45.230" style="s2">when you try to do that but what is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.010" end="00:03:48.590" style="s2">relationship between facts and values</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.230" end="00:03:51.709" style="s2">for instance or science and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.590" end="00:03:53.870" style="s2">experience or our ethical lives and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.709" end="00:03:56.269" style="s2">have you know as for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.870" end="00:03:58.210" style="s2">different answers to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.269" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">Jordan is concerned</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.210" end="00:04:04.570" style="s2">I in my allergy to religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">insufficiently value the power of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.570" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">stories in general and religious stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:12.310" style="s2">in particular that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:15.940" style="s2">something more than just naked ly</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.310" end="00:04:18.520" style="s2">engaging with facts as they are but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:20.800" style="s2">don&#39;t simply come into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.520" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">reality we have to interpret reality we</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.800" end="00:04:26.230" style="s2">interpret it through our senses and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">with our brains obviously but you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.230" end="00:04:30.970" style="s2">frameworks and as jordan would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">stories with which to do that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.970" end="00:04:42.150" style="s2">get facts in the raw and jordan believes</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:44.530" style="s2">that i because my purpose so often is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.150" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">counter what i view as the dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.530" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">dogmas within religion i ignore the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">power and even the necessity of certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:55.630" style="s2">kinds of stories and certain ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">thinking about the world and our</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.630" end="00:05:01.510" style="s2">situation in the world that that not</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:03.940" style="s2">only bring many many millions and even</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.510" end="00:05:06.250" style="s2">billions of people immense value are in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.940" end="00:05:08.860" style="s2">fact necessary for anyone however</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.250" end="00:05:13.750" style="s2">rational to build a society where all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.860" end="00:05:16.780" style="s2">our our well-being can can be conserved</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.750" end="00:05:20.070" style="s2">so i think if in brief that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.780" end="00:05:20.070" style="s2">jordan&#39;s concerned about me</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.159" end="00:05:33.979" style="s2">so Sam is concerned I would say above</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.289" end="00:05:36.860" style="s2">all with the minimization of unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.979" end="00:05:38.929" style="s2">suffering which seems to me to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.860" end="00:05:48.709" style="s2">pretty good place to start</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.929" end="00:05:50.689" style="s2">and he&#39;s concerned that he&#39;s concerned</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.709" end="00:05:53.149" style="s2">that in order to do that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.689" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">develop an ethic and that ethic should</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.149" end="00:05:57.580" style="s2">be grounded in that realization that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:05:59.749" style="s2">unnecessary suffering is worth</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.580" end="00:06:04.279" style="s2">contending with and dealing with and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.749" end="00:06:06.409" style="s2">that and that if we make too much of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.279" end="00:06:08.869" style="s2">divide between facts and values then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.409" end="00:06:12.259" style="s2">end up in a situation where our value</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.869" end="00:06:15.050" style="s2">structure has no super subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.259" end="00:06:17.929" style="s2">foundational grounding and this is a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.050" end="00:06:20.089" style="s2">problem so generally in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.929" end="00:06:22.089" style="s2">philosophical community it&#39;s accepted</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.089" end="00:06:24.739" style="s2">although not universally that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.089" end="00:06:27.110" style="s2">difficult if not impossible to derive</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.739" end="00:06:29.389" style="s2">values from facts but the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.110" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">that proposition is that you end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.389" end="00:06:33.829" style="s2">situation where either you lose all your</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.839" style="s2">values because they&#39;re just arbitrary or</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.829" end="00:06:38.839" style="s2">you or you have to ground them in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.839" end="00:06:42.379" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.839" end="00:06:43.789" style="s2">revelatory and Sam is concerned that one</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.379" end="00:06:45.649" style="s2">of the negative consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.789" end="00:06:47.509" style="s2">grounding your fundamental ethic in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.649" end="00:06:50.349" style="s2">something that&#39;s revealed is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.509" end="00:06:52.909" style="s2">emergent consequence of irrational</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.349" end="00:06:55.159" style="s2">fundamentalism and so obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.909" end="00:06:57.229" style="s2">worth contending with and so he&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.159" end="00:06:59.979" style="s2">issue with the philosophical idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.229" end="00:07:02.209" style="s2">facts and values have to be separate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.979" end="00:07:04.849" style="s2">formulating the proposition that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.209" end="00:07:06.829" style="s2">in fact ground a universal system of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.849" end="00:07:08.779" style="s2">values in the facts and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.829" end="00:07:13.279" style="s2">mediate between the facts and the system</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.779" end="00:07:15.789" style="s2">of values using using our facility for</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.279" end="00:07:19.069" style="s2">truth but even more specifically our</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.789" end="00:07:20.839" style="s2">facility for rationality and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.069" end="00:07:22.819" style="s2">rationality can be the mediator between</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.839" end="00:07:27.169" style="s2">the world of facts and the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.819" end="00:07:29.629" style="s2">world of values and so the problem I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.169" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">have with that I guess if if we can skip</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.629" end="00:07:36.379" style="s2">briefly to problems is that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">obvious to me how to produce an ethos</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.379" end="00:07:42.140" style="s2">with sufficient motivating power</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.760" style="s2">to to ground that conception of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.140" end="00:07:46.670" style="s2">minimization of suffering say and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.760" end="00:07:49.310" style="s2">promotion of well-being in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.670" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">that grips people and unites the society</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.310" end="00:07:55.340" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:57.200" style="s2">what we&#39;re discussing and trying to sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.340" end="00:08:01.400" style="s2">out with regards to the potential role</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.200" end="00:08:03.980" style="s2">of narrative and religious belief as an</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.400" end="00:08:06.050" style="s2">underpinning to this ethos we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.980" end="00:08:08.630" style="s2">agree on the necessity for the universal</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:10.220" style="s2">ethos we even seem to agree I would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.630" end="00:08:12.350" style="s2">on what that is because certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.220" end="00:08:15.130" style="s2">minimization of suffering seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.350" end="00:08:19.190" style="s2">be a very good place to start we share</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.130" end="00:08:21.500" style="s2">our concern with and a belief that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.190" end="00:08:23.540" style="s2">pathway to that ethos is in some manner</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.500" end="00:08:27.860" style="s2">related to our ability to speak the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.540" end="00:08:29.780" style="s2">truth but we disagree on what that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.860" end="00:08:31.760" style="s2">to be grounded in and how it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.780" end="00:08:33.169" style="s2">grounded my sense especially after</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.760" end="00:08:36.919" style="s2">thinking about our discussion is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.169" end="00:08:39.500" style="s2">Sam makes what rationality is do too</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.919" end="00:08:41.330" style="s2">much work and I&#39;m hoping that not that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.500" end="00:08:43.190" style="s2">rationality is irrelevant or unimportant</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.330" end="00:08:45.650" style="s2">because it clearly is neither of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.190" end="00:08:47.330" style="s2">but maybe the Devils in the details and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.650" end="00:08:50.870" style="s2">hopefully we can get down to the details</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.330" end="00:08:52.790" style="s2">tonight and we we for me we brought</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.870" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">Douglas into the conversation he&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.790" end="00:08:58.250" style="s2">to serve as much more than a mere</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.050" end="00:09:01.430" style="s2">moderator and partly we&#39;ve determined</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.250" end="00:09:03.860" style="s2">that as Sam alluded to that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.430" end="00:09:06.280" style="s2">actually trying to figure out is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.860" end="00:09:10.089" style="s2">are the minimal necessary preconditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.280" end="00:09:13.480" style="s2">for the construction of engaged</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.089" end="00:09:16.250" style="s2">productive individuals with meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.480" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">responsible lives in a society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.250" end="00:09:21.260" style="s2">stable enough to sustain itself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">dynamic enough to change what are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.260" end="00:09:25.730" style="s2">minimal preconditions for that what are</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:27.740" style="s2">the and and and how do we ground those</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.730" end="00:09:30.830" style="s2">presuppositions those preconditions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.740" end="00:09:32.180" style="s2">what price do we pay for for having them</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.830" end="00:09:34.190" style="s2">because you never get something without</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:36.470" style="s2">a cost and we thought that Douglass</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.190" end="00:09:38.660" style="s2">would be very interesting addition to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.470" end="00:09:40.610" style="s2">this conversation because of course he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.660" end="00:09:43.690" style="s2">concentrated on such things as borders</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.610" end="00:09:46.190" style="s2">and when you set up preconditions for</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.690" end="00:09:48.110" style="s2">social order you also automatically</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.190" end="00:09:49.820" style="s2">produce such things as hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.110" end="00:09:51.769" style="s2">borders and they don&#39;t come without a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.820" end="00:09:53.720" style="s2">cost and so we hope</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.769" end="00:09:56.029" style="s2">expand the conversation to include a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.720" end="00:09:58.249" style="s2">discussion of those issues as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.029" end="00:10:00.290" style="s2">before Douglass chimes in I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.249" end="00:10:02.660" style="s2">reiterate the fact that he has not been</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.290" end="00:10:05.029" style="s2">cast here as our moderator though if</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.660" end="00:10:07.220" style="s2">Jordan and I run off the rails I expect</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.029" end="00:10:07.790" style="s2">Douglas to put us back on in the King&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.220" end="00:10:10.009" style="s2">English</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.790" end="00:10:13.660" style="s2">I&#39;m not moderate enough to be a moderate</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.009" end="00:10:19.009" style="s2">no but you&#39;re more moderate than either</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.660" end="00:10:21.170" style="s2">of us are but so I want I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.009" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">reset the part of your brain that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.170" end="00:10:26.329" style="s2">poised to begrudge the moderator taking</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:28.299" style="s2">up too much time because every moderator</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.329" end="00:10:31.970" style="s2">has felt that and Fred Weinstein was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.299" end="00:10:33.949" style="s2">brilliantly aloof and uninvolved in much</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.970" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">of our exchange together but but Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.949" end="00:10:39.110" style="s2">really is a third participant here and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:41.899" style="s2">and he stands between Jordan and I on</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.110" end="00:10:44.149" style="s2">some issues in an interesting way so</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.899" end="00:10:46.670" style="s2">that there say we have a three-way</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.149" end="00:10:49.819" style="s2">conversation here where none of us is</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.670" end="00:10:52.220" style="s2">really sitting in the same spot so can I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.819" end="00:10:54.980" style="s2">make a quick observation about some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.220" end="00:10:56.449" style="s2">this some of the progress that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.980" end="00:10:58.249" style="s2">already made in Vancouver some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.449" end="00:11:01.759" style="s2">progress I hope we can make tonight</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.249" end="00:11:05.119" style="s2">seems to be I see one thing that hampers</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.759" end="00:11:08.119" style="s2">it and let me go straight to it with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.119" end="00:11:09.709" style="s2">which is I discovered the terrific</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.119" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">phrase the other day that our mutual</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.709" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">friend Eric Weinstein came up with we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:16.249" style="s2">talking about the manner in which you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:19.339" style="s2">can discuss within the sciences certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.249" end="00:11:21.019" style="s2">scientific problems and he said look if</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.339" end="00:11:22.939" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a scientist who you know is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.019" end="00:11:25.699" style="s2">also basically a very literalist</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.939" end="00:11:28.129" style="s2">Christian you will listen to their</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.699" end="00:11:30.619" style="s2">argument a whole long part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.129" end="00:11:31.579" style="s2">and there&#39;s some where at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.619" end="00:11:33.379" style="s2">you know you&#39;re going to be worried</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.579" end="00:11:36.049" style="s2">about it and he came up with this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.379" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve I love this face he says Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.049" end="00:11:42.170" style="s2">smuggling right</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:45.410" style="s2">Jesus smuggling is you&#39;re gonna follow</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.170" end="00:11:47.180" style="s2">all the way yes yes and then the worry</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.410" end="00:11:48.980" style="s2">is that when you get to the bit that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.180" end="00:11:52.940" style="s2">you&#39;re not so good on that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.980" end="00:11:55.730" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna smuggle in Jesus yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.940" end="00:11:58.990" style="s2">suspicion is that you have a reservation</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.730" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">about some of what Jordan is saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.990" end="00:12:04.220" style="s2">substructures on stories are much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:06.680" style="s2">because you&#39;re worried but at some point</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.220" end="00:12:08.180" style="s2">either on this stage or off it at some</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.680" end="00:12:11.990" style="s2">point when you&#39;re not looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.180" end="00:12:22.700" style="s2">no no yes or when I am looking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.990" end="00:12:27.590" style="s2">going to Jesus smuggle yeah yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.700" end="00:12:30.950" style="s2">carry him in on a cross well that is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.590" end="00:12:35.750" style="s2">all too apt analogy because it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.950" end="00:12:37.630" style="s2">what worries me and it&#39;s but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.750" end="00:12:40.040" style="s2">more subtle than that because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.630" end="00:12:44.390" style="s2">just to think that you&#39;re consciously</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.040" end="00:12:46.700" style="s2">doing it is is a different claim like</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.390" end="00:12:48.860" style="s2">you there&#39;s I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.700" end="00:12:50.630" style="s2">anything insincere about your argument</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.860" end="00:12:53.030" style="s2">for the for the importance of religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.630" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s also possible we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.030" end="00:12:56.030" style="s2">met the people who we believe are making</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">insincere arguments and are really</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.030" end="00:13:00.500" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re consciously putting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">rabbit in the Hat and then pretending to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.500" end="00:13:07.240" style="s2">be surprised when it pops out right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:11.840" style="s2">and in the analogy of magic is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.240" end="00:13:15.100" style="s2">interesting here because we be in a we</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.840" end="00:13:17.720" style="s2">had over dinner we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.100" end="00:13:19.850" style="s2">the the difference between real and fake</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.720" end="00:13:22.190" style="s2">art and we were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.850" end="00:13:25.160" style="s2">parrot is paradox that art seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.190" end="00:13:27.500" style="s2">incredibly valuable and yet the value</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.160" end="00:13:29.150" style="s2">isn&#39;t located in the object itself or</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.500" end="00:13:30.500" style="s2">can&#39;t be obviously located there because</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.150" end="00:13:33.950" style="s2">a forgery</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.500" end="00:13:35.720" style="s2">that is the materially the exact copy of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.950" end="00:13:38.030" style="s2">some masterpiece is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.720" end="00:13:40.700" style="s2">worthless and the real masterpiece even</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.030" end="00:13:43.700" style="s2">if it suffered some damage would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.700" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">incredibly valuable and so where is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.700" end="00:13:48.290" style="s2">value to be located but what worries me</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:52.070" style="s2">about your enterprise Jordan and the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.290" end="00:13:53.270" style="s2">in which your you seem to be linking our</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.070" end="00:13:56.030" style="s2">national project in our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.270" end="00:13:57.470" style="s2">project where the religion is is right</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.030" end="00:14:00.470" style="s2">here there&#39;s there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.470" end="00:14:02.110" style="s2">between and magic as a decent analogy</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.470" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.110" end="00:14:07.730" style="s2">paradoxically real magic is fake magic</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:11.000" style="s2">and fake magic is real magic the only</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:13.520" style="s2">the only real magic in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.000" end="00:14:15.350" style="s2">produced by magicians is the fake magic</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.520" end="00:14:16.850" style="s2">where the magician like someone like</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.350" end="00:14:18.770" style="s2">Darren Brown will tell you actually no I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.850" end="00:14:20.660" style="s2">can&#39;t read minds and I did put the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.770" end="00:14:23.240" style="s2">rabbit in the Hat and this is fake but</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.660" end="00:14:25.490" style="s2">but the the surprise is that even</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.240" end="00:14:27.160" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s fake you can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.490" end="00:14:31.130" style="s2">how this effect is being achieved</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.160" end="00:14:32.900" style="s2">whereas the fake magicians are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.130" end="00:14:35.870" style="s2">who are pretending to be real who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.900" end="00:14:38.930" style="s2">who are hiding who are not acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.870" end="00:14:41.410" style="s2">the mechanics the real mechanics behind</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.930" end="00:14:43.490" style="s2">what is in fact effective you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.410" end="00:14:48.020" style="s2">illusion of the rabbit pops out of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.490" end="00:14:50.540" style="s2">Hat and what I worry with with some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:52.430" style="s2">you or the way in which you discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.540" end="00:14:56.260" style="s2">power of story the power of metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.430" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">the religious anchor in there is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.260" end="00:15:04.310" style="s2">the the leverage and the utility can be</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.290" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">fakeness of the magic right and you seem</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.870" end="00:15:13.700" style="s2">to suspect that it can - that takes all</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:16.400" style="s2">of them wind out of the sails I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.700" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">sure I&#39;m not so sure what if it&#39;s fake</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.400" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">and what if it isn&#39;t well like what so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">would say that I do consciously</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:26.990" style="s2">participate in the process that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:28.370" style="s2">described and but but you see I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.990" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">also make the case and this is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.370" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.810" end="00:15:34.760" style="s2">been discussing that you do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.170" style="s2">unconsciously and let me make the case</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.760" end="00:15:37.160" style="s2">for that Freeman because I&#39;d really I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.170" end="00:15:39.410" style="s2">been thinking about it a lot and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.160" end="00:15:41.630" style="s2">like to see your response so here&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.410" end="00:15:43.910" style="s2">what I really read the moral landscape a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.630" end="00:15:45.950" style="s2">lot and I thought about it a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.910" end="00:15:49.460" style="s2">know and so this is what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.950" end="00:15:51.110" style="s2">to me so you you you make the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.460" end="00:15:53.240" style="s2">proposition that we have to breach the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.110" end="00:15:55.180" style="s2">gap between facts and values because</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.240" end="00:15:58.070" style="s2">otherwise our values are left hanging</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.180" end="00:15:59.930" style="s2">unmoored and that certainly brings about</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.070" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">the danger of nihilism but also a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.930" end="00:16:02.990" style="s2">potential danger of swings that hotel</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:04.130" style="s2">the tourism something will you bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.990" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">about right Rudy</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.130" end="00:16:08.990" style="s2">believe that and then you perform an</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">operation conceptual operation and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.990" end="00:16:14.180" style="s2">say surely we can all agree that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:16.430" style="s2">then you outline a story about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.180" end="00:16:18.620" style="s2">woman who lives in this horrible country</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.430" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">and who&#39;s basically just being starved</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.620" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">and disease ridden and tortured her</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:23.720" style="s2">whole life and having just a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:26.090" style="s2">time of it to put it in a phrase and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.720" end="00:16:28.610" style="s2">then you say well surely we can all</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.090" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">agree that that&#39;s not good and then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.610" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">contrast that with at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:34.700" style="s2">the sort of life that we would all like</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.830" style="s2">to have if we could choose the life that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.700" end="00:16:38.570" style="s2">we have and then you say well we could</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.830" end="00:16:41.450" style="s2">start with the proposition that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.570" end="00:16:43.700" style="s2">should move away from this this terrible</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.450" end="00:16:47.060" style="s2">hellish circumstance and we should move</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.700" end="00:16:49.630" style="s2">towards this more ideal perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.060" end="00:16:53.420" style="s2">you say if we could only agree on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.630" end="00:16:55.700" style="s2">then and so and so like so far so good</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.420" end="00:16:56.930" style="s2">but this is this is there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.700" end="00:16:58.340" style="s2">couple of things that go along with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.930" end="00:17:00.950" style="s2">that are quite interesting and so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.340" end="00:17:03.710" style="s2">first is that actually what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.950" end="00:17:07.550" style="s2">claiming is that the highest moral good</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.710" end="00:17:09.589" style="s2">isn&#39;t existing in that better space the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.550" end="00:17:11.630" style="s2">highest moral good is acting in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.589" end="00:17:14.540" style="s2">manner that moves us from the hellish</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.630" end="00:17:16.069" style="s2">domain to the desirable domain it seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.540" end="00:17:17.480" style="s2">to me to be implicit in your argument so</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.069" end="00:17:20.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a pattern of behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.480" end="00:17:23.959" style="s2">constitutes the ethic well I would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.660" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">that existing and that&#39;s in that better</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.959" end="00:17:28.160" style="s2">space is good enough as well as I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s the there&#39;s the question of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:31.730" style="s2">what it takes to move from where you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:33.260" style="s2">to someplace better and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.730" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">just the someplace that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.260" end="00:17:38.540" style="s2">both of yes well but but we perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:41.090" style="s2">could say look what&#39;s the ultimate hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.540" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">it might be existing in the hell that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.090" end="00:17:44.710" style="s2">you describe but it also might be this</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.100" end="00:17:46.940" style="s2">is something worse I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.710" end="00:17:49.130" style="s2">participating in the process that brings</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.940" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">about that hell is actually a hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.130" end="00:17:53.330" style="s2">that&#39;s even deeper than the hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:56.210" style="s2">so it&#39;s an analogous argument there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.330" end="00:17:57.380" style="s2">the state of being in a good state but</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.210" end="00:17:59.240" style="s2">there&#39;s also the state of being that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.380" end="00:18:00.500" style="s2">brings you to that good state and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:02.540" style="s2">there&#39;s the state of being that&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.500" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible state and the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.540" end="00:18:06.740" style="s2">that brings you to that terrible state</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:09.800" style="s2">and one of the things that I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.740" end="00:18:11.060" style="s2">from the archetypal and religious texts</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.800" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">that I&#39;ve studied as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.060" end="00:18:17.250" style="s2">philosophical texts is that the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:19.230" style="s2">that transforms society into</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.250" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2">thing approximating hell is a lower hell</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.230" end="00:18:22.980" style="s2">no well the reason well let me just</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:24.870" style="s2">close the loop on that because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.980" end="00:18:27.090" style="s2">pretty sure I disagree one you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.870" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">imagine to counter examples one is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.090" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">can imagine a sadistic being a you might</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:36.270" style="s2">even call him God who would create a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:38.810" style="s2">circumstance of Hell and populate it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.270" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">with innocent souls right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.810" end="00:18:44.580" style="s2">presumably that action it need not be</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:45.930" style="s2">attended by a lot of suffering or you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.580" end="00:18:49.170" style="s2">could imagine some no but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.930" end="00:18:51.300" style="s2">it&#39;s still wrong wrong yes no you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.170" end="00:18:52.920" style="s2">even imagine someone who enjoys generate</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.300" end="00:18:54.900" style="s2">exactly yes it could yes so that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.920" end="00:18:56.850" style="s2">even be more wrong than not enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.900" end="00:18:58.440" style="s2">right okay so we want to separate out</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.850" end="00:19:00.870" style="s2">two things we want to separate out these</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">states of being and the process that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.870" end="00:19:04.260" style="s2">brings them into being and I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:05.850" style="s2">you do that in your work because</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.260" end="00:19:08.340" style="s2">basically what you suggest is that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.850" end="00:19:10.410" style="s2">appropriate way to act ethically is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.340" end="00:19:12.420" style="s2">act in a manner that moves us away from</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.410" end="00:19:14.520" style="s2">hell and moves us towards a desirable</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.420" end="00:19:15.750" style="s2">state now the thing is is that as far as</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.520" end="00:19:17.790" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned there&#39;s a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.750" end="00:19:20.940" style="s2">about that the first thing is that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.790" end="00:19:23.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that that mode of acting is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:25.890" style="s2">a fact I would say it&#39;s a personality</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.190" end="00:19:27.990" style="s2">and that what you&#39;re suggesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.890" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">people embody the personality that moves</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.990" end="00:19:32.040" style="s2">Society away from Hell towards heaven</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">for lack of a better term and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.040" end="00:19:36.650" style="s2">terms and the reason I make that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">argument is because I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.650" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">recapitulate the essential Christian</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:43.650" style="s2">message precisely by doing that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:45.090" style="s2">symbolically speaking at least as far as</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.650" end="00:19:47.310" style="s2">I can understand stripped of its</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.090" end="00:19:49.980" style="s2">religious quality of its metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.310" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">context let&#39;s say that the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.980" end="00:19:56.850" style="s2">positing the the the the vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:59.310" style="s2">ideal human being which independent of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.850" end="00:20:01.080" style="s2">the metaphysical context it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.310" end="00:20:03.510" style="s2">what the symbol of Christ represents is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.080" end="00:20:05.490" style="s2">the mode of being that moves us most</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.510" end="00:20:07.140" style="s2">effectively from something approximating</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.490" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">hell to something approximating heaven</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.140" end="00:20:11.250" style="s2">and then part of that part of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:13.080" style="s2">message is and this is also something</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.250" end="00:20:14.970" style="s2">that&#39;s dead along the lines of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.080" end="00:20:17.100" style="s2">you&#39;re arguing is that the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.970" end="00:20:19.890" style="s2">embody that is actually to live in truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.100" end="00:20:22.350" style="s2">I mean so because I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.890" end="00:20:25.500" style="s2">fundamental Christian ethic metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.350" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">accepted once again is to act in love</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.500" end="00:20:29.730" style="s2">which is to assume that being is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:30.130" style="s2">acceptable and can be perfected and to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.730" end="00:20:32.050" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.130" end="00:20:34.270" style="s2">do that with truth and that you should</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.050" end="00:20:36.670" style="s2">embody that and then I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.270" end="00:20:38.440" style="s2">the purpose of the representation we</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.670" end="00:20:40.690" style="s2">could call the meta fictions or our</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.440" end="00:20:43.990" style="s2">archetypal representations is to show</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.690" end="00:20:47.020" style="s2">that is in embodied format so that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.990" end="00:20:49.060" style="s2">can be imitated rather than to transform</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.020" end="00:20:51.460" style="s2">it into something that&#39;s diluted in some</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.060" end="00:20:53.140" style="s2">sense to to an abstract rationality</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.460" end="00:20:55.720" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.140" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">rationality in itself has enough flesh</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.720" end="00:21:00.100" style="s2">on it so to speak which is partly why in</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.100" end="00:21:05.080" style="s2">that the word which is something roughly</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.530" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">akin to rationality has two main has to</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.560" end="00:21:16.630" style="s2">and superstition and other worldliness</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.960" end="00:21:18.730" style="s2">is that part of what gives it its shape</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.630" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">and necessity I think traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.730" end="00:21:23.980" style="s2">historically it has been and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:25.900" style="s2">the problem with religion if you if you</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.900" end="00:21:31.540" style="s2">unjustifiable in the light of 21st</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.840" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">century science and rationality I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.540" end="00:21:36.910" style="s2">you what you have to get down to is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">something quite a bit more Universal and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.910" end="00:21:43.000" style="s2">less provincial than any specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">religion Christianity per se</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.000" end="00:21:46.150" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting too though that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:48.040" style="s2">you know one of the one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.150" end="00:21:53.740" style="s2">one of the points that you do make is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.040" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">that you do appeal to or assume the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.740" end="00:21:59.650" style="s2">existence of a transcendental internal</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">ethics something like that which I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.650" end="00:22:03.610" style="s2">say by the way since we&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:05.380" style="s2">this direction seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.610" end="00:22:07.990" style="s2">something very akin to the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.380" end="00:22:09.820" style="s2">holy spirit which is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.990" end="00:22:11.890" style="s2">internal representation of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.820" end="00:22:13.330" style="s2">transcendent universal ethic now</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.890" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">remember I&#39;m trying to strip these</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:17.380" style="s2">concepts of their metaphysical substrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:19.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not making a case at the moment for</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.380" end="00:22:21.250" style="s2">the existence of the great man in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.390" end="00:22:23.920" style="s2">sky we can we can get to that later I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.250" end="00:22:25.990" style="s2">saying that what what seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.920" end="00:22:27.700" style="s2">case is that we have underneath our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.990" end="00:22:29.950" style="s2">cognitive architecture and our social</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.700" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">architecture a layer of symbolic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:35.530" style="s2">dramatic a narrative representation that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:37.590" style="s2">instantiates the same concepts but but</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.590" end="00:22:42.180" style="s2">context one of the things we talked</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.210" end="00:22:43.720" style="s2">about in Vancouver for example is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.180" end="00:22:46.980" style="s2">the religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.720" end="00:22:50.110" style="s2">enterprise doesn&#39;t only emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.980" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">rationality it it brings music into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.110" end="00:22:55.000" style="s2">play and it brings art into the play and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:57.669" style="s2">it brings drama and it brings literature</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.000" end="00:23:00.789" style="s2">and it brings architecture and it brings</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.669" end="00:23:03.730" style="s2">the the organizing of cities around a</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:12.970" style="s2">simultaneously to me that gives it a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.570" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">richness that cannot be diluted without</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.970" end="00:23:19.330" style="s2">loss and and and also a motive power</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:21.549" style="s2">that that a pure appeal to rationality I</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.330" end="00:23:22.929" style="s2">don&#39;t think can manage and this is see</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.549" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">one of the things this is maybe a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.929" end="00:23:27.130" style="s2">place for Douglas to leap in see one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:28.780" style="s2">the things that Douglas has claimed upon</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.130" end="00:23:30.220" style="s2">multiple occasions to be an atheist and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.780" end="00:23:33.549" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how he&#39;s feeling about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.220" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">at the present time but but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.549" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">matter if one of the things one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">fears</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:42.100" style="s2">Douglas has has pointed out was that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2">there are things that we&#39;ve done in free</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.100" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">countries let&#39;s say broadly speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:49.750" style="s2">the West that are worth protecting and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:52.030" style="s2">that in order to protect them in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.750" end="00:23:56.409" style="s2">longest sense it&#39;s conceivable that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:59.470" style="s2">need a cognitive structure or something</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.409" end="00:24:01.630" style="s2">like that that can act as a bulwark</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.470" end="00:24:04.059" style="s2">against those forces that would seek to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.630" end="00:24:06.039" style="s2">undermine and destroy it and Douglas has</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.059" end="00:24:10.270" style="s2">been driven I would say to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.039" end="00:24:12.520" style="s2">to hypothesize that for Christianity for</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.270" end="00:24:14.650" style="s2">all its faults or we could say</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.520" end="00:24:16.299" style="s2">judeo-christianity to broaden it for all</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.650" end="00:24:18.549" style="s2">its faults might provide something</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.299" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">approximating that bulwark if we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.549" end="00:24:26.130" style="s2">only figure out how to utilize it</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:26.130" style="s2">properly so yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.680" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">I mean one of my problems on this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.070" end="00:24:38.780" style="s2">that it seems that we are where we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:42.410" style="s2">with belief in a whether we wish it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.780" end="00:24:44.510" style="s2">be or not we cannot believe as our</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:48.230" style="s2">predecessors believed even if we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.510" end="00:24:51.830" style="s2">to we know too much more now and it puts</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.230" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">us in this very difficult position but</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.830" end="00:24:58.220" style="s2">to denude ourselves of the entire story</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:25:01.400" style="s2">seems to me to be a fool&#39;s errand for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.220" end="00:25:04.100" style="s2">set of reasons one of which is from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.400" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">lot of travel a lot of speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.100" end="00:25:07.790" style="s2">people from all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.540" end="00:25:09.590" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem at all obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.790" end="00:25:12.980" style="s2">that what we have in countries like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.590" end="00:25:14.900" style="s2">one is the default position of human</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.980" end="00:25:20.470" style="s2">beings in fact it strikes me as being</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.900" end="00:25:23.710" style="s2">very rare order even political order</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.470" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">political liberalism political freedom</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.710" end="00:25:30.470" style="s2">very very unusual things and if you like</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">the things that helps to get you there</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.470" end="00:25:34.550" style="s2">with all of the caveats with all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">caveats we can we could throw in all</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.550" end="00:25:40.040" style="s2">evening and it&#39;s not the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:40.340" style="s2">got us there obviously but that if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.040" end="00:25:43.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.340" end="00:25:45.380" style="s2">broadly speaking where we are you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.280" end="00:25:48.860" style="s2">to be very suspicious at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.380" end="00:25:50.660" style="s2">of saying the whole story is no good we</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.860" end="00:25:53.930" style="s2">don&#39;t need the story we can move on I</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.660" end="00:25:56.360" style="s2">quote quite often the radical theologian</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.930" end="00:26:01.010" style="s2">don cubit it was often described as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.360" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">atheist priest and cupid so somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.010" end="00:26:04.580" style="s2">the recent book he said you know we</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:06.740" style="s2">can&#39;t help it he said for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.580" end="00:26:10.160" style="s2">dreams we dream are still Christian</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.740" end="00:26:14.270" style="s2">dreams whether we like that fact or not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.160" end="00:26:16.130" style="s2">and without being able to believe myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:21.260" style="s2">certainly not being able to be a literal</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.130" end="00:26:24.230" style="s2">believer I worry yeah I worry about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:27.950" style="s2">happens when the square is denuded</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.230" end="00:26:29.870" style="s2">completely and that&#39;s why this</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.950" end="00:26:31.880" style="s2">discussions an item you to in particular</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.870" end="00:26:34.540" style="s2">a ride on the cusp of this because this</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.880" end="00:26:38.210" style="s2">is this is where I think a lot of us ah</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.540" end="00:26:40.430" style="s2">even if we really wanted to believe we</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.210" end="00:26:43.059" style="s2">basically can&#39;t and by the way very</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.430" end="00:26:45.249" style="s2">quickly that&#39;s why I think there&#39;s Anna</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.059" end="00:26:47.259" style="s2">channel just to refine my previous point</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.249" end="00:26:49.450" style="s2">to you Sam that&#39;s why there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.259" end="00:26:51.190" style="s2">additional thing I think there is a fear</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.450" end="00:26:54.460" style="s2">which you may have which I also have</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.190" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">which is if there&#39;s a risk that even</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">what I&#39;ve just said never mind what</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:01.029" style="s2">Jordan has also said there&#39;s a risk I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:04.299" style="s2">think some people feel or that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.029" end="00:27:07.330" style="s2">going to soften up the land somehow and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.299" end="00:27:09.309" style="s2">that even if neither Jordan nor I are</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.330" end="00:27:12.850" style="s2">going to suddenly start Jesus smuggling</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.309" end="00:27:14.759" style="s2">we might create the conditions that make</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.850" end="00:27:15.940" style="s2">it easier for someone else to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.759" end="00:27:23.289" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.940" end="00:27:34.659" style="s2">is that a fair yeah and it is no photos</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.289" end="00:27:36.549" style="s2">is very pristine of you so thank you let</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.659" end="00:27:38.230" style="s2">me see if I can sharpen up what my</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.549" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">concern actually is here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.230" end="00:27:42.970" style="s2">not even true to say that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:49.450" style="s2">need to get rid of the Jesus story or</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.970" end="00:27:51.369" style="s2">even or even not hey I don&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.450" end="00:27:54.340" style="s2">there&#39;s something problematic with or</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.369" end="00:27:56.259" style="s2">aunt in your life around the Jesus story</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.340" end="00:27:58.899" style="s2">I think that that can be reclaimed but</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.259" end="00:28:01.259" style="s2">so for instance I was walking yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.899" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">and this fine City of yours and saw</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.259" end="00:28:07.809" style="s2">someone on the sidewalk giving tarot</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:09.309" style="s2">readings to people you know the tarot</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.309" end="00:28:13.509" style="s2">spread out and he was soliciting people</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:16.840" style="s2">and and I&#39;m sorry to say I didn&#39;t sit</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.509" end="00:28:18.759" style="s2">for a reading but you know two tarot</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.840" end="00:28:21.549" style="s2">cards if you&#39;re familiar with them are</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.759" end="00:28:24.039" style="s2">they&#39;ve got the quintessential artifact</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.549" end="00:28:26.769" style="s2">of New Age whoo right I mean these are</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.039" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">not you thought of as legitimate tools</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.769" end="00:28:31.119" style="s2">of divination except by people who think</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:36.279" style="s2">that there are legitimate tools of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.119" end="00:28:39.100" style="s2">divination and yet a tarot reading can</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.279" end="00:28:41.049" style="s2">be truly powerful right I mean is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.100" end="00:28:46.090" style="s2">the this is built on something right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.049" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">this is not just a a massive example of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.090" end="00:28:49.749" style="s2">self deception on the part of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:53.980" style="s2">reading and people getting their cards</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.749" end="00:28:55.870" style="s2">read it these cards can seem prescient I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.980" end="00:29:00.610" style="s2">could give you all a reading</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.870" end="00:29:03.309" style="s2">now and 95% of you would find what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.610" end="00:29:04.930" style="s2">would what the cards would say to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.309" end="00:29:07.240" style="s2">relevant to your lives I could do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.930" end="00:29:08.770" style="s2">with an imaginary deck I&#39;m an invisible</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.240" end="00:29:10.150" style="s2">imaginary deck I don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.770" end="00:29:13.960" style="s2">about tarot cards but I&#39;m going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.150" end="00:29:16.630" style="s2">over to cards now one is the Sun and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.960" end="00:29:18.430" style="s2">other is the the fallen man now I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.630" end="00:29:21.670" style="s2">so little about Tarot that I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.430" end="00:29:23.500" style="s2">sure the Fallen man is a tarot card or I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.670" end="00:29:26.830" style="s2">think was the hanged man that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.500" end="00:29:28.540" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ve got these two cards and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.830" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">know the Sun is clearly the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.540" end="00:29:33.940" style="s2">representation of wisdom right and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:36.820" style="s2">Hang demand is the is the representation</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.940" end="00:29:38.620" style="s2">of lost opportunity and I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.820" end="00:29:40.120" style="s2">with some degree of certainty that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.620" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">of you are at a crossroads in your life</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.120" end="00:29:46.600" style="s2">right where you have you you have good</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">reason to believe that you&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.600" end="00:29:51.010" style="s2">the most of your opportunities right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:54.910" style="s2">I could go on like this for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.010" end="00:29:57.309" style="s2">right and pretend all the while that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.910" end="00:30:00.280" style="s2">has something to do with the car it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.309" end="00:30:02.470" style="s2">actually being working in concert with</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.280" end="00:30:05.650" style="s2">the dynamics of the cosmos such that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.470" end="00:30:09.130" style="s2">these cards that I turn over were they</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.650" end="00:30:10.660" style="s2">real would be the ones that knew of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.130" end="00:30:12.370" style="s2">necessity we&#39;re revealing something</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.660" end="00:30:14.470" style="s2">about your mind in this moment and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.370" end="00:30:17.080" style="s2">obviously people think in these terms</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.470" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">about astrology and sympathetic magic</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.080" end="00:30:22.600" style="s2">and all the rest and religion is built</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">upon this kind of superstition there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.600" end="00:30:28.570" style="s2">way of understanding the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:30.580" style="s2">using a device like this and the real</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.570" end="00:30:32.740" style="s2">effect it has on you I mean if I turn</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.580" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">over the cards and ask you to look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.740" end="00:30:36.820" style="s2">your life in this moment as though for</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:38.410" style="s2">the first time through this lens</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.820" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">considering in this case lost</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.410" end="00:30:45.040" style="s2">opportunities right of course it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.980" end="00:30:48.070" style="s2">to be valid that doesn&#39;t make it could</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.040" end="00:30:51.790" style="s2">be an incredibly useful thing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.070" end="00:30:54.670" style="s2">met my main concern is that at no point</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.790" end="00:30:56.590" style="s2">you have to lie to yourself about your</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.670" end="00:30:58.300" style="s2">state of knowledge about the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.590" end="00:31:00.670" style="s2">right you don&#39;t have to believe tarot</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.300" end="00:31:02.950" style="s2">cards really were there there&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.670" end="00:31:05.170" style="s2">deeper mechanisms that work with someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.950" end="00:31:07.179" style="s2">who&#39;s actually good at that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.170" end="00:31:09.090" style="s2">agree with what you said but they need</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.179" end="00:31:10.800" style="s2">not be super national income</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.090" end="00:31:12.420" style="s2">supernatural and in fact I think what</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.800" end="00:31:13.710" style="s2">happens when you use a projective</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.420" end="00:31:16.500" style="s2">technique like that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.710" end="00:31:18.090" style="s2">essentially what it is if I&#39;m good at</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.500" end="00:31:20.160" style="s2">interpersonal attunement and I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.090" end="00:31:21.510" style="s2">intuitive what I&#39;m going to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.160" end="00:31:24.290" style="s2">everyone does this in the course of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.510" end="00:31:26.490" style="s2">dialogue that&#39;s actually working well</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.290" end="00:31:28.590" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna flip over the cards and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.490" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">gonna start with generic archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.590" end="00:31:32.400" style="s2">statements that are that are true in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:34.380" style="s2">some sense for everyone but then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.400" end="00:31:36.570" style="s2">gonna watch you both consciously and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.380" end="00:31:38.550" style="s2">implicitly unconsciously with all of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.570" end="00:31:42.090" style="s2">social intelligence and I&#39;m going to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.550" end="00:31:44.850" style="s2">through very very subtle signs on your</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.090" end="00:31:46.350" style="s2">part when you respond positively to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.850" end="00:31:47.700" style="s2">I&#39;m saying and when you respond</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.350" end="00:31:50.460" style="s2">negatively and I&#39;m going to continue</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.700" end="00:31:51.810" style="s2">down the lines that you establish by</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.460" end="00:31:53.280" style="s2">your positive responses that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.810" end="00:31:54.900" style="s2">sherrod Brown does that&#39;s he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.280" end="00:31:56.610" style="s2">mentally right well it&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.900" end="00:31:58.260" style="s2">happens when children are interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.610" end="00:32:00.900" style="s2">for example by people who lead them as</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.260" end="00:32:02.730" style="s2">witnesses right the children infer from</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.900" end="00:32:04.740" style="s2">the emotional expressions of the person</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.730" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">who&#39;s interrogating them what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.740" end="00:32:08.310" style="s2">they actually want to hear and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:10.470" style="s2">they&#39;ll be even work with that horse</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.310" end="00:32:12.630" style="s2">clever huh exactly right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:15.510" style="s2">exactly horses can do this so tarot card</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.630" end="00:32:19.170" style="s2">readers can definitely do this oh so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.510" end="00:32:20.580" style="s2">they so so so the the mechanisms behind</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.170" end="00:32:22.560" style="s2">something like that even if it appears</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.580" end="00:32:24.300" style="s2">entirely superstitious on the surface</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.560" end="00:32:27.270" style="s2">are often deeper than is revealed at</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.300" end="00:32:29.520" style="s2">first approximation so and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.270" end="00:32:32.180" style="s2">talk a little bit if you don&#39;t mind for</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.520" end="00:32:36.180" style="s2">a minute about rationality because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.180" end="00:32:38.840" style="s2">the we&#39;ve already agreed I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.180" end="00:32:40.800" style="s2">definitely start me if I&#39;m wrong that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.840" end="00:32:42.600" style="s2">there has to be an intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.800" end="00:32:44.970" style="s2">mechanism between the world of facts and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.600" end="00:32:47.100" style="s2">the world of values and well since we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.970" end="00:32:49.530" style="s2">talked I&#39;ve been reading a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.100" end="00:32:50.910" style="s2">commentaries on Immanuel Kant mostly</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.530" end="00:32:54.060" style="s2">these have been written by Roger Scruton</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.910" end="00:32:58.710" style="s2">by the way and this is actually that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.060" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">the issue that they can&#39;t what obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.710" end="00:33:03.170" style="s2">about for most of his philosophical life</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:04.980" style="s2">and what he concluded was that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.170" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">empiricism can&#39;t be right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.980" end="00:33:08.520" style="s2">rationality can&#39;t be right as</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:10.500" style="s2">philosophical disciplines because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.520" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">need an intermediary structure that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.500" end="00:33:13.980" style="s2">that we have an inbuilt intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:16.590" style="s2">structure and that structure is what</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.980" end="00:33:19.110" style="s2">mediates between the thing in itself the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.590" end="00:33:22.380" style="s2">world of facts let&#39;s say and the outputs</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.110" end="00:33:24.150" style="s2">the values so then I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.380" end="00:33:26.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t quite agree on this I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.150" end="00:33:27.870" style="s2">my summary of your overview of me I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.040" end="00:33:30.060" style="s2">would have agreed with that but for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.870" end="00:33:32.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just facts all the way down okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.060" end="00:33:34.710" style="s2">you&#39;re great you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.210" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">glad to hear it then why do you need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.710" end="00:33:40.560" style="s2">bring them well both but brain is yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">another part of reality I mean without</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.560" end="00:33:46.590" style="s2">what I mean by a fact what is do</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:47.670" style="s2">anything there what does the brain do it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.590" end="00:33:55.790" style="s2">has to do something because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.670" end="00:33:59.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t need it it does a lot the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.790" end="00:34:00.420" style="s2">immensity your concern to the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.160" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">where I think we&#39;re going in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.420" end="00:34:06.900" style="s2">conversation is how is it that values</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:08.929" style="s2">can be another order of fact that seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.900" end="00:34:11.879" style="s2">problematic to you it seems problematic</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.929" end="00:34:14.580" style="s2">about you well it&#39;s problematic for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.879" end="00:34:17.159" style="s2">for a technical reason which is that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.580" end="00:34:19.860" style="s2">order to app you know and we see if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.159" end="00:34:24.750" style="s2">agree on this in order to perceive and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.860" end="00:34:28.020" style="s2">to act which I believe are both acts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.750" end="00:34:29.460" style="s2">value to perceive as an active value</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.020" end="00:34:31.290" style="s2">because you have to look at something</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.460" end="00:34:33.240" style="s2">instead of a bunch of other things so</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.290" end="00:34:35.399" style="s2">you have you elevate the thing that</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.659" end="00:34:44.700" style="s2">development I just that gets translated</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:46.500" style="s2">in my brain into just more facts just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.700" end="00:34:48.600" style="s2">give me the facts of human perception</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.500" end="00:34:49.050" style="s2">well that&#39;s fine that&#39;s that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.600" end="00:34:51.030" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.050" end="00:34:53.730" style="s2">I&#39;m perfectly happy about that and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.030" end="00:34:56.129" style="s2">in order to act you have to select the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.730" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">target of action from among an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.129" end="00:35:01.620" style="s2">number near infinite number close enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">of possible mechanisms of action and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.620" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">what a biological organism does is take</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">the facts and translate them into</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:11.940" style="s2">perception and action and the only</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:15.300" style="s2">organisms that do that with one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.940" end="00:35:17.730" style="s2">mapping are organisms that are composed</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.300" end="00:35:19.380" style="s2">of sensory motor cells like sponges</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">marine sponges which are composed of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.380" end="00:35:23.250" style="s2">sensory motor cells they don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:24.870" style="s2">intermediary nervous system so what they</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.250" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">do is they sit in the water they make a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.870" end="00:35:28.620" style="s2">sponge they&#39;re so simple that if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:29.700" style="s2">grind the sponge through a sieve and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.620" end="00:35:31.620" style="s2">in salt water</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.700" end="00:35:34.380" style="s2">it&#39;ll reorganize itself into this sponge</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.620" end="00:35:34.830" style="s2">so that&#39;s quite cool the sponge sits in</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.380" end="00:35:35.460" style="s2">the water</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.830" end="00:35:38.780" style="s2">don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.460" end="00:35:41.940" style="s2">and what it does and what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.780" end="00:35:44.730" style="s2">there&#39;s waves on it and so it those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.940" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">patterns and then the sponge opens and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.730" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">closes pours on its surface in response</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:51.300" style="s2">to those patterns so it Maps the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">of the waves right on to its behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.300" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">with no intermediary of a nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.260" style="s2">but it&#39;s it can only map waves that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">all it can do and it can only open and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.260" end="00:36:01.589" style="s2">close pores</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:03.810" style="s2">that&#39;s it so it does one-to-one fact to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.589" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">value mapping now what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.810" end="00:36:09.810" style="s2">as the as the complexity of a biological</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:11.460" style="s2">organism increases two things happen the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.810" end="00:36:13.890" style="s2">first thing that happens is that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.460" end="00:36:15.890" style="s2">sensory and motor cells differentiate so</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.890" end="00:36:18.930" style="s2">now the organism has sensory cells and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.890" end="00:36:22.260" style="s2">motor cells so scent senses to detect</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.930" end="00:36:25.650" style="s2">and senses and sorry cells to detect and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.260" end="00:36:27.270" style="s2">cells to act ok so then it can do it can</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.650" end="00:36:28.920" style="s2">detect more patterns because it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.270" end="00:36:30.510" style="s2">sophisticated at the sensory port</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.920" end="00:36:33.480" style="s2">perspective and it could do more things</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.510" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">because it has specialized motor systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.480" end="00:36:37.830" style="s2">but then what happens is that as it gets</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">even more complex then it puts an</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.830" end="00:36:42.359" style="s2">intermediary structure of nervous tissue</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:44.550" style="s2">in there and that structure increases in</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.359" end="00:36:47.670" style="s2">the number of layers of neurons and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.550" end="00:36:49.560" style="s2">that means is that as as that happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.670" end="00:36:51.000" style="s2">and as the sensory cells become more</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.560" end="00:36:54.030" style="s2">specialized and as the motor output</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.000" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">cells become more specialized many more</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.030" end="00:36:58.170" style="s2">patterns can be detected those are</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">roughly equivalent to facts and many</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.170" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">more motor outputs can be manifested but</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:05.880" style="s2">a tremendous number of calculations have</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:08.130" style="s2">to has to occur in that intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.880" end="00:37:10.200" style="s2">nervous tissue and that&#39;s the structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.130" end="00:37:12.150" style="s2">that I&#39;m talking about that structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.200" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">exists and it translates the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.150" end="00:37:15.780" style="s2">into motor output and it doesn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:18.630" style="s2">on a one-to-one basis because there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.780" end="00:37:21.060" style="s2">more patterns more facts then there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.630" end="00:37:23.550" style="s2">motor outputs so what has to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.060" end="00:37:25.859" style="s2">this tremendous plethora of facts that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.550" end="00:37:27.570" style="s2">surrounds us has to be filtered to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.859" end="00:37:30.210" style="s2">point where you pick a single action</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.570" end="00:37:33.060" style="s2">because you can tap act otherwise and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.210" end="00:37:35.400" style="s2">the mechanism that reduces the number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.060" end="00:37:37.020" style="s2">facts to the selected action is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.400" end="00:37:40.020" style="s2">mechanism that mediates between facts</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.020" end="00:37:43.109" style="s2">and values and it&#39;s not simply in and of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.020" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">itself it&#39;s a fact that that exists but</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.109" end="00:37:47.910" style="s2">it isn&#39;t as simple that what it does</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:49.319" style="s2">isn&#39;t a simple fact you can&#39;t it you</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.499" end="00:38:07.349" style="s2">network notice there&#39;s a distinction</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.250" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">detecting the world of facts and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.690" end="00:40:57.630" style="s2">have your motor output system which is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:40:58.830" style="s2">very narrow channel because you can only</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.630" end="00:41:00.780" style="s2">do one thing at a time</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.830" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things about</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.780" end="00:41:04.170" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s quite strange it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:05.910" style="s2">a very very narrow channel so you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.170" end="00:41:07.830" style="s2">to take this unbelievably complex world</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.910" end="00:41:11.160" style="s2">and you have to channel it into this</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.830" end="00:41:12.869" style="s2">very narrow channel and you you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.160" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">that by being wrong about the world but</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.869" end="00:41:17.160" style="s2">you do do that by ignoring a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:19.410" style="s2">world and by using representations that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.160" end="00:41:21.060" style="s2">are no more complicated than they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.410" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">to be in order to attain the task at</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.060" end="00:41:25.260" style="s2">hand it&#39;s like you&#39;re losing using low</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:27.270" style="s2">resolution representations of the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.260" end="00:41:29.010" style="s2">they&#39;re not inaccurate because a low</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.270" end="00:41:30.900" style="s2">resolution representation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.010" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t inaccurate anymore than a low</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.900" end="00:41:34.530" style="s2">resolution photo is but they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:35.880" style="s2">higher resolution than they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.530" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">in order for you to undertake the task</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.880" end="00:41:40.050" style="s2">at hand and if you undertake the task at</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:41.580" style="s2">hand and that goes successfully then</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.050" end="00:41:43.830" style="s2">what you&#39;ve done and this is basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.580" end="00:41:46.200" style="s2">the essence of American pragmatism what</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.830" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve done is validated the you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.200" end="00:41:50.070" style="s2">validated the validity of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.109" style="s2">simplifications so if the tool you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.070" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">in hand is good if the acts you have in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.109" end="00:41:56.670" style="s2">hand is sharp enough to chop down the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.140" style="s2">tree then it&#39;s a good enough axe and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.670" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the way that we define</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.140" end="00:42:02.580" style="s2">truth pragmatically in the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:04.350" style="s2">infinite knowledge about everything okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.580" end="00:42:06.330" style="s2">so now you build up this nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.350" end="00:42:08.220" style="s2">between the world of facts and the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.330" end="00:42:09.720" style="s2">of values and it and it narrows the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.220" end="00:42:11.580" style="s2">world of facts and the question then is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.720" end="00:42:13.590" style="s2">how do you generate the mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.580" end="00:42:15.930" style="s2">does that narrowing and this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.590" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">useful that&#39;s not quite how the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.930" end="00:42:20.820" style="s2">the cake is layered what because the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:22.710" style="s2">facts are up here to write it for me -</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.820" end="00:42:25.350" style="s2">for me to even notice that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.710" end="00:42:27.360" style="s2">person right or to attribute beliefs to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.350" end="00:42:29.970" style="s2">you or to have a sense of being in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.360" end="00:42:33.330" style="s2">relationship at all this is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.970" end="00:42:35.550" style="s2">higher-order interpretive acts based on</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.330" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">a many layered nervous system yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.550" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">not only bottom-up yeah yeah but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:44.520" style="s2">it&#39;s bottom-up and top-down yes and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:45.990" style="s2">but fat but facts are also on the top</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.520" end="00:42:48.810" style="s2">right it&#39;s not that we have facts here</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.990" end="00:42:53.880" style="s2">and values here it&#39;s it&#39;s well I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.810" end="00:42:55.800" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do I think maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.880" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">one way of thinking about it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.800" end="00:43:00.270" style="s2">you are using you&#39;re positing that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:02.280" style="s2">can use rationality as a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.270" end="00:43:04.020" style="s2">mediating between facts and values I</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.280" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">believe because otherwise there&#39;s no use</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.020" end="00:43:07.740" style="s2">for rationality we can just have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:10.530" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s a process even simpler</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.740" end="00:43:12.510" style="s2">than that it&#39;s just that for me and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.530" end="00:43:15.890" style="s2">think for everyone if they will only</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.510" end="00:43:19.260" style="s2">agree to use language this way for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.890" end="00:43:21.630" style="s2">values are simply facts about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.260" end="00:43:23.850" style="s2">experience of conscious creatures good</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.630" end="00:43:26.010" style="s2">and bad experiences give us our values</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.850" end="00:43:27.630" style="s2">yeah but they&#39;re not simple that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.010" end="00:43:29.160" style="s2">little bit but there are the goods in</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.630" end="00:43:31.470" style="s2">the balance some are very simple you</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.160" end="00:43:34.350" style="s2">have in your hand put on a hot stove</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.470" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">he&#39;s incredibly simple any notice it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.350" end="00:43:43.560" style="s2">save your child if you do it well but</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:45.180" style="s2">again put the unpleasantness of it no no</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.560" end="00:43:47.010" style="s2">no it&#39;s not if you look at the way the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.180" end="00:43:48.780" style="s2">reward and Punishment systems work in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.010" end="00:43:51.030" style="s2">the brain you can easily train an animal</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.780" end="00:43:52.920" style="s2">using reward to wag its tail if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.030" end="00:43:54.750" style="s2">being shocked electrically you can do</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.920" end="00:43:56.820" style="s2">that and you can wire it very low to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.750" end="00:44:00.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a range of unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.820" end="00:44:02.400" style="s2">experiences we can have where we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.150" end="00:44:03.840" style="s2">construe them as pleasant or necessary</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.400" end="00:44:08.280" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a kind of a higher</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.840" end="00:44:09.930" style="s2">level issue but I&#39;m talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.280" end="00:44:11.670" style="s2">know the worst possible sensory</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.930" end="00:44:14.820" style="s2">experience that all of us will greet</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:17.880" style="s2">will agree is unpleasant right that</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.820" end="00:44:20.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require a story to for us to</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.880" end="00:44:21.660" style="s2">feel aversion to and there&#39;s there many</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.370" end="00:44:24.090" style="s2">things like that in life that are just</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.660" end="00:44:27.030" style="s2">just rudimentary where&#39;s just we are we</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.090" end="00:44:29.329" style="s2">are organized in such a way that you put</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.030" end="00:44:31.459" style="s2">us into fire we like it so are you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.329" end="00:44:33.650" style="s2">are you claiming then like this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.459" end="00:44:35.569" style="s2">another problem this is where I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.650" end="00:44:39.229" style="s2">that the argument that you make</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.569" end="00:44:41.209" style="s2">although accurate in its rudiments let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.229" end="00:44:42.769" style="s2">say is in sufficiently high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.209" end="00:44:45.009" style="s2">because now it sounds to me like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.769" end="00:44:47.180" style="s2">including the domain of qualia</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.009" end="00:44:49.309" style="s2">unquestioningly in the domain of facts</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.180" end="00:44:50.420" style="s2">now you can do that and but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.309" end="00:44:52.279" style="s2">know if that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.420" end="00:44:52.519" style="s2">what are these facts you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.279" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.519" end="00:44:56.420" style="s2">are they mere manifestations of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:58.719" style="s2">objective world or do they shade into</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.420" end="00:45:02.209" style="s2">the subject that there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.719" end="00:45:04.729" style="s2">objective facts of joy about subjective</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.209" end="00:45:07.249" style="s2">experience so yeah I can make I can make</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.729" end="00:45:10.309" style="s2">true or false claims about your</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.249" end="00:45:11.509" style="s2">subjectivity and and you can make you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.309" end="00:45:13.039" style="s2">can make those about your own</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.509" end="00:45:15.229" style="s2">subjectivity right you can be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.039" end="00:45:18.440" style="s2">about your own subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.229" end="00:45:20.809" style="s2">we&#39;re not subjectively incorrigible and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.440" end="00:45:22.249" style="s2">I might have said this last time in</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.809" end="00:45:25.579" style="s2">Vancouver I mean whether the example I</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.249" end="00:45:29.390" style="s2">often use here is to speculate about</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.579" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">what JFK was thinking the moment he got</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.390" end="00:45:36.680" style="s2">shot right is not a completely vacuous</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.849" end="00:45:38.989" style="s2">exercise they&#39;re literally an infinite</p>

<p begin="00:45:38.989" end="00:45:44.539" style="s2">thinking right so we make claims about</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.420" end="00:45:46.999" style="s2">his conscious mind and at that moment in</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.539" end="00:45:48.709" style="s2">history which are a scientific even</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.999" end="00:45:51.799" style="s2">though the data are unavailable I said</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.709" end="00:45:53.900" style="s2">many people get confused between having</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.799" end="00:45:55.640" style="s2">answers in practice and they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.900" end="00:46:00.469" style="s2">answers in principle there there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.640" end="00:46:02.089" style="s2">many trivial fact-based claims we could</p>

<p begin="00:46:04.369" end="00:46:08.059" style="s2">so you know do you have an even or odd</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.229" end="00:46:10.069" style="s2">number of hairs on your body at this</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.059" end="00:46:11.150" style="s2">moment you know we you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.069" end="00:46:13.219" style="s2">want to think about what it would take</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.150" end="00:46:17.029" style="s2">to ascertain that fact right but there</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.219" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">is a fact of the matter right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.029" end="00:46:20.809" style="s2">it is with anything but so what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:23.209" style="s2">somebody what is a person way there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.809" end="00:46:25.400" style="s2">many many facts are blurry because you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.209" end="00:46:28.099" style="s2">gave your gonna way way down to the the</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.099" end="00:46:32.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like at a certain point you were</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.630" end="00:46:34.449" style="s2">going to be rounding and someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.359" end="00:46:36.069" style="s2">weight at that point is changing every</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.469" end="00:46:42.559" style="s2">there are facts that can be loosely</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.150" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">defined</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.559" end="00:46:49.380" style="s2">this is still this is true of our</p>

<p begin="00:48:04.769" end="00:48:10.140" style="s2">make here is I think to try to increase</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.589" end="00:48:12.990" style="s2">the what would you call the breadth of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.140" end="00:48:16.259" style="s2">the conversation about how facts get</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.490" end="00:48:24.420" style="s2">what surprised me so much about your</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:27.180" style="s2">thinking when I first encountered it see</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.420" end="00:48:29.220" style="s2">I think the manner in which facts are</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.180" end="00:48:31.619" style="s2">translated into values is something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.220" end="00:48:33.569" style="s2">actually evolved and it evolved over</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.619" end="00:48:35.309" style="s2">three and a half billion years the three</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.569" end="00:48:37.049" style="s2">and a half billion years of life and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.309" end="00:48:39.059" style="s2">built the nervous system from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.049" end="00:48:40.650" style="s2">up and it built this reducing mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.059" end="00:48:42.690" style="s2">that takes the infinite number of facts</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.650" end="00:48:44.819" style="s2">and translates them into a single value</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.690" end="00:48:46.769" style="s2">per action and it does that in layers</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.819" end="00:48:48.809" style="s2">and so there is a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.769" end="00:48:51.329" style="s2">the world of facts and the world of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.809" end="00:48:53.789" style="s2">values and there has to be but it isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:03.630" style="s2">that well yeah if there&#39;s more to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.579" end="00:49:06.329" style="s2">than rationality yes I mean right again</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.630" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not rationality that causes you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.329" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">remove your hand from a hot stove and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not rationality that causes you to</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:21.859" style="s2">and rapture and creativity over or more</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.430" end="00:49:24.150" style="s2">than pointless misery and and despair</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.859" end="00:49:27.150" style="s2">things other than rationality are</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.150" end="00:49:28.859" style="s2">clearly necessary absolutely okay the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.150" end="00:49:31.349" style="s2">question is do we ever have to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.859" end="00:49:33.630" style="s2">irrational to get the good things in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.349" end="00:49:35.670" style="s2">life and I would argue that that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.630" end="00:49:39.329" style="s2">answer to does clearly no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.670" end="00:49:41.700" style="s2">nothing irrational about loving your</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.329" end="00:49:45.749" style="s2">wife or your best friend or yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.700" end="00:49:49.230" style="s2">even a stranger if what you mean by love</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.749" end="00:49:52.259" style="s2">there is genuinely wanting happiness for</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.230" end="00:49:55.230" style="s2">that person genuinely taking pleasure in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.259" end="00:49:59.279" style="s2">their company genuinely wanting to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.230" end="00:50:01.140" style="s2">find a way of being where you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.279" end="00:50:03.660" style="s2">longer in a zero-sum condition with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.140" end="00:50:05.640" style="s2">stranger or with a partner but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.660" end="00:50:08.789" style="s2">you&#39;re collaborating together to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.640" end="00:50:10.200" style="s2">better lives what&#39;s in it so rationality</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.789" end="00:50:12.180" style="s2">moves through that situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.200" end="00:50:14.579" style="s2">continuously because rationality is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.180" end="00:50:16.529" style="s2">only way that you and I can get our</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.579" end="00:50:19.049" style="s2">representations of the world to cohere</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.529" end="00:50:21.150" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s when I say okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.049" end="00:50:23.849" style="s2">there&#39;s a lion behind that rock don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.150" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">over there that only that that only</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.849" end="00:50:27.420" style="s2">makes sense to you if you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:29.249" style="s2">this rationality game the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.420" end="00:50:31.559" style="s2">playing it if I mean something else by</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.249" end="00:50:33.539" style="s2">lion or I mean something else by don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.559" end="00:50:37.559" style="s2">go over there you know you&#39;re confused</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.539" end="00:50:39.420" style="s2">and very likely dead or not if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.559" end="00:50:41.759" style="s2">trying to establish the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.420" end="00:50:44.099" style="s2">rationality is the mechanism by which we</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.759" end="00:50:46.710" style="s2">make our worldviews cohere I would agree</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.099" end="00:50:48.119" style="s2">with that in part we also make them cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.710" end="00:50:49.559" style="s2">here because we&#39;re actually biologically</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.119" end="00:50:51.299" style="s2">structured the same way and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.559" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">proclivity for them to go here to begin</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.299" end="00:50:53.489" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:54.930" style="s2">but we iron out our differences through</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.489" end="00:50:56.519" style="s2">the exercise I wouldn&#39;t call it</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.930" end="00:50:58.470" style="s2">rationality I would call it logos</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.519" end="00:51:00.269" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s a more incorp it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.470" end="00:51:05.430" style="s2">a it&#39;s a broader and that is where you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.269" end="00:51:08.280" style="s2">smuggling at Jesus yeah unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.430" end="00:51:11.730" style="s2">let&#39;s say so I&#39;d like it is the point of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.280" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">order here I wanna I&#39;m I&#39;m disconcerted</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.730" end="00:51:16.440" style="s2">by Douglas asylum yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:18.260" style="s2">no I want to pivot because I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.440" end="00:51:20.760" style="s2">how good he is when he actually speaks</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.260" end="00:51:23.309" style="s2">so I want to pivot to another subject</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.760" end="00:51:24.900" style="s2">because we can return to this we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.309" end="00:51:27.000" style="s2">first before you pivot</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.900" end="00:51:29.640" style="s2">I mean having said to you what I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.000" end="00:51:31.859" style="s2">your concern is with Jordan I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.640" end="00:51:33.619" style="s2">strikes me that Jordans concern and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.859" end="00:51:36.050" style="s2">share this just as I share some of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.619" end="00:51:38.910" style="s2">concern that we expressed at the outset</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.050" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">in Jordan&#39;s fundamental concern it seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.910" end="00:51:49.770" style="s2">to me is a 1 I fundamentally share which</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:53.460" style="s2">is rationalism isn&#39;t enough and it&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.770" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">let me put it another way can you both</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.460" end="00:51:58.890" style="s2">show me where it where it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:01.230" style="s2">insufficient like more like music but</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.890" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s nothing but again so to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.230" end="00:52:06.420" style="s2">that it&#39;s not to say that there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:09.300" style="s2">to life than being rational is not to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.420" end="00:52:11.460" style="s2">say and perhaps never to say you need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.300" end="00:52:13.230" style="s2">run against rationality you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.460" end="00:52:15.059" style="s2">irrational in order to get something</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.230" end="00:52:16.819" style="s2">good let me express it a different way</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.059" end="00:52:20.190" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.819" end="00:52:22.980" style="s2">we haven&#39;t tried the purely rational</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.190" end="00:52:25.770" style="s2">approach yet we have applied it for very</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.980" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">long well many of us have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.770" end="00:52:31.559" style="s2">for a couple of centuries at least which</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:35.130" style="s2">is a blip yeah I mean the tiniest dot at</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.559" end="00:52:37.020" style="s2">the end of human evolution so I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.130" end="00:52:39.630" style="s2">that a concern which Jordan has in</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.020" end="00:52:43.530" style="s2">certainly concern I have is if we try</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.630" end="00:52:45.869" style="s2">this we can think of all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.530" end="00:52:47.910" style="s2">in which you can go wrong if you take</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.869" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">away all that&#39;s a supporting structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.910" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">you can think of any number of ways in</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:56.030" style="s2">which you can go wrong and that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.000" end="00:52:58.470" style="s2">suppose that that&#39;s at the root of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.030" end="00:53:02.130" style="s2">the concern about where you might be</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.470" end="00:53:03.540" style="s2">taking us or to put it another way if we</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.130" end="00:53:06.450" style="s2">enter the world that you would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.540" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">not everyone may necessarily come out as</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.450" end="00:53:12.569" style="s2">sam Harris okay give me one way where</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:15.690" style="s2">you think it can go wrong and again this</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.569" end="00:53:22.380" style="s2">we can&#39;t forget your caveat would you</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.690" end="00:53:24.030" style="s2">start it with very smart person so then</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.380" end="00:53:26.010" style="s2">you&#39;re basically saying that the stupid</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.030" end="00:53:27.510" style="s2">people need their myths you know we</p>

<p begin="00:53:29.970" end="00:53:33.930" style="s2">looked I actually am saying that to some</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.930" end="00:53:52.619" style="s2">and so it is definitely the case and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.760" end="00:53:54.930" style="s2">this has been and what would you call a</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:06.390" style="s2">generally speaking doing what everyone</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.200" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">else does is the path of least error</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.390" end="00:54:10.589" style="s2">moving forward now that doesn&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.589" end="00:54:13.950" style="s2">does it mean little conservative the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.089" end="00:54:17.670" style="s2">stupid it doesn&#39;t mean that either right</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.950" end="00:54:19.619" style="s2">precisely it doesn&#39;t mean a bit but all</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.670" end="00:54:23.420" style="s2">conservative structures are not the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.619" end="00:54:25.380" style="s2">either and that we have many warring and</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.589" end="00:54:40.380" style="s2">definitely the case that we it&#39;s to take</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.000" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">Douglass&#39;s point that we need to be</p>

<p begin="00:54:52.140" end="00:54:57.510" style="s2">describes the tragedy of the clergy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.630" end="00:55:00.089" style="s2">he pretty much he pretty much says look</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.510" end="00:55:02.670" style="s2">if they don&#39;t believe it they recognize</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.089" end="00:55:05.309" style="s2">it&#39;s a very useful metaphor but they</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.670" end="00:55:06.839" style="s2">don&#39;t need to believe it it&#39;s they tell</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.309" end="00:55:08.040" style="s2">it and he says the tragedy of the clergy</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.839" end="00:55:09.720" style="s2">is they can never admit that what</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.040" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">they&#39;re saying is just a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.720" end="00:55:14.550" style="s2">right this is our for or after he threw</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.570" end="00:55:26.820" style="s2">there is a way in which religion is what</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.380" end="00:55:29.160" style="s2">he describes as philosophy for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.820" end="00:55:30.360" style="s2">masses and that if you recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.160" end="00:55:31.800" style="s2">most people are not going to spend their</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.730" end="00:55:42.750" style="s2">particularly but there&#39;s a heck of an</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.430" end="00:55:50.250" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good argument if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.830" end="00:55:52.140" style="s2">will recall or I just - just imagine</p>

<p begin="00:55:52.140" end="00:55:53.910" style="s2">especially from the perspective of being</p>

<p begin="00:55:53.910" end="00:56:01.530" style="s2">I mean you know I have two young girls</p>

<p begin="00:56:17.910" end="00:56:22.110" style="s2">questions and I mean she again she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.280" end="00:56:25.230" style="s2">currently spending half the day dressed</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.110" end="00:56:28.830" style="s2">up like Batgirl or Catwoman right so if</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.230" end="00:56:31.950" style="s2">I told her that these superheroes were</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.830" end="00:56:34.740" style="s2">real she would believe that for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.950" end="00:56:36.870" style="s2">longest time and achieved if we lived in</p>

<p begin="00:56:41.010" end="00:56:47.610" style="s2">managed to maintain a conversation about</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.610" end="00:56:51.420" style="s2">they were real and that it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.930" end="00:56:53.310" style="s2">absolutely important to honor them and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.420" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">you&#39;d burn in hell if you failed to do</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:58.740" style="s2">this would be we would be meeting that</p>

<p begin="00:56:58.740" end="00:57:02.910" style="s2">of thing but it seems to me Sam that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.660" end="00:57:04.500" style="s2">bring up the superhero thing quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.910" end="00:57:08.460" style="s2">so I think I&#39;ll go about that directly</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.500" end="00:57:10.830" style="s2">so then I won okay so well so so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.460" end="00:57:14.820" style="s2">make the case in a moral landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.830" end="00:57:16.830" style="s2">they&#39;re an ideal is real because the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.820" end="00:57:18.840" style="s2">ideal that you define an ideal is real</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.830" end="00:57:20.370" style="s2">and the ideal is whatever maximizes</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.840" end="00:57:22.680" style="s2">well-being and gets us away from hell</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.370" end="00:57:24.780" style="s2">you said not only is that real you all</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.680" end="00:57:27.120" style="s2">say that&#39;s the fundamental axiom that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.780" end="00:57:28.770" style="s2">the claim in the moral landscape so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.120" end="00:57:31.860" style="s2">do make a claim that there is a real</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.770" end="00:57:33.150" style="s2">ideal and I would say it well I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.860" end="00:57:36.270" style="s2">necessarily put it that way but there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.670" end="00:59:36.299" style="s2">a kind and I&#39;m not sure I can find all</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.620" end="00:59:39.039" style="s2">sorts of flaws in</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.299" end="00:59:40.509" style="s2">but enough people are doing it that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.039" end="00:59:44.019" style="s2">something that needs to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.509" end="00:59:48.460" style="s2">well I it&#39;s I would say yes it speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.019" end="00:59:51.519" style="s2">a real failure of imagination and an</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.460" end="00:59:54.549" style="s2">effort in the secular community to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.519" end="01:00:00.249" style="s2">produce truly non embarrassing</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.549" end="01:00:02.049" style="s2">alternative exactly and this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.249" end="01:00:04.239" style="s2">across the board this is not just school</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.049" end="01:00:06.069" style="s2">this is how do you conduct a funeral how</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.239" end="01:00:08.589" style="s2">do you get married you know all of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.069" end="01:00:10.180" style="s2">it what rites of passage can you offer a</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.589" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">thirteen year what are you doing here</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.180" end="01:00:15.400" style="s2">what are we doing yeah yeah just to have</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.359" end="01:00:18.700" style="s2">how to have the first people in history</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.400" end="01:00:23.140" style="s2">to have absolutely no explanation for</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.700" end="01:00:27.789" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing at all yeah it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.140" end="01:00:30.460" style="s2">moment yeah yes and and that mean that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.789" end="01:00:33.819" style="s2">that sharpens up my concern perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.460" end="01:00:38.950" style="s2">because to to shrink back from that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.819" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">moment and resort to one of the pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.950" end="01:00:43.749" style="s2">stories of the past I consider to be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:50.049" style="s2">failure of nerve both both</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.749" end="01:00:52.509" style="s2">intellectually and morally okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.049" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">go back to the to the superhero idea one</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.509" end="01:00:55.329" style="s2">of the one of the things you might</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:57.579" style="s2">notice about superheroes is that some of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.329" end="01:00:59.470" style="s2">them are actually deities right so in</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.579" end="01:01:01.390" style="s2">the Marvel Pantheon you have Thor for</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.470" end="01:01:03.069" style="s2">example and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.390" end="01:01:05.049" style="s2">thin line between the idea of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.069" end="01:01:06.609" style="s2">superhero and the idea of a god</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.049" end="01:01:09.039" style="s2">especially if you think about it in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.609" end="01:01:10.869" style="s2">polytheistic manner so the modern</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.039" end="01:01:12.759" style="s2">superheroes and the Greek gods for</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.869" end="01:01:15.400" style="s2">example share a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.759" end="01:01:17.079" style="s2">features in common and so here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.400" end="01:01:19.259" style="s2">here&#39;s something to think about so</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.079" end="01:01:21.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that people admire</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.259" end="01:01:23.049" style="s2">superheroes and it&#39;s because they act</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.339" end="01:01:25.480" style="s2">out parts of the hero archetype that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.049" end="01:01:27.190" style="s2">the technical reason they&#39;re obviously</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.480" end="01:01:29.049" style="s2">acting something out because that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.190" end="01:01:32.079" style="s2">you can tell they&#39;re superheroes they</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.049" end="01:01:34.660" style="s2">share some set of characteristics across</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.079" end="01:01:36.970" style="s2">the set of superheroes that makes them</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.660" end="01:01:40.420" style="s2">super heroes now the question might be</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.970" end="01:01:42.519" style="s2">what is the essential element of being a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.420" end="01:01:44.589" style="s2">superhero that makes you a superhero and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.519" end="01:01:46.960" style="s2">the answer the way that that was solved</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.589" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">historically is that as polytheistic</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.960" end="01:01:50.740" style="s2">societies developed and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">usually a consequence of isolated tribes</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.740" end="01:01:53.829" style="s2">coming into contact with one another</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.140" style="s2">they each have their are separate</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.829" end="01:01:59.049" style="s2">deities and then over the course of time</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.140" end="01:02:01.960" style="s2">those deities ward in actual wars with</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.049" end="01:02:03.819" style="s2">people but also conceptually and out of</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.960" end="01:02:05.250" style="s2">that polytheistic framework was</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.819" end="01:02:07.599" style="s2">extracted something that was vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.250" end="01:02:09.190" style="s2">monotheistic as all of those cultures</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.599" end="01:02:11.799" style="s2">came together to try to determine what</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.190" end="01:02:13.990" style="s2">their highest ideal should be so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.799" end="01:02:15.579" style="s2">the God of gods that&#39;s a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.990" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">about it or the king of kings that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.579" end="01:02:19.539" style="s2">another way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:21.279" style="s2">that&#39;s an implicit ideal and I could</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.539" end="01:02:23.349" style="s2">make a case tells that to the Hindus</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.279" end="01:02:25.660" style="s2">there&#39;s you tell that to the Hindus</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.349" end="01:02:29.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve got 1.2 billion people or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.660" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">it&#39;s 1.4 now who are operating in a in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.319" end="01:02:34.089" style="s2">religiously saturated system that does</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:36.940" style="s2">not conform to that ideal there is no</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.089" end="01:02:38.950" style="s2">one on top they&#39;re still there still is</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.940" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">so arguably there&#39;s three on top of it</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.950" end="01:02:45.490" style="s2">all but there&#39;s still there&#39;s still an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:47.230" style="s2">attempt to generate that polytheistic to</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.490" end="01:02:48.940" style="s2">integrate that polytheistic reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.230" end="01:02:50.769" style="s2">underneath a single rubric or you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.940" end="01:02:53.259" style="s2">nothing but continual dissociation of</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.769" end="01:02:54.460" style="s2">the culture and I&#39;m not saying this is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.259" end="01:02:56.019" style="s2">pretty good description of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.460" end="01:02:57.730" style="s2">on in India at the moment well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.019" end="01:02:59.529" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that this is inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.730" end="01:03:01.210" style="s2">either and there is a tension the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.529" end="01:03:03.069" style="s2">problem the problem this is Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.210" end="01:03:05.349" style="s2">observation and remember Jay Elliot as</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.069" end="01:03:07.390" style="s2">well the problem with extracting out the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.349" end="01:03:09.069" style="s2">highest God from the panoply of gods is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.390" end="01:03:11.319" style="s2">the ideal becomes so abstract that it</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.069" end="01:03:13.029" style="s2">disappears that&#39;s the death of God and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.319" end="01:03:15.130" style="s2">Elliot has tracked that phenomena over</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.029" end="01:03:17.769" style="s2">multiple cultures not it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.130" end="01:03:19.390" style="s2">that&#39;s unique to the West so the danger</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.769" end="01:03:21.430" style="s2">of that abstraction is that it gets too</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.390" end="01:03:23.140" style="s2">abstract and disappears and leaves us in</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.430" end="01:03:26.769" style="s2">the situation the Douglas just pointed</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.140" end="01:03:29.289" style="s2">out can I first back to the key the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.769" end="01:03:30.490" style="s2">key issue of Elton John&#39;s glass which</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.289" end="01:03:31.980" style="s2">you came up with the other night because</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.490" end="01:03:35.140" style="s2">that&#39;s something I wanted to add to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.980" end="01:03:39.549" style="s2">explain why I said Elton John&#39;s glass</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.140" end="01:03:41.170" style="s2">just now oh well we came back to this</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.549" end="01:03:44.250" style="s2">question of what makes something</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.170" end="01:03:47.230" style="s2">valuable and I used as an example in</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.250" end="01:03:49.960" style="s2">Vancouver one of those nights if I had a</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.230" end="01:03:51.819" style="s2">glass here which I which I said was</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.960" end="01:03:54.130" style="s2">actually it was the glass that Elton</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.819" end="01:03:57.490" style="s2">John used the last time he played in</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.130" end="01:04:00.030" style="s2">this theater suddenly it seems to be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.490" end="01:04:02.340" style="s2">more valuable glass and</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.030" end="01:04:04.610" style="s2">then Jordan and I argued about putative</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.340" end="01:04:06.390" style="s2">what the status of that value was I</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.610" end="01:04:08.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know where you want to take this</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.390" end="01:04:10.560" style="s2">video well it&#39;s just one thing in</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.310" end="01:04:13.080" style="s2">particular which is that the whole issue</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.560" end="01:04:16.230" style="s2">of what it is you give value to and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.080" end="01:04:18.060" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s say that that glass was</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.230" end="01:04:20.850" style="s2">demonstrated for a time to having been</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.060" end="01:04:23.340" style="s2">drunk from by Elton John at his final</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.850" end="01:04:29.040" style="s2">concert of work latest farewell tour</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.340" end="01:04:30.450" style="s2">whatever so that&#39;s already a glass with</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.040" end="01:04:32.730" style="s2">something let&#39;s say that over the years</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.450" end="01:04:36.840" style="s2">the whole attribution of that glass</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.730" end="01:04:38.970" style="s2">becomes debatable over a long period of</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.840" end="01:04:41.070" style="s2">time a lot of things are going to have</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.970" end="01:04:42.510" style="s2">happened around it and to stretch this</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.070" end="01:04:45.000" style="s2">to breaking point</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.510" end="01:04:47.040" style="s2">possibly let&#39;s say at some point people</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.000" end="01:04:49.830" style="s2">lose their lives over whether that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.040" end="01:04:52.170" style="s2">Elton John&#39;s glass let&#39;s say that people</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.830" end="01:04:54.300" style="s2">are going to lose blood listen let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.170" end="01:04:56.160" style="s2">just say that let&#39;s recognize that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.300" end="01:04:58.350" style="s2">the world were living at with respective</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.160" end="01:04:59.940" style="s2">religions so the problem is that we end</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.350" end="01:05:01.500" style="s2">up when we&#39;re talking about religion</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.940" end="01:05:03.930" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.500" end="01:05:05.700" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about land you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.930" end="01:05:07.710" style="s2">not just talking about any inherent</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.700" end="01:05:10.440" style="s2">worth you&#39;re talking also about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.710" end="01:05:13.260" style="s2">worth of things people have given up for</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.440" end="01:05:14.760" style="s2">this yeah and so we end up giving the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.260" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">layers of things what knows it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.760" end="01:05:19.590" style="s2">than that we inherit more and more</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:22.380" style="s2">layers of the meaning because other</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.590" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">people before us have given that meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.380" end="01:05:27.180" style="s2">to it so that by the time you have this</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:29.810" style="s2">object it&#39;s an object of worth even if</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.180" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not of no worth in itself at all</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.810" end="01:05:35.160" style="s2">because of the amount of worth of people</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:37.560" style="s2">before you have given to it and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.160" end="01:05:42.150" style="s2">seems to some extent what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.560" end="01:05:46.080" style="s2">with the religion that&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.150" end="01:05:48.870" style="s2">productive I think so see when you start</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.080" end="01:05:50.700" style="s2">with the hypothesis of facts then you</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.870" end="01:05:52.590" style="s2">kind of have to define what effect is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.700" end="01:05:54.870" style="s2">and so I think the simplest way of doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.590" end="01:05:57.630" style="s2">that to begin with is that there&#39;s a set</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.870" end="01:05:59.580" style="s2">of objective facts and that&#39;s the facts</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.630" end="01:06:00.810" style="s2">about objective reality you can think</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.580" end="01:06:02.760" style="s2">about that from a scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.810" end="01:06:04.530" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to it we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.760" end="01:06:06.030" style="s2">agree that that exists although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.530" end="01:06:08.280" style="s2">very complicated and difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.030" end="01:06:10.470" style="s2">understand that exists as one set of</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.280" end="01:06:11.210" style="s2">constraints on what we can do and what</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.470" end="01:06:13.099" style="s2">we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.210" end="01:06:14.690" style="s2">that&#39;s the objective world and then on</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.099" end="01:06:17.300" style="s2">top of that and this is where things get</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.690" end="01:06:20.210" style="s2">very very complicated you have this</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.300" end="01:06:22.310" style="s2">layered system of meaning which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.210" end="01:06:24.140" style="s2">partly a manifestation of these layers</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.310" end="01:06:26.450" style="s2">of the nervous system that I described</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.140" end="01:06:28.339" style="s2">but also partly a manifestation of those</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.450" end="01:06:31.400" style="s2">layers of the nervous system operating</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.339" end="01:06:32.980" style="s2">in social space over vast periods of</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.400" end="01:06:35.030" style="s2">time so that would be the social</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.980" end="01:06:36.770" style="s2">sociological agreement that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.030" end="01:06:38.660" style="s2">layered on top of the objective world</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.770" end="01:06:40.460" style="s2">and it actually constitutes part of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.660" end="01:06:43.190" style="s2">the lens through which you view the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.460" end="01:06:46.190" style="s2">world to the degree where you actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.190" end="01:06:48.380" style="s2">see the layering in the thing so like</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.190" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">when you go to a museum and you look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.380" end="01:06:53.660" style="s2">Elvis Presley Elvis Presley&#39;s guitar you</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:56.570" style="s2">don&#39;t look at the guitar and think</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.660" end="01:06:57.619" style="s2">that&#39;s Elvis Presley&#39;s guitar that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.570" end="01:07:01.070" style="s2">how your brain works</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.619" end="01:07:03.140" style="s2">you actually see Elvis Presley&#39;s guitar</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.070" end="01:07:04.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an active perception so it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.140" end="01:07:07.130" style="s2">built right into your nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.400" end="01:07:09.170" style="s2">even though the fact that that is Elvis</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.130" end="01:07:11.060" style="s2">Presley&#39;s guitar and the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.170" end="01:07:13.099" style="s2">that&#39;s valuable is because of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.060" end="01:07:15.349" style="s2">sociological agreement about what</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.099" end="01:07:17.000" style="s2">position Elvis Presley occupied in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.349" end="01:07:19.460" style="s2">dominance hierarchy that we&#39;re all part</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.000" end="01:07:21.440" style="s2">of and so what you see when you look at</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.460" end="01:07:23.480" style="s2">an artifact like that is you see a layer</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.440" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">of dominance hierarchy overlaid on top</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.480" end="01:07:27.950" style="s2">of an objective reality and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">actually your phenomenal reality now the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.950" end="01:07:32.599" style="s2">thing that&#39;s so interesting is that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:34.280" style="s2">layer of perception that&#39;s mediating</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.599" end="01:07:36.589" style="s2">between the facts and you has a</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.280" end="01:07:38.839" style="s2">structure and that&#39;s the structure that</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.589" end="01:07:40.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve been insisting is a narrative and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.839" end="01:07:42.770" style="s2">think Sam thinks it&#39;s a narrative too</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.760" end="01:07:45.440" style="s2">because his fundamental ethic is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.770" end="01:07:47.990" style="s2">you should act in a way which means to</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:51.200" style="s2">embody a mode of being which means to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.990" end="01:07:53.960" style="s2">a personality that moves us from hell to</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.200" end="01:07:57.880" style="s2">something approximating heaven okay back</p>

<p begin="01:08:01.310" end="01:08:07.099" style="s2">that is a counterpoint to my concern</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.280" end="01:08:08.330" style="s2">about religion so fret because I agree</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.099" end="01:08:09.920" style="s2">with all that I mean there are some</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.330" end="01:08:11.630" style="s2">caveats I would issue for instance these</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.920" end="01:08:14.750" style="s2">posits my possible to walk into a museum</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.630" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">be shown a guitar not know it&#39;s Elvis</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.750" end="01:08:18.859" style="s2">Presley&#39;s guitar and then be told it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:21.500" style="s2">an Elvis presence Qatar and you can see</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.859" end="01:08:23.180" style="s2">in real time that change insignificant</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.500" end="01:08:25.009" style="s2">so that you can see the layers of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.180" end="01:08:27.380" style="s2">perceptual or the meaning accrue</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.009" end="01:08:29.509" style="s2">you might actually not even KITT you</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.380" end="01:08:31.190" style="s2">might know it who Elvis Presley is and</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.509" end="01:08:34.099" style="s2">not care Raisa there are many different</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.190" end="01:08:37.039" style="s2">things on on on the menu here as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.099" end="01:08:39.019" style="s2">to just holding the awestruck Elvis</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.039" end="01:08:40.519" style="s2">Presley&#39;s guitar Sam you know and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.019" end="01:08:42.500" style="s2">same is true of the Jesus story or</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.519" end="01:08:45.049" style="s2">anything else that people you can find</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.500" end="01:08:47.989" style="s2">layers of engagement with it that they</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.049" end="01:08:50.150" style="s2">may be more and less useful yes but my</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.989" end="01:08:54.469" style="s2">fundamental concern is that the the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.150" end="01:08:58.569" style="s2">you are tending to dignify the religious</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.469" end="01:09:02.389" style="s2">subset of stories as being foundational</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.569" end="01:09:06.920" style="s2">necessary just we criticize at our peril</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.389" end="01:09:09.409" style="s2">is giving people license to believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.920" end="01:09:10.969" style="s2">things that they clearly shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.409" end="01:09:14.630" style="s2">believe things that are intrinsically</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.969" end="01:09:16.519" style="s2">divisive intrinsically less-than-optimal</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.630" end="01:09:20.389" style="s2">as far as organizing an individual human</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.519" end="01:09:24.619" style="s2">life we can do better than Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.389" end="01:09:26.299" style="s2">on almost every question purple with the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.619" end="01:09:28.699" style="s2">possible exception of building churches</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.299" end="01:09:31.309" style="s2">okay so well the first thing is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.699" end="01:09:33.109" style="s2">first thing is that I deeply agree with</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.309" end="01:09:35.569" style="s2">you that that mechanism can go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.109" end="01:09:37.009" style="s2">okay so you have the objective world and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.569" end="01:09:38.989" style="s2">it&#39;s one set of constraints and then you</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.009" end="01:09:40.369" style="s2">have this interpretive structure and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.989" end="01:09:42.230" style="s2">not saying that that interpretive</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.369" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">structure is infallible it clearly isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.230" end="01:09:44.690" style="s2">and neither is the process that gives</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:46.940" style="s2">rise to it</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.690" end="01:09:48.949" style="s2">you see this for example in conditions</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.940" end="01:09:51.319" style="s2">like manic depressive disorder with</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.949" end="01:09:53.199" style="s2">religious delusions or schizophrenia you</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.319" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">see what what you see in those</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.199" end="01:09:57.829" style="s2">situations is a pathologize ation of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:10:00.289" style="s2">that overlay of meaning that can clearly</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.829" end="01:10:02.590" style="s2">have yeah okay now the question is what</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.289" end="01:10:04.820" style="s2">do we do about that how do we keep those</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.590" end="01:10:06.710" style="s2">perceptual structures which are somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.820" end="01:10:08.150" style="s2">arbitrary how do we keep them functional</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.710" end="01:10:09.619" style="s2">and this is I think where your</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.150" end="01:10:11.500" style="s2">discussion of rationality is so</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.619" end="01:10:13.489" style="s2">important particularly when you say</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.500" end="01:10:15.829" style="s2">rationality is what enables us to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.489" end="01:10:18.739" style="s2">establish what will you agree on in our</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.829" end="01:10:20.570" style="s2">shared reality okay so so imagine this</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.739" end="01:10:23.210" style="s2">so part of the way you weren&#39;t yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.570" end="01:10:25.909" style="s2">in the world of facts objective facts is</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.210" end="01:10:28.969" style="s2">through your senses so you basically</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.909" end="01:10:30.590" style="s2">have five dimensions of triangulation so</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.969" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">to speak to help you determine what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.590" end="01:10:34.880" style="s2">there in the objective world and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:37.360" style="s2">you have this multi-layer structure</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.880" end="01:10:38.870" style="s2">that&#39;s partly biological and partly</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.360" end="01:10:41.630" style="s2">socio-cultural that enable</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.870" end="01:10:43.970" style="s2">you to distill that but it can go astray</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.630" end="01:10:46.820" style="s2">partly because it ages and becomes</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.970" end="01:10:48.380" style="s2">archaic which is and demented for that</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.820" end="01:10:50.390" style="s2">matter which is partly your objection to</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.380" end="01:10:51.770" style="s2">the fundamentalist types this has been</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.390" end="01:10:53.900" style="s2">known for a very long time that this</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.770" end="01:10:55.790" style="s2">sort of thing happens so what we do with</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.900" end="01:10:58.580" style="s2">the way we solve that we have a solution</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.790" end="01:11:02.540" style="s2">to that so partly the way we solve that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.580" end="01:11:03.950" style="s2">is through articulated discourse right</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.540" end="01:11:05.270" style="s2">because you have a way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.950" end="01:11:07.070" style="s2">world and I have a way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.270" end="01:11:09.560" style="s2">world and we have to occupy the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.070" end="01:11:11.180" style="s2">space so you&#39;re probably wrong about</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.560" end="01:11:13.640" style="s2">some things and I&#39;m probably wrong about</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.180" end="01:11:15.680" style="s2">some things and hopefully if we talk we</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.640" end="01:11:18.050" style="s2">can sort out the differences and make</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.680" end="01:11:20.120" style="s2">things more stable right so but it and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.050" end="01:11:22.700" style="s2">would put rationality right in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.120" end="01:11:25.490" style="s2">place that&#39;s my rationale is prime but</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.700" end="01:11:28.280" style="s2">the problem fair enough but but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.490" end="01:11:30.710" style="s2">a problem with that too and and I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.280" end="01:11:34.910" style="s2">see the all the times we&#39;ve talked so</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.710" end="01:11:36.590" style="s2">far you&#39;ve been I would say the avatar</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.910" end="01:11:38.330" style="s2">of a scientific viewpoint and I&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.590" end="01:11:39.770" style="s2">cast let&#39;s say as the avatar of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.330" end="01:11:41.660" style="s2">religious viewpoint but I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.770" end="01:11:44.840" style="s2">thought this through scientifically a</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.660" end="01:11:46.400" style="s2">lot and I can make a biological argument</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.840" end="01:11:48.620" style="s2">for all of this and a developmental</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.400" end="01:11:50.360" style="s2">argument so it isn&#39;t only rationality</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.620" end="01:11:52.250" style="s2">that does this so this is what the thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.360" end="01:11:55.010" style="s2">that was so cool about studying for</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.250" end="01:11:56.450" style="s2">example Jean Piaget because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.010" end="01:11:59.900" style="s2">things Piaget pointed out is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.450" end="01:12:01.700" style="s2">children engage in negotiation if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.900" end="01:12:04.550" style="s2">negotiate their rent in reality just</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.700" end="01:12:06.290" style="s2">like adults do but they don&#39;t do it only</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.550" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">through articulated speech and neither</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.290" end="01:12:11.690" style="s2">do adults what children do is they get</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:13.400" style="s2">together and play and this is why play</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.690" end="01:12:14.600" style="s2">is so important for children that starts</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.400" end="01:12:16.760" style="s2">to happen when they&#39;re about three years</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.600" end="01:12:19.370" style="s2">of all old because they can look outside</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.760" end="01:12:21.380" style="s2">their own idiosyncratic perspective at</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.370" end="01:12:23.240" style="s2">3:00 and they can start to take someone</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.380" end="01:12:24.680" style="s2">else&#39;s viewpoint into consideration</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.240" end="01:12:26.600" style="s2">which is what you have to do if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.680" end="01:12:27.980" style="s2">going to play and then what children do</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.600" end="01:12:29.900" style="s2">is they invent little fictional</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.980" end="01:12:31.970" style="s2">realities that&#39;s what they do when</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.900" end="01:12:34.310" style="s2">they&#39;re pretending and so they assign</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.970" end="01:12:36.590" style="s2">each other roles and they assign a plot</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.310" end="01:12:38.150" style="s2">and a drama to the to the pretend play</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.590" end="01:12:40.520" style="s2">and then they act it out</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.150" end="01:12:43.340" style="s2">and in that action they bring themselves</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.520" end="01:12:44.990" style="s2">into harmonious union right which is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.340" end="01:12:48.350" style="s2">act of generating a game that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.990" end="01:12:49.550" style="s2">wants to play and Piaget his observation</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.350" end="01:12:51.260" style="s2">was and this is Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.550" end="01:12:52.200" style="s2">observation as well that the morality</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.260" end="01:12:55.050" style="s2">that character</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.200" end="01:12:57.590" style="s2">society isn&#39;t rationality top-down</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.050" end="01:13:00.750" style="s2">although it&#39;s partly that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.590" end="01:13:02.700" style="s2">interactions that are say play based and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.750" end="01:13:04.980" style="s2">bottom-up and that&#39;s actually how it</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.700" end="01:13:07.320" style="s2">evolved to begin with because animals</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.980" end="01:13:09.270" style="s2">generate societies that are functional</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.320" end="01:13:10.590" style="s2">but they don&#39;t do it through rationality</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.270" end="01:13:12.690" style="s2">they can&#39;t because they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.590" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">rationality they don&#39;t have articulated</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.690" end="01:13:18.150" style="s2">speech they have something like an</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:19.680" style="s2">embodied game now what happens and this</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.150" end="01:13:21.210" style="s2">is a Nietzsche and observation he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.680" end="01:13:23.550" style="s2">first person I learned this from is our</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.210" end="01:13:26.460" style="s2">morality emerged from the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.550" end="01:13:28.530" style="s2">through through thousands hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.460" end="01:13:31.140" style="s2">thousands of years of shared games let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.530" end="01:13:32.460" style="s2">say and and the interweaving of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.140" end="01:13:34.200" style="s2">shared games into something</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.460" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">approximating a morality that we could</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.200" end="01:13:39.600" style="s2">all live within peacefully that happened</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:41.340" style="s2">bought him up and then what happened was</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:43.290" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t know the mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.340" end="01:13:45.980" style="s2">behind that because it&#39;s instantiated in</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.290" end="01:13:49.080" style="s2">our nervous system invisibly we watched</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.980" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">ourselves act which is what we do and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.080" end="01:13:52.890" style="s2">then we told stories about that because</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:55.050" style="s2">that&#39;s what we do when we watch yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.890" end="01:13:57.930" style="s2">act and then we encapsulated the</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.050" end="01:14:00.300" style="s2">morality that evolved in the stories and</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.930" end="01:14:06.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the religious essence of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.300" end="01:14:08.910" style="s2">story ten seconds so we have to pivot to</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.780" end="01:14:10.230" style="s2">Douglas for a important question but I</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.910" end="01:14:13.940" style="s2">would just say in response to that</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.230" end="01:14:17.400" style="s2">Jordan I don&#39;t disagree with much of</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.940" end="01:14:19.590" style="s2">consequence in that my concern however</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.400" end="01:14:21.690" style="s2">is that there is there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.590" end="01:14:24.960" style="s2">reason why we differentiate childhood</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.690" end="01:14:28.950" style="s2">from adulthood and all of us are stunted</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.960" end="01:14:32.250" style="s2">to some degree or another in a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.950" end="01:14:35.130" style="s2">perverse childhood and the reason we</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.250" end="01:14:38.040" style="s2">what we confront now is a world largely</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.130" end="01:14:39.900" style="s2">populated by dangerous children right</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.040" end="01:14:43.290" style="s2">who are in their fifth and sixth decade</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.900" end="01:14:47.130" style="s2">of life I mean run by populated and run</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.290" end="01:14:49.440" style="s2">by yes and and it&#39;s so and really and if</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.130" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">anything typifies the childhood of our</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.440" end="01:14:55.140" style="s2">species in my view it is religious</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:57.540" style="s2">orthodoxy and insofar as we&#39;re breaking</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.140" end="01:14:59.670" style="s2">free of the orthodoxy part and getting</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.540" end="01:15:01.650" style="s2">something that&#39;s more scalable and with</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.670" end="01:15:04.620" style="s2">it and can survive a more pluralistic</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.650" end="01:15:05.800" style="s2">and cosmopolitan world it is because it</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.620" end="01:15:08.350" style="s2">is being win</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.800" end="01:15:10.660" style="s2">at every point by rationality and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.350" end="01:15:12.970" style="s2">think that that at some point we could</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.660" end="01:15:15.910" style="s2">have a fully defensible rational</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.970" end="01:15:18.250" style="s2">honoring of many of the things you think</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.910" end="01:15:20.950" style="s2">are essential like the power of story or</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.250" end="01:15:23.620" style="s2">the power of ritual or the power of art</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.950" end="01:15:27.670" style="s2">that is focused on some sacred purpose</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.620" end="01:15:29.650" style="s2">and the question is how to get there but</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.670" end="01:15:32.920" style="s2">we have a point of order here that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.650" end="01:15:36.580" style="s2">question but I want to hand over to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.920" end="01:15:38.680" style="s2">audience for Q&amp;A and for a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.580" end="01:15:41.890" style="s2">minutes I&#39;ve had a sign being waved at</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.680" end="01:15:45.310" style="s2">me saying Q&amp;A and really should obey</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.890" end="01:15:48.010" style="s2">design yes so I think what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.310" end="01:15:49.510" style="s2">happen is we&#39;re going to use your</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.010" end="01:15:51.700" style="s2">computer we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.510" end="01:15:54.130" style="s2">ask the audience first I think that was</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.700" end="01:15:56.470" style="s2">what we decided and you guys guess you</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.130" end="01:15:58.210" style="s2">guys get to vote by noise there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.470" end="01:16:01.180" style="s2">inflection point here we can do one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.210" end="01:16:02.740" style="s2">two things and all it when I&#39;ll let the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.180" end="01:16:05.110" style="s2">first people yell and then the second</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.740" end="01:16:08.110" style="s2">people yell but the question is we can</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.110" end="01:16:10.420" style="s2">either continue the discussion or we can</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.110" end="01:16:11.890" style="s2">stop and go to Q&amp;A so the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.420" end="01:16:15.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll do is say okay how many of you</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.890" end="01:16:18.060" style="s2">would like us to stop and go to Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.560" end="01:16:21.790" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.060" end="01:16:23.380" style="s2">okay second second question how many of</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.790" end="01:16:25.410" style="s2">you would like us to continue with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.380" end="01:16:25.410" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.930" end="01:16:36.730" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a successful vote okay I</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.910" end="01:16:38.140" style="s2">know the fish I want to go so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.730" end="01:16:39.220" style="s2">to seize the floor I want to ask a</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.140" end="01:16:41.110" style="s2">question of both of you</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.220" end="01:16:44.730" style="s2">okay it&#39;s about the three of us but I</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.110" end="01:16:44.730" style="s2">think it&#39;s more about the two of you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.900" end="01:16:52.750" style="s2">each of us to one or another degree has</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.240" end="01:16:57.280" style="s2">been described as a gateway drug to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.750" end="01:16:59.980" style="s2">all right we&#39;ve been attacked by by</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.280" end="01:17:02.550" style="s2">people left-of-center as somehow</p>

<p begin="01:17:23.320" end="01:17:30.700" style="s2">how do you how do you view this this</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.530" end="01:17:33.460" style="s2">reaction to you to your work and well</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.700" end="01:17:36.010" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to do that first yeah can I</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.460" end="01:17:37.510" style="s2">just say before I do I was going to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.010" end="01:17:39.160" style="s2">it if we were gonna go to audience Q&amp;A I</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.510" end="01:17:40.930" style="s2">understand though I was reminded today</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.160" end="01:17:45.610" style="s2">that there still a blasphemy law in</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.930" end="01:17:49.030" style="s2">Ireland am I right on that I I await the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.610" end="01:17:50.620" style="s2">police I&#39;m right aren&#39;t I yeah in which</p>

<p begin="01:17:50.620" end="01:17:57.810" style="s2">be happy if we leave the stage tonight</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.830" end="01:17:57.810" style="s2">and I have not both committed less right</p>

<p begin="01:18:01.349" end="01:18:05.789" style="s2">and if children would like to do quickly</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.999" end="01:18:12.489" style="s2">we could make it a full house I really</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.110" end="01:18:14.229" style="s2">do think we should be blasphemous I</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.489" end="01:18:17.249" style="s2">think I must have done that already but</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.229" end="01:18:19.780" style="s2">I I&#39;ll have to go to the tape on that um</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.249" end="01:18:22.869" style="s2">so well here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.780" end="01:18:23.949" style="s2">we&#39;ve all had similar issue experiences</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.869" end="01:18:26.650" style="s2">on them there are a number of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.949" end="01:18:29.769" style="s2">among our friends and colleagues perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.650" end="01:18:31.239" style="s2">you might say who&#39;ve had it as well and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.769" end="01:18:34.960" style="s2">I think what&#39;s happening at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.239" end="01:18:40.059" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a set of tripwires that</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.210" end="01:19:26.559" style="s2">set of these trip wires and I think</p>

<p begin="01:19:38.710" end="01:19:41.019" style="s2">great thing about this by the way is</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.849" end="01:19:43.119" style="s2">that once you survived the first</p>

<p begin="01:20:08.740" end="01:20:16.600" style="s2">concede at anyway that we&#39;re in there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.000" end="01:20:18.370" style="s2">only one thing we all agree on the one</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.600" end="01:20:20.940" style="s2">thing we all agree on is we mustn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:20:20.940" end="01:20:25.720" style="s2">broadly speaking that&#39;s the basis of our</p>

<p begin="01:20:59.680" end="01:21:02.740" style="s2">Taylor so if we agree that the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.390" end="01:21:06.850" style="s2">we&#39;re all meant to do is not become</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.740" end="01:21:09.850" style="s2">Nazis you build these incredibly deep</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.890" end="01:21:16.390" style="s2">lead us back to that the problem is is</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.800" end="01:21:20.380" style="s2">that people who have done that trench</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.390" end="01:21:23.290" style="s2">building include people who are doing it</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.380" end="01:21:24.940" style="s2">for their own personal political game so</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.290" end="01:21:27.520" style="s2">they build a set of trenches around</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.940" end="01:21:29.560" style="s2">their political views and they say if</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.520" end="01:21:32.470" style="s2">you come near this and you&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.560" end="01:21:34.150" style="s2">into that trench and they were Nazi some</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.470" end="01:21:35.410" style="s2">of it is for short-term convenience and</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.150" end="01:21:40.630" style="s2">I have no doubt that some of it is</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.410" end="01:21:42.790" style="s2">sincere but the amount of the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.630" end="01:21:45.670" style="s2">lying about it makes me doubt that last</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.790" end="01:21:49.210" style="s2">bit and let me add one other thing to</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.790" end="01:23:43.550" style="s2">culture ok so so the first thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.340" end="01:23:46.280" style="s2">people assume about me is that I&#39;m no</p>

<p begin="01:24:54.519" end="01:25:00.639" style="s2">collectivists enjoy acquiring a certain</p>

<p begin="01:25:07.630" end="01:25:12.099" style="s2">was concerned so I made a video saying</p>

<p begin="01:25:24.429" end="01:25:30.099" style="s2">do that partly because Canada works just</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.729" end="01:25:32.499" style="s2">fine and so nobody comes up and says</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.099" end="01:25:34.599" style="s2">waves the flag saying look we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.499" end="01:25:36.880" style="s2">wandering off a dangerous cliff here and</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.599" end="01:25:38.829" style="s2">so then if someone does stand up and say</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.880" end="01:25:41.110" style="s2">that then the first thing that all the</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.829" end="01:25:43.389" style="s2">other Canadians think and should think</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.110" end="01:25:47.229" style="s2">is that there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.389" end="01:25:49.690" style="s2">that person and that would be me so then</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.229" end="01:25:51.820" style="s2">the question would be well what variety</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.690" end="01:25:54.610" style="s2">of things could be wrong with dr.</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.820" end="01:25:56.440" style="s2">Peterson that&#39;s a very long list but the</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.610" end="01:25:59.100" style="s2">ones that might actually a better</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.440" end="01:26:02.650" style="s2">subtitles in it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.100" end="01:26:05.500" style="s2">terrific title yes so so what happened</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.650" end="01:26:07.390" style="s2">was I objected to the radical left that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.500" end="01:26:09.580" style="s2">was my perspective but the people who</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.390" end="01:26:12.160" style="s2">objected to me or who were even critical</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.580" end="01:26:13.990" style="s2">of me are curious about me thought okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.160" end="01:26:16.390" style="s2">well if Peterson isn&#39;t part of the left</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.990" end="01:26:17.800" style="s2">then where the hell is he and the answer</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.390" end="01:26:21.250" style="s2">could be well anywhere on the political</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.800" end="01:26:24.820" style="s2">spectrum including Nazi and of course</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.250" end="01:26:27.460" style="s2">that&#39;s hypothetically true and if I was</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.820" end="01:26:30.670" style="s2">a Nazi then that would be really useful</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.460" end="01:26:32.500" style="s2">for all the radical leftists because if</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.670" end="01:26:34.030" style="s2">you&#39;re a Nazi as Douglas has already</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.500" end="01:26:36.460" style="s2">pointed out we&#39;ve already decided that</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.030" end="01:26:38.350" style="s2">you&#39;re a bad person and if I was a bad</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.460" end="01:26:41.470" style="s2">person then no one would have to listen</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.350" end="01:26:44.680" style="s2">to me and so it was in the interests of</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.470" end="01:26:47.230" style="s2">the radicals who I was dispositions I</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.680" end="01:26:49.330" style="s2">was disputing to cast me as a Nazi but</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.230" end="01:26:50.950" style="s2">it was also a reasonable cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.330" end="01:26:53.140" style="s2">maneuver because there was some</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.950" end="01:26:55.120" style="s2">possibility although it&#39;s infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.140" end="01:26:57.310" style="s2">given the tiny proportion of actual</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.120" end="01:26:59.440" style="s2">Nazis in our society that I would in</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.310" end="01:27:02.020" style="s2">fact be one and have gotten away with</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.440" end="01:27:11.560" style="s2">hiding back at two major universities</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.020" end="01:27:15.430" style="s2">for 25 years and also also at that point</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.560" end="01:27:17.560" style="s2">I had 250 hours of my lectures on</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.430" end="01:27:19.330" style="s2">YouTube which was basically every word</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.560" end="01:27:22.510" style="s2">in essence that I ever uttered to a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.330" end="01:27:24.130" style="s2">student since 1993 and a huge part of</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.510" end="01:27:28.810" style="s2">that actually consisted of very</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.130" end="01:27:31.450" style="s2">trenchant criticisms of Nazis so it was</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.810" end="01:27:34.660" style="s2">difficult to pin that on me so so so but</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.450" end="01:27:37.270" style="s2">to give my critics credit they had their</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.660" end="01:27:40.830" style="s2">reason for vilifying me and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.270" end="01:27:44.050" style="s2">was if you object you might be a villain</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.830" end="01:27:47.200" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s steel man number</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.050" end="01:27:49.870" style="s2">one I&#39;m not at least the kind of villain</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.200" end="01:27:52.960" style="s2">they think I am although I might be some</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.870" end="01:27:56.080" style="s2">other kind of villain altogether so then</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.960" end="01:28:02.290" style="s2">the next steel man issue is the left has</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.080" end="01:28:04.150" style="s2">a place okay so why well here&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.290" end="01:28:06.910" style="s2">order to act properly in the world you</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.150" end="01:28:08.410" style="s2">have to do things everyone agrees on</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.910" end="01:28:09.880" style="s2">that and to do things you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.410" end="01:28:11.530" style="s2">them in the social world you have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.880" end="01:28:12.130" style="s2">cooperate and compete with other people</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.530" end="01:28:13.719" style="s2">and when</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.130" end="01:28:15.820" style="s2">you cooperate and compete with other</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.719" end="01:28:18.310" style="s2">people in the service of valid goals</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.820" end="01:28:20.230" style="s2">valuable goals productive goals you</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.310" end="01:28:21.670" style="s2">produce hierarchies you produce</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.230" end="01:28:23.320" style="s2">hierarchies of competence and</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.670" end="01:28:25.090" style="s2">hierarchies of power those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.320" end="01:28:26.920" style="s2">exactly the same thing but at that</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.090" end="01:28:29.920" style="s2">either way you produce hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.920" end="01:28:31.870" style="s2">hierarchies dispossessed people they</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.920" end="01:28:34.510" style="s2">dispossessed people because the spoils</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.870" end="01:28:36.040" style="s2">go to a few that&#39;s the problem of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.510" end="01:28:38.380" style="s2">unequal distribution of wealth and</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.040" end="01:28:40.420" style="s2">because in any hierarchy of competence a</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.380" end="01:28:42.580" style="s2">disproportionate number of a small</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.420" end="01:28:46.060" style="s2">number of people do most of the creative</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.580" end="01:28:47.949" style="s2">work and these are ironclad laws okay so</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.060" end="01:28:50.290" style="s2">the problem with hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.949" end="01:28:51.370" style="s2">necessary but the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.290" end="01:28:54.880" style="s2">hierarchies is they produce</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.370" end="01:28:58.420" style="s2">dispossession and the left in principle</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.880" end="01:29:01.360" style="s2">speaks for the dispossessed and someone</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.420" end="01:29:03.340" style="s2">has to speak for the dispossessed and so</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.360" end="01:29:05.170" style="s2">when the lefties look at me and they say</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.340" end="01:29:07.270" style="s2">well dr. Peterson is always speaking</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.170" end="01:29:09.070" style="s2">about the necessity of hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.270" end="01:29:11.290" style="s2">how can we be sure that he&#39;s not trying</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.070" end="01:29:13.659" style="s2">to justify them in their current</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.290" end="01:29:15.639" style="s2">position and obscure the fact that they</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.659" end="01:29:17.830" style="s2">tend towards tyranny and deception which</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.639" end="01:29:20.409" style="s2">they clearly do how do we know that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.830" end="01:29:22.600" style="s2">just not reifying the present power</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.409" end="01:29:24.310" style="s2">structure for his own aims and why</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.600" end="01:29:27.010" style="s2">should we trust him and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.310" end="01:29:28.480" style="s2">perfectly valid objection now I believe</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.010" end="01:29:30.909" style="s2">it happens to be wrong because I</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.480" end="01:29:32.920" style="s2">understand the downside of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.909" end="01:29:35.380" style="s2">and and I also think I understand how to</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.920" end="01:29:37.690" style="s2">go about rectifying that but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.380" end="01:29:39.550" style="s2">they&#39;re objecting insofar as they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.690" end="01:29:40.900" style="s2">as insofar as they&#39;re playing a straight</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.550" end="01:29:43.270" style="s2">political game and not just the</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.900" end="01:29:45.370" style="s2">ideological form of grandeur grandiose</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.270" end="01:29:46.600" style="s2">behavior so there&#39;s one other thing in</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.370" end="01:29:50.500" style="s2">this which is worth mentioning which is</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.600" end="01:29:52.750" style="s2">the perception is that as it were aside</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.500" end="01:29:54.429" style="s2">from let&#39;s say this is the center of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.750" end="01:29:56.800" style="s2">political access and I&#39;m going to have</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.429" end="01:29:59.860" style="s2">to do this for you but okay that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.800" end="01:30:03.130" style="s2">right the presumption is it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.860" end="01:30:04.780" style="s2">cliff like if you start by saying I</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.130" end="01:30:08.949" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think people should pay</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.780" end="01:30:12.900" style="s2">smaller taxes you&#39;re there and you just</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.949" end="01:30:12.900" style="s2">go like that and then it&#39;s not sysm</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.020" end="01:30:22.090" style="s2">and here&#39;s the really weird thing that</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.150" end="01:30:24.369" style="s2">is disco because all of this look good</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.090" end="01:30:25.869" style="s2">all of this is just the footnote still</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.369" end="01:30:27.429" style="s2">to the 20th century and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.869" end="01:30:29.980" style="s2">trying to work out what happened and why</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.429" end="01:30:32.559" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know and in the history</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.980" end="01:30:35.320" style="s2">books the period we&#39;re living in will be</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.559" end="01:30:38.380" style="s2">the post Holocaust post-world War two</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.320" end="01:30:40.210" style="s2">post gulag world when they were still</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.380" end="01:30:44.320" style="s2">trying to sort out what happened behind</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.210" end="01:30:46.480" style="s2">the crime scene tape okay so on the left</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.320" end="01:30:49.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a very interesting thing which</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.480" end="01:30:52.420" style="s2">is that you can go pretty much all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.150" end="01:30:54.039" style="s2">way like this and first of all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.420" end="01:30:56.829" style="s2">not a very wide recognition that you</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.039" end="01:30:57.909" style="s2">have the gulag not there&#39;s not very much</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.829" end="01:30:59.920" style="s2">known about that people don&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.909" end="01:31:01.420" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn they don&#39;t mean it so so</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.920" end="01:31:06.039" style="s2">you think they pretty much power left</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.420" end="01:31:07.869" style="s2">you just hit the vegans but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.039" end="01:31:10.199" style="s2">actually little action you might be you</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.869" end="01:31:12.699" style="s2">might be like radical in your fairness</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.199" end="01:31:14.619" style="s2">okay so the problem here is not just</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.699" end="01:31:17.020" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what happened on that</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.619" end="01:31:19.300" style="s2">side but it&#39;s worse than that there was</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.020" end="01:31:21.820" style="s2">a there was a young girl a commentator</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.300" end="01:31:23.679" style="s2">on the TV in London a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.820" end="01:31:25.989" style="s2">morning&#39;s ago arguing about Trump and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.679" end="01:31:28.059" style="s2">on as usual not very enlightening</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.989" end="01:31:29.860" style="s2">discussion she&#39;s arguing with Piers</p>

<p begin="01:32:16.270" end="01:32:21.250" style="s2">were working for the Canadian government</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.949" end="01:32:23.530" style="s2">trying to find me Oh Nazi Canadian</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.250" end="01:32:26.290" style="s2">government constituted 50% of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.530" end="01:32:27.969" style="s2">neo-nazis in the Canada so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.290" end="01:32:29.590" style="s2">stirring around looking for the Nazis</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.969" end="01:32:31.119" style="s2">like this and on the other side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.590" end="01:32:32.710" style="s2">like mainstream all the television yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.119" end="01:32:35.590" style="s2">I&#39;m a communist I&#39;d love to go through</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.710" end="01:32:37.030" style="s2">that again well okay so so here here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.590" end="01:32:39.159" style="s2">another problem this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.030" end="01:32:41.679" style="s2">interesting problem okay so you brought</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.159" end="01:32:43.690" style="s2">out two things and one is no one knows</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.679" end="01:32:45.310" style="s2">about what happened in Maoist China or</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.690" end="01:32:46.869" style="s2">what happened in the Soviet Union which</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.310" end="01:32:48.909" style="s2">is absolutely appalling because we</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.869" end="01:32:52.750" style="s2">should all know that and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.909" end="01:32:55.090" style="s2">obviously a cliff on the left side now I</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.750" end="01:32:57.040" style="s2">would say actually there is the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.090" end="01:32:58.750" style="s2">possibility that as you move farther out</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.040" end="01:33:01.030" style="s2">on each end of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.750" end="01:33:02.830" style="s2">the rate at which you deteriorate</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.030" end="01:33:05.070" style="s2">accelerates so it&#39;s not linear I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.830" end="01:33:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s possible but having said that</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.070" end="01:33:10.389" style="s2">that&#39;s also the case on the left now one</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.320" end="01:33:12.369" style="s2">of the things we could say is well those</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.389" end="01:33:14.770" style="s2">idiot leftists should get their house in</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.369" end="01:33:17.050" style="s2">order because they won&#39;t differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.770" end="01:33:21.219" style="s2">themselves from their radical brethren</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.050" end="01:33:23.320" style="s2">okay so now we might ask well why we</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.219" end="01:33:25.360" style="s2">might ask two things why and whose</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.320" end="01:33:28.330" style="s2">problem is that exactly okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.360" end="01:33:29.920" style="s2">first issue of why is well people who</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.330" end="01:33:32.530" style="s2">are left-leaning have a hard time</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.920" end="01:33:34.719" style="s2">drawing boundaries that&#39;s what makes</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.530" end="01:33:37.090" style="s2">them left-leaning and I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.719" end="01:33:38.889" style="s2">technically because left-leaning people</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.090" end="01:33:40.900" style="s2">are high in openness to experience which</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.889" end="01:33:42.820" style="s2">is a creativity trait so they like</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.900" end="01:33:44.739" style="s2">information flow and they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.820" end="01:33:46.780" style="s2">borders between things and they tend to</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.739" end="01:33:49.239" style="s2">be low and orderliness so disorder</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.780" end="01:33:50.889" style="s2">doesn&#39;t disgust and upset them okay so</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.239" end="01:33:52.540" style="s2">they can&#39;t draw boundaries and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.889" end="01:33:53.949" style="s2">why they&#39;re on the left but boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.540" end="01:33:55.540" style="s2">have their problems so there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.949" end="01:33:58.900" style="s2">utility and people who don&#39;t like them</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.540" end="01:34:02.110" style="s2">okay but the second problem is and this</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.900" end="01:34:04.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t a problem that&#39;s only germane to</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.110" end="01:34:07.940" style="s2">the left it&#39;s the problem of the dam</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.070" end="01:34:11.230" style="s2">twentieth century it&#39;s like okay when</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.940" end="01:34:14.780" style="s2">does the left go to far an answer is</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.230" end="01:34:17.659" style="s2">nobody knows like with the right-wingers</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.780" end="01:34:20.179" style="s2">you can tell man it&#39;s like they make a</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.659" end="01:34:24.320" style="s2">claim of ethnic or racial superiority</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.179" end="01:34:26.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like barks Nazi right and then you</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.320" end="01:34:27.739" style="s2">can see that this happens because even</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.060" end="01:34:29.869" style="s2">back in the 70s when William F Buckley</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.739" end="01:34:32.420" style="s2">was sort of a leading conservative he</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.869" end="01:34:35.389" style="s2">put a box around the Ku Klux Klan in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.420" end="01:34:37.520" style="s2">John Birch types and he said I&#39;m not you</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.389" end="01:34:39.050" style="s2">but none of that&#39;s happening on the left</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.520" end="01:34:43.219" style="s2">okay why</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.050" end="01:34:46.159" style="s2">well they say well we stand for</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.219" end="01:34:47.270" style="s2">diversity it&#39;s like well everyone likes</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.159" end="01:34:49.790" style="s2">diversity and well what about</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.270" end="01:34:51.710" style="s2">inclusivity damn right man let&#39;s include</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.790" end="01:34:54.020" style="s2">some people but what about what about</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.710" end="01:34:56.750" style="s2">equality that&#39;d be good that&#39;d be good</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.020" end="01:34:59.270" style="s2">let&#39;s have some equality it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.750" end="01:35:01.610" style="s2">well how much equality exactly well then</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.270" end="01:35:02.420" style="s2">it&#39;s gradations right well equality of</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.610" end="01:35:06.800" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.420" end="01:35:12.020" style="s2">damn straight equality of outcome sounds</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.800" end="01:35:15.969" style="s2">good how about no under no circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.020" end="01:35:15.969" style="s2">whatsoever but you know what I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.000" end="01:35:20.659" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.219" end="01:35:23.630" style="s2">but here&#39;s the problem man you get</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.659" end="01:35:26.599" style="s2">somebody you get somebody saying race or</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.630" end="01:35:28.699" style="s2">ethnicity group member X is detestable</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.599" end="01:35:31.010" style="s2">because of their group identity and you</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.699" end="01:35:32.900" style="s2">think evil Nazi but then you see someone</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.010" end="01:35:34.789" style="s2">saying well I just wish that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.900" end="01:35:36.650" style="s2">could have an equal outcome what are you</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.789" end="01:35:38.659" style="s2">gonna do you gonna punch them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.650" end="01:35:40.010" style="s2">what you&#39;re supposed to do with Nazis no</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.659" end="01:35:42.349" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re gonna think oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.010" end="01:35:44.119" style="s2">a pretty nice person it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.349" end="01:35:46.610" style="s2">because you&#39;re nice doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.119" end="01:35:50.269" style="s2">good and just because you stand for</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.610" end="01:35:54.050" style="s2">equality of outcome doesn&#39;t mean right</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.269" end="01:35:56.900" style="s2">but it&#39;s but the thing is it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.050" end="01:35:59.420" style="s2">technical problem right because it looks</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.900" end="01:36:01.820" style="s2">like you need a multi variant equation</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.420" end="01:36:03.530" style="s2">to define pathology on the left it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.820" end="01:36:07.550" style="s2">like well if you believe this and this</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.530" end="01:36:09.619" style="s2">and this and to disproportionately then</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.550" end="01:36:11.239" style="s2">we have to put a box around you but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.619" end="01:36:13.550" style="s2">not like someone wears a symbol on their</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.239" end="01:36:16.880" style="s2">damn shirt or cat hood onto their face</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.550" end="01:36:18.949" style="s2">that enables you to identify them so we</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.880" end="01:36:21.800" style="s2">have a real structural problem here we</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.949" end="01:36:24.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to box in pathology on</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.800" end="01:36:26.479" style="s2">the left yeah no one knows including the</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.289" end="01:36:28.719" style="s2">moderate leftist but none of us know an</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.479" end="01:36:32.840" style="s2">additional problem is that many of these</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.719" end="01:36:35.179" style="s2">issues may not have a solution that we</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.840" end="01:36:36.920" style="s2">can happily live with right so if it</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.179" end="01:36:39.199" style="s2">takes it let&#39;s sharpen this up and this</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.920" end="01:36:41.749" style="s2">is more in the interest of steel man in</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.199" end="01:36:45.050" style="s2">our critics you take a problem like</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.749" end="01:36:47.150" style="s2">immigration right now the the the</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.050" end="01:36:49.880" style="s2">intuition that&#39;s driving the left I</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.150" end="01:36:52.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t take the extreme case of an open</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.880" end="01:36:56.269" style="s2">borders ethic you know but borders are</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.070" end="01:37:01.059" style="s2">illegitimate borders are it&#39;s just in</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.269" end="01:37:04.459" style="s2">principle a sign of selfishness and</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.059" end="01:37:07.369" style="s2">xenophobia and and unearned privilege</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.459" end="01:37:09.229" style="s2">right you one of us can take credit for</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.369" end="01:37:11.749" style="s2">the fact that we were born into the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.229" end="01:37:13.219" style="s2">societies we were born into and yet we</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.749" end="01:37:16.159" style="s2">have all of the advantages of having</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.219" end="01:37:18.229" style="s2">been born there and so it is with with</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.159" end="01:37:20.570" style="s2">all of you I mean we none of us are</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.229" end="01:37:23.809" style="s2">currently living through this civil war</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.570" end="01:37:27.949" style="s2">in Syria now and that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.809" end="01:37:30.939" style="s2">for all of us and so the the the concern</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.949" end="01:37:32.150" style="s2">here is that the moment you say well</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.939" end="01:37:34.370" style="s2">immigration</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.150" end="01:37:36.110" style="s2">potentially a problem right emigrate we</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.370" end="01:37:40.100" style="s2">can&#39;t just all throw open the borders to</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.110" end="01:37:42.350" style="s2">all of humanity because what would</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.100" end="01:37:45.199" style="s2">happen what would happen is people would</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.350" end="01:37:49.699" style="s2">continue to cross those borders until</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.199" end="01:37:53.150" style="s2">the the level of well-being in in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.699" end="01:37:54.949" style="s2">developed world diminished so much that</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.150" end="01:37:56.780" style="s2">there was no reason to cross the borders</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.949" end="01:38:00.650" style="s2">anymore right maybe they were just like</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.780" end="01:38:02.810" style="s2">some principle of osmosis right so okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.650" end="01:38:03.489" style="s2">so so so it&#39;s even it&#39;s even worse than</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.810" end="01:38:06.909" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.489" end="01:38:10.460" style="s2">but the concern is that this is totally</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.909" end="01:38:13.310" style="s2">ethically speaking this is a totally</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.460" end="01:38:15.860" style="s2">illegitimate situation and to shine a</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.310" end="01:38:18.949" style="s2">bright enough light on any particular</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.860" end="01:38:22.280" style="s2">story in Syria say I mean you just you</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.949" end="01:38:25.159" style="s2">give me the right family with children</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.280" end="01:38:27.350" style="s2">and I learn enough about them and their</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.159" end="01:38:31.130" style="s2">plight and I recognize within you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.350" end="01:38:33.050" style="s2">30 seconds that if I were them I would</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.130" end="01:38:35.780" style="s2">be desperate to get to Dublin or New</p>

<p begin="01:38:40.210" end="01:38:50.929" style="s2">completely it seems evil to in any way</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.640" end="01:38:53.630" style="s2">perpetuate this lottery where you hold a</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.929" end="01:38:55.429" style="s2">bad ticket and sorry that&#39;s this is this</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.630" end="01:38:58.400" style="s2">defines the rest of your life and the</p>

<p begin="01:39:15.830" end="01:39:21.890" style="s2">and it can survive every test of</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.880" end="01:39:23.810" style="s2">narrative I&#39;ve made this goes straight</p>

<p begin="01:39:37.340" end="01:39:41.840" style="s2">changed and so this is up again this is</p>

<p begin="01:39:49.400" end="01:39:54.110" style="s2">because it&#39;s been your issue or more</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.570" end="01:39:56.810" style="s2">than ours yet how callous must you be to</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.110" end="01:39:58.639" style="s2">be worrying about immigration and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.810" end="01:40:00.290" style="s2">that that&#39;s obviously there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:40:00.290" end="01:40:05.449" style="s2">but there is a there&#39;s an ethical core</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.110" end="01:40:07.190" style="s2">to it that is it&#39;s difficult to dismiss</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.449" end="01:40:08.719" style="s2">and this is something which I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.190" end="01:40:10.040" style="s2">not just that issues almost every issue</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.719" end="01:40:13.179" style="s2">we were talking about a bit of about</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.040" end="01:40:16.389" style="s2">this at dinner that we seem not to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.179" end="01:40:18.800" style="s2">well we just aren&#39;t ready for the</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.389" end="01:40:21.020" style="s2">communications age we&#39;re in mhm and</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.800" end="01:40:23.960" style="s2">we&#39;re just not ready for it our brains</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.020" end="01:40:26.810" style="s2">are not yet able to cope let me give an</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.960" end="01:40:29.409" style="s2">example the notion of private and public</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.810" end="01:40:33.530" style="s2">speech that&#39;s just basically evaporated</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.409" end="01:40:37.850" style="s2">so that if you this is the problem try</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.530" end="01:40:39.699" style="s2">out an idea with your friends just throw</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.850" end="01:40:42.110" style="s2">around an idea we&#39;ve all done it</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.699" end="01:40:44.449" style="s2">we&#39;re around ideas with your friends if</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.110" end="01:40:46.489" style="s2">even one person is videoing it and might</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.449" end="01:40:49.639" style="s2">post did this is whatever it is well</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.489" end="01:40:51.800" style="s2">we&#39;re all in it&#39;s too dangerous to try</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.639" end="01:40:54.830" style="s2">things out for most people that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.800" end="01:40:58.340" style="s2">problem of no borders and so this is it</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.830" end="01:41:00.080" style="s2">so we are always vulnerable that are for</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.340" end="01:41:00.710" style="s2">instance most people in Europe for</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.080" end="01:41:02.510" style="s2">instance want</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.710" end="01:41:04.040" style="s2">borders I mean they&#39;re like overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.510" end="01:41:07.190" style="s2">majority in every country want there to</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.040" end="01:41:09.050" style="s2">be borders but if you show them a</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.190" end="01:41:10.880" style="s2">footage of somebody being turned away at</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.050" end="01:41:13.639" style="s2">the border that morning there&#39;s but we</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.880" end="01:41:15.530" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do with it we have</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.639" end="01:41:17.389" style="s2">abstract principles we need to abide by</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.530" end="01:41:18.980" style="s2">we want to abide by everybody wants to</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.389" end="01:41:21.860" style="s2">abide by it but we don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.980" end="01:41:23.560" style="s2">in this precisely this era and I think</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.860" end="01:41:26.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve just got our mother things work</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.560" end="01:41:28.520" style="s2">and all sorts of ways to find ways to</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.600" end="01:41:30.380" style="s2">think about this sort of deeper than the</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.520" end="01:41:33.340" style="s2">ones we&#39;ve managed so far one of them</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.380" end="01:41:37.420" style="s2">yes is to cope with the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.340" end="01:41:40.820" style="s2">unbelievable luck but we&#39;ve all got</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.420" end="01:41:45.739" style="s2">unbelievable luck and then the questions</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.820" end="01:41:48.530" style="s2">from that if I&#39;m lucky what am i what</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.739" end="01:41:50.360" style="s2">are my priorities what am i obligation</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.530" end="01:41:52.340" style="s2">what am i open again cuz I&#39;m lucky what</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.360" end="01:41:55.580" style="s2">are my obligations and some people say</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.340" end="01:41:56.840" style="s2">my obligation is to share my home with</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.580" end="01:41:57.980" style="s2">the rest of the world if that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.840" end="01:42:00.320" style="s2">it&#39;s worse than that</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.980" end="01:42:01.880" style="s2">it&#39;s because I know lots of people</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.320" end="01:42:03.440" style="s2">who&#39;ve taken in a refugee and things</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.880" end="01:42:04.970" style="s2">like that okay and I have unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.440" end="01:42:07.040" style="s2">admiration for them that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.970" end="01:42:08.420" style="s2">breaking the walk but if the different</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.040" end="01:42:09.680" style="s2">people who called your bluff when you</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.420" end="01:42:11.570" style="s2">said I don&#39;t see you taking in refugees</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.680" end="01:42:12.860" style="s2">into your home and they said oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.570" end="01:42:15.200" style="s2">one in the living room right now I</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.860" end="01:42:17.030" style="s2">always want to turn up to their houses</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.200" end="01:42:20.510" style="s2">with some refugees they I&#39;ve got yours</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.030" end="01:42:22.400" style="s2">right there sir there also aren&#39;t 50 in</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.510" end="01:42:24.739" style="s2">the living room exactly right and that</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.400" end="01:42:27.560" style="s2">okay so so so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.739" end="01:42:31.610" style="s2">elaborate on this this a bit more okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.560" end="01:42:33.590" style="s2">so the issue is borders exclude right</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.610" end="01:42:34.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s a postmodern proposition or</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.590" end="01:42:37.310" style="s2">maybe you could take that even further</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.760" end="01:42:40.700" style="s2">that borders exclude and privilege those</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.310" end="01:42:42.410" style="s2">within the borders it&#39;s like yes okay so</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.700" end="01:42:44.600" style="s2">let&#39;s take that seriously now part of</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.410" end="01:42:47.239" style="s2">the seriousness is poor innocent</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.600" end="01:42:49.910" style="s2">children are hurt at borders that</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.239" end="01:42:52.580" style="s2">happens all the time okay the question</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.910" end="01:42:54.920" style="s2">is are you willing to give up the</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.580" end="01:43:00.560" style="s2">borders now let&#39;s think about what</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.920" end="01:43:02.870" style="s2">borders are your skin is a border okay</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.560" end="01:43:05.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re prejudiced in protection of</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.870" end="01:43:08.090" style="s2">your skin for example you won&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.000" end="01:43:10.760" style="s2">sleep with anyone you reserve the right</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.090" end="01:43:12.890" style="s2">to keep that border intact right and to</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.760" end="01:43:15.739" style="s2">be choosy about the manner in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.890" end="01:43:18.290" style="s2">broached you&#39;re you likely have a</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.739" end="01:43:21.260" style="s2">bedroom it probably has walls you have</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.290" end="01:43:24.710" style="s2">clothing you have a house you have a</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.260" end="01:43:26.810" style="s2">town you have a state you have a country</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.710" end="01:43:28.640" style="s2">and those are all borders its borders</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.810" end="01:43:30.620" style="s2">within borders within borders within</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.640" end="01:43:33.680" style="s2">borders and you need those borders</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.620" end="01:43:35.480" style="s2">because otherwise you will die so we</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.680" end="01:43:37.820" style="s2">could not be too hypocritical about the</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.480" end="01:43:40.250" style="s2">damn borders is like we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.820" end="01:43:42.140" style="s2">to organize fragile things without</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.250" end="01:43:43.970" style="s2">putting boundaries around them and you</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.140" end="01:43:45.860" style="s2">see that in Genesis right as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.970" end="01:43:48.100" style="s2">people realize that I&#39;m sneaking in a</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.860" end="01:43:50.960" style="s2">little religion here in case of</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.100" end="01:43:52.700" style="s2">as soon as people realize they become</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.960" end="01:43:54.440" style="s2">self-conscious they wake up and realize</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.700" end="01:43:57.680" style="s2">their vulnerability the first thing they</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.440" end="01:43:59.510" style="s2">do is manufacture a border between them</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.680" end="01:44:01.280" style="s2">in the world and we need borders between</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.510" end="01:44:03.200" style="s2">us in the world and we pay a bloody</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.280" end="01:44:05.510" style="s2">price for borders and I and I say those</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.200" end="01:44:07.790" style="s2">words very carefully we play pay a</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.510" end="01:44:09.500" style="s2">bloody price for borders and it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.790" end="01:44:11.540" style="s2">in the price of other people&#39;s blood and</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.500" end="01:44:13.940" style="s2">so then the question might be well how</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.540" end="01:44:15.860" style="s2">should you conduct yourself ethically in</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.940" end="01:44:18.050" style="s2">a world where other people are paying in</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.860" end="01:44:19.340" style="s2">blood for your borders and the answer</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.050" end="01:44:21.980" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been trying to communicate to</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.340" end="01:44:24.560" style="s2">people is get your damn house in order</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.980" end="01:44:26.720" style="s2">mayor as much responsibility as you can</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.560" end="01:44:28.580" style="s2">act as effectively as you can as an</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.720" end="01:44:31.640" style="s2">individual in the world because then you</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.580" end="01:44:33.620" style="s2">can justify your privilege you can</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.640" end="01:44:36.050" style="s2">justify your luck and your good fortune</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.620" end="01:44:38.420" style="s2">and maybe within the confines of your</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.050" end="01:44:40.910" style="s2">border you can be more productive and</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.420" end="01:44:43.490" style="s2">useful than you would be in the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.910" end="01:44:45.230" style="s2">absence of borders altogether and it</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.490" end="01:44:47.270" style="s2">seems to me that that&#39;s the case and</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.230" end="01:44:49.760" style="s2">then we have to have a discussion okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.270" end="01:44:51.290" style="s2">the left doesn&#39;t like borders and the</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.760" end="01:44:53.900" style="s2">right is more fond of them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.290" end="01:44:55.700" style="s2">both right and so because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.900" end="01:44:57.410" style="s2">how strict the border should be or how</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.700" end="01:44:59.360" style="s2">permeable it should be it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.410" end="01:45:02.150" style="s2">absolute so nothing moves between</p>

<p begin="01:47:36.680" end="01:47:41.620" style="s2">say there&#39;s a complex situation that</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.360" end="01:47:45.440" style="s2">requires a tremendous amount of adult</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.620" end="01:47:47.360" style="s2">cognitive computation to solve like what</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.440" end="01:47:49.760" style="s2">do we do about the borders because</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.360" end="01:47:52.790" style="s2">tearing them down is not the answer well</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.760" end="01:47:54.980" style="s2">the person who stands up and says well I</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.790" end="01:47:56.360" style="s2">see someone who&#39;s hurt by a border and I</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.980" end="01:47:59.060" style="s2">feel empathy for them</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.360" end="01:48:02.240" style="s2">then immediately says therefore I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.060" end="01:48:05.810" style="s2">which isn&#39;t so bad but therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.240" end="01:48:08.060" style="s2">also morally superior to you and this is</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.810" end="01:48:09.950" style="s2">this is one of the true pathologies of</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.060" end="01:48:12.170" style="s2">the empathic collectivists is that they</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.950" end="01:48:15.179" style="s2">presume that their reflexive empathy</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.170" end="01:48:17.550" style="s2">marks them out as morally superior and</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.179" end="01:48:19.469" style="s2">that&#39;s appalling because part of it is a</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.550" end="01:48:21.090" style="s2">it&#39;s too easy just because I feel sorry</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.469" end="01:48:23.310" style="s2">for you doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m good partly</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.090" end="01:48:25.770" style="s2">because I can feel so sorry for you that</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.310" end="01:48:26.730" style="s2">I&#39;m actually harmful to you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.770" end="01:48:28.830" style="s2">what happens in the case of</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.730" end="01:48:34.110" style="s2">overprotective parents for example so we</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.830" end="01:48:36.810" style="s2">know perfectly well that that empathy is</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.110" end="01:48:38.880" style="s2">not an untrammeled moral virtue it has</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.810" end="01:48:41.099" style="s2">to be tempered by other virtues and</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.880" end="01:48:44.280" style="s2">carefully tempered by other virtues and</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.099" end="01:48:46.380" style="s2">so we have to stop allowing in our</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.280" end="01:48:48.929" style="s2">public discourse the unquestioned</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.380" end="01:48:51.630" style="s2">assumption that just because I manifest</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.929" end="01:48:53.489" style="s2">more pity in the moment than you do that</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.630" end="01:48:55.349" style="s2">I&#39;m somehow a morally superior</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.489" end="01:48:57.869" style="s2">individual in fact not only do we have</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.349" end="01:49:00.840" style="s2">to question that we in fact have to we</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.869" end="01:49:02.909" style="s2">have to deeply question it and say what</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.840" end="01:49:05.040" style="s2">makes you think that you&#39;re that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.909" end="01:49:07.199" style="s2">just not taking things too far right</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.040" end="01:49:09.060" style="s2">there because there&#39;s just as much error</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.199" end="01:49:10.860" style="s2">on the side of too much empathy as there</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.060" end="01:49:12.599" style="s2">is on the side of too little empathy and</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.860" end="01:49:14.369" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard thing for everyone to</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.599" end="01:49:18.000" style="s2">learn because empathy feels so good like</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.369" end="01:49:20.310" style="s2">if you feel mercy towards a suffering</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.000" end="01:49:22.139" style="s2">child it&#39;s like that is kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.310" end="01:49:25.469" style="s2">indication that you&#39;re an ethical person</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.139" end="01:49:28.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the basis for complex and</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.469" end="01:49:36.650" style="s2">sophisticated foreign policy we know it</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.440" end="01:49:40.380" style="s2">isn&#39;t because if we we know our empathy</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.650" end="01:49:42.750" style="s2">diminishes yeah oh you know most linear</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.380" end="01:49:45.150" style="s2">way with the numbers of people to</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.750" end="01:49:47.429" style="s2">empathize with right so we spoke about</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.150" end="01:49:49.050" style="s2">this one one night in Vancouver but this</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.429" end="01:49:51.420" style="s2">has been tested where if you tell</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.050" end="01:49:54.420" style="s2">someone that the about the plight of one</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.420" end="01:49:56.070" style="s2">little girl you will elicit the maximum</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.420" end="01:49:58.530" style="s2">empathic response and the met the</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.070" end="01:49:59.670" style="s2">maximum of an altruistic response though</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.530" end="01:50:01.770" style="s2">they&#39;ll give the most amount of money</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.670" end="01:50:03.989" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna give to any cause to one</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.770" end="01:50:06.480" style="s2">compelling story to save one little boy</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.989" end="01:50:08.610" style="s2">or girl but if you start adding boys and</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.480" end="01:50:11.250" style="s2">girls to the to the one keeping the one</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.610" end="01:50:12.840" style="s2">the same people&#39;s empathy degrades and</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.250" end="01:50:15.750" style="s2">they&#39;re actual at their altruism - grace</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.840" end="01:50:18.030" style="s2">okay so empathy is non quantitative</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.750" end="01:50:22.080" style="s2">almost by definition it&#39;s also partly</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.030" end="01:50:24.949" style="s2">because in your life if you see a person</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.080" end="01:50:24.949" style="s2">in trouble yes</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.120" end="01:50:29.500" style="s2">you see a million people in trouble what</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.580" end="01:50:32.770" style="s2">you should probably do at least to begin</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.500" end="01:50:35.980" style="s2">with is run yeah what are you gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.770" end="01:50:37.930" style="s2">it maybe you could give $1,000 to one</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.980" end="01:50:39.640" style="s2">person but no but if you divided that up</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.930" end="01:50:41.290" style="s2">among a million all that would happen</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.640" end="01:50:42.700" style="s2">would you would you would be happy you</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.290" end="01:50:45.370" style="s2">would have no money and they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.700" end="01:50:50.460" style="s2">any better off buts but but this is to</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.370" end="01:50:54.160" style="s2">say that so much of moral progress today</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.460" end="01:50:57.540" style="s2">entails unhooking from the highly</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.160" end="01:50:59.650" style="s2">salient empathy driving story and</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.540" end="01:51:02.740" style="s2">connecting with the the actual</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.650" end="01:51:05.200" style="s2">quantitative reality to learn that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.740" end="01:51:07.690" style="s2">five hundred thousand people dying every</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.200" end="01:51:10.420" style="s2">year from heart disease or whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.690" end="01:51:12.730" style="s2">is or there&#39;s there&#39;s this five hundred</p>

<p begin="01:51:12.730" end="01:51:18.940" style="s2">the fact that that can&#39;t be made sexy</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.420" end="01:51:20.890" style="s2">for our news cycle right the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.940" end="01:51:22.570" style="s2">we lose attention is something we have</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.890" end="01:51:24.400" style="s2">to figure out how to correct also it can</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.570" end="01:51:27.300" style="s2">it&#39;s very interestingly akin to your</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.400" end="01:51:29.710" style="s2">objection that you raised before is that</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.300" end="01:51:31.630" style="s2">there are there are adult forms of</p>

<p begin="01:51:31.630" end="01:51:35.020" style="s2">children&#39;s play which is something by</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.520" end="01:51:36.910" style="s2">the way I agree with because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.020" end="01:51:39.100" style="s2">think that the manner in which children</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.910" end="01:51:40.900" style="s2">organize the world is the end of the way</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.100" end="01:51:42.910" style="s2">that things should be organized it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.900" end="01:51:44.950" style="s2">basis for some of the organization but</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.910" end="01:51:48.790" style="s2">this is akin to the same issue is that</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.950" end="01:51:50.560" style="s2">the the basal motivational response is</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.790" end="01:51:53.770" style="s2">the emotional responses no matter how</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.560" end="01:51:55.690" style="s2">well-meaning aren&#39;t of sufficient</p>

<p begin="01:51:58.000" end="01:52:01.720" style="s2">and then we have another problem too is</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.860" end="01:52:03.610" style="s2">that well that&#39;s really troublesome for</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.720" end="01:52:05.590" style="s2">people because they want to do the right</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.610" end="01:52:07.990" style="s2">thing globally and then you tell them</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.590" end="01:52:09.790" style="s2">look you don&#39;t know anything you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.990" end="01:52:11.920" style="s2">know how to take this insanely</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.790" end="01:52:14.470" style="s2">complicated system that we have and</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.920" end="01:52:16.570" style="s2">improve it and just because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.470" end="01:52:19.150" style="s2">feeling pity doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re an</p>

<p begin="01:52:19.150" end="01:52:22.990" style="s2">systems for example and this one there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.580" end="01:52:27.190" style="s2">one straightforward way to do that I</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.990" end="01:52:29.140" style="s2">mean give an example there&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.190" end="01:52:32.080" style="s2">Kurdish demographer who&#39;s a Swedish</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.140" end="01:52:34.200" style="s2">citizen now who cited this fact that it</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.080" end="01:52:36.940" style="s2">costs the same amount to bring one</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.200" end="01:52:38.070" style="s2">refugee and keep them in Sweden as it</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.940" end="01:52:41.730" style="s2">does to look up</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.070" end="01:52:44.099" style="s2">100 refugees in Jordan Turkey or Lebanon</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.730" end="01:52:46.650" style="s2">okay so the obvious thing from that is</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.099" end="01:52:49.079" style="s2">you say look it&#39;s math less then to be</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.650" end="01:52:50.280" style="s2">for instance bringing in thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.079" end="01:52:52.440" style="s2">refugees to Sweden you could be looking</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.280" end="01:52:54.869" style="s2">after hundreds of thousands of people in</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.440" end="01:52:56.550" style="s2">the region why is that still a painted</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.869" end="01:52:58.050" style="s2">argument it&#39;s because people aren&#39;t sure</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.550" end="01:53:00.630" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to smuggle in racism</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.050" end="01:53:04.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think are you sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.630" end="01:53:04.340" style="s2">not just coming up with this democracy</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.800" end="01:53:11.610" style="s2">gonna start with NGO figures and before</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.570" end="01:53:13.380" style="s2">we know it it&#39;s Auschwitz that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.610" end="01:53:16.469" style="s2">they think right right but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.380" end="01:53:18.270" style="s2">thing there&#39;s a shortcut solution to</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.469" end="01:53:20.489" style="s2">answering almost every single one of</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.270" end="01:53:23.909" style="s2">these problems is assume that your</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.489" end="01:53:27.030" style="s2">interlocutor has good motives assume</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.909" end="01:53:29.670" style="s2">that they are being honest in the way</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.030" end="01:53:31.469" style="s2">that they&#39;re looking at it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.670" end="01:53:32.969" style="s2">why I say comment about that okay so</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.469" end="01:53:35.280" style="s2">this is something I deal with in my</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.969" end="01:53:39.630" style="s2">clinical practice all the time okay so</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.280" end="01:53:41.429" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re naive and then what</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.630" end="01:53:43.400" style="s2">what you are when you&#39;re naive is</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.429" end="01:53:45.599" style="s2">someone who thinks you trust people</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.400" end="01:53:47.219" style="s2">because you think everybody has good</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.599" end="01:53:49.980" style="s2">motivations which is some sense what</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.219" end="01:53:51.599" style="s2">Douglass&#39;s is recommending and they say</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.980" end="01:53:53.790" style="s2">well that&#39;s just naive it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.599" end="01:53:56.310" style="s2">wait a second though because here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.790" end="01:53:57.449" style="s2">developmental pathway first you&#39;re naive</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.310" end="01:53:59.190" style="s2">and you trust everyone</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.449" end="01:54:01.650" style="s2">and then someone cuts you off at the</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.190" end="01:54:03.210" style="s2">knees or multiple people do or maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.650" end="01:54:04.770" style="s2">cut yourself off at the knees because</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.210" end="01:54:07.020" style="s2">you trusted yourself too much and you</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.770" end="01:54:08.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t take into account the malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.020" end="01:54:10.170" style="s2">that lurks in your heart and the hearts</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.730" end="01:54:12.840" style="s2">of others and so that you get</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.170" end="01:54:15.510" style="s2">traumatized by betrayal and then you</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.840" end="01:54:17.670" style="s2">become cynical and you think Jesus I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.510" end="01:54:19.920" style="s2">lot smarter now that I&#39;m cynical and you</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.670" end="01:54:22.980" style="s2">are because cynical is actually a move</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.920" end="01:54:26.280" style="s2">up on naive but it&#39;s not the last move</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.980" end="01:54:28.619" style="s2">the last move is to transcend cynicism</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.280" end="01:54:30.780" style="s2">and to say that even though I know that</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.619" end="01:54:32.969" style="s2">there are just as many snakes as in your</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.780" end="01:54:34.770" style="s2">heart as there are in my heart I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.969" end="01:54:36.869" style="s2">to hold out my hand in trust because</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.770" end="01:54:39.309" style="s2">that&#39;s the best way to elevate both of</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.869" end="01:54:46.059" style="s2">us and that is the prerequisite first</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.309" end="01:54:47.559" style="s2">discussion and to concede that this one</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.059" end="01:54:49.269" style="s2">I&#39;m always going on about Aristotle on</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.559" end="01:54:51.309" style="s2">this to concede that it&#39;s not between</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.269" end="01:54:53.649" style="s2">good and evil but between competing</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.309" end="01:54:55.179" style="s2">virtues but when it comes to something</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.649" end="01:54:57.760" style="s2">like the Border&#39;s discussion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.179" end="01:54:59.530" style="s2">dealing with justice and mercy you</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.760" end="01:55:02.349" style="s2">cannot only be driven by one of those</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.530" end="01:55:05.709" style="s2">virtues you mercy itself will lead you</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.349" end="01:55:09.159" style="s2">to hell yep justice on its own blind yes</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.709" end="01:55:11.469" style="s2">unseeing can lead you to hell yes well</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.159" end="01:55:16.239" style="s2">and so this also and we&#39;re running very</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.469" end="01:55:18.909" style="s2">short on time here so this is also why</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.239" end="01:55:20.889" style="s2">your emphasis on truth and thy emphasis</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.909" end="01:55:23.769" style="s2">on truth is so absolutely important</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.889" end="01:55:26.019" style="s2">because you and I obviously differ on a</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.769" end="01:55:28.389" style="s2">variety of different things and and as</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.019" end="01:55:31.209" style="s2">Douglas does with both of us but you</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.389" end="01:55:33.159" style="s2">know that doesn&#39;t mean that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.209" end="01:55:35.559" style="s2">that I think that you&#39;re a bad person I</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.159" end="01:55:37.599" style="s2">don&#39;t think that actually what I what I</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.559" end="01:55:39.699" style="s2">think and what I fervently hope is that</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.599" end="01:55:42.369" style="s2">some of the things that you think are</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.699" end="01:55:44.679" style="s2">wrong actually turn out to be right in a</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.369" end="01:55:46.539" style="s2">way that would be extremely helpful to</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.679" end="01:55:48.729" style="s2">me and everyone I know if I incorporated</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.539" end="01:55:50.499" style="s2">them like I really hope that because I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.729" end="01:55:52.119" style="s2">rather not be stupid and wrong if I</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.499" end="01:55:54.669" style="s2">could help it because then I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.119" end="01:55:57.189" style="s2">to wander into a pit and so I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.669" end="01:55:58.869" style="s2">that if if we can have a genuine</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.189" end="01:56:00.729" style="s2">dialogue and we can tell each other the</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.869" end="01:56:02.679" style="s2">truth which is the crucial issue here</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.729" end="01:56:04.329" style="s2">then I can find out what you know that I</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.679" end="01:56:06.489" style="s2">don&#39;t know and that&#39;ll make me stronger</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.329" end="01:56:09.369" style="s2">and it&#39;ll fortify everyone around me and</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.489" end="01:56:11.499" style="s2">that&#39;s the basis for the right and</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.369" end="01:56:13.419" style="s2">responsibility of free speech right you</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.499" end="01:56:15.969" style="s2">have the right of free speech but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.419" end="01:56:18.939" style="s2">so that you can be a responsible bearer</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.969" end="01:56:21.579" style="s2">of free speech so that you can say the</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.939" end="01:56:23.439" style="s2">truth so that you can set the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.579" end="01:56:24.909" style="s2">right and adjust the hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.439" end="01:56:26.739" style="s2">make sure the borders are properly</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.909" end="01:56:28.569" style="s2">functional and so that we can keep this</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.739" end="01:56:31.479" style="s2">thing going properly and that is all</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.569" end="01:56:33.309" style="s2">dependent at least in part well in large</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.479" end="01:56:34.510" style="s2">part on the truth but also to some</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.309" end="01:56:36.609" style="s2">degree on this faculty that you</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.510" end="01:56:37.749" style="s2">described as rational because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.609" end="01:56:39.369" style="s2">engaged in a rot</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.749" end="01:56:41.439" style="s2">I know rationality isn&#39;t enough that</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.369" end="01:56:44.050" style="s2">that&#39;s my sense you know but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.439" end="01:56:45.909" style="s2">certainly an adult form of communication</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.050" end="01:56:48.249" style="s2">and it&#39;s definitely their prerequisite</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.909" end="01:56:50.859" style="s2">to a discussion like this which seems to</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.249" end="01:56:52.599" style="s2">me really highly useful and which I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.859" end="01:56:55.659" style="s2">happy that you&#39;re all Willie</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.599" end="01:57:03.909" style="s2">to participate in how strangely how</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.659" end="01:57:05.499" style="s2">strange that is notwithstanding yes well</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.909" end="01:57:07.479" style="s2">we&#39;ve been shown various cards that</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.499" end="01:57:09.459" style="s2">would have diminishing increments of</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.479" end="01:57:11.379" style="s2">time and now they have just stopped</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.459" end="01:57:15.219" style="s2">showing his cards because we&#39;re totally</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.379" end="01:57:18.550" style="s2">incorrigible but yeah I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.219" end="01:57:21.099" style="s2">reiterate what Jordan just said there</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.550" end="01:57:23.800" style="s2">you you all really are the occasion for</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.099" end="01:57:26.079" style="s2">this conversation though you are are in</p>
