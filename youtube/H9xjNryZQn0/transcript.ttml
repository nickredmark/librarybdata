<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">to leave it as</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:19.150" style="s2">structures and structures as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:22.570" style="s2">and when I firstly contacted you about</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.570" end="00:02:29.170" style="s2">listeners a bit of background talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.510" end="00:02:32.830" style="s2">about the I practice martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.170" end="00:02:35.470" style="s2">Brazilian jiu-jitsu and connecting to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.830" end="00:02:39.209" style="s2">to the conversations you had with other</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.470" end="00:02:42.820" style="s2">people&#39;s well we were speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.209" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">your think about your experience with</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.820" end="00:02:48.760" style="s2">martial arts so about the reason and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">meaning meaning meaning in life my</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.760" end="00:02:55.750" style="s2">question would be a weapon dislike leave</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">it very open-ended for a martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.750" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">that is very focused on combat</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">competition that it comes from from from</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:11.739" style="s2">a complete season of martial arts a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:15.910" style="s2">complete system I mean just not martial</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.739" end="00:03:20.890" style="s2">bats as a way of living and that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.910" end="00:03:23.890" style="s2">losing it maybe because it&#39;s specialized</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.890" end="00:03:27.459" style="s2">in combat sports and self-defense there</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.890" end="00:03:30.910" style="s2">are elements that it may not it may be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.459" end="00:03:34.209" style="s2">losing like being a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.910" end="00:03:38.380" style="s2">transformation meditation and quest for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.209" end="00:03:41.230" style="s2">wisdom my question would be how without</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.380" end="00:03:43.989" style="s2">having to to just take something and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.230" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">copy from other style what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.989" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">principles of the elements necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:55.870" style="s2">a martial art to be a complete system to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:58.570" style="s2">issue being a system of attack and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.870" end="00:04:02.440" style="s2">defense and competition but also a to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.570" end="00:04:06.810" style="s2">for meditation a to for quest for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.440" end="00:04:11.530" style="s2">meaning in life gaining of increase and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:15.730" style="s2">transformation mmm that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.530" end="00:04:20.140" style="s2">question so I guess there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.730" end="00:04:21.760" style="s2">things first well I would I would I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.140" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">generally talk about trying to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.760" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">an ecology of practices and I you might</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:27.870" style="s2">have seen some of the discussions I had</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:30.510" style="s2">with reef Kelly or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.870" end="00:04:34.110" style="s2">the martial arts are integrated with</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.510" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">parkour practices and movement practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.110" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">and discourse practices so those are</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">still ways of answering those questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:49.950" style="s2">one is extensively sorry all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">my throat went wrong extensively would</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.950" end="00:04:56.550" style="s2">be well one of the things you might want</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:05:00.660" style="s2">to consider is situating your combat</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.550" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">practice within some like mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.660" end="00:05:07.200" style="s2">practices some discourse practices some</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:09.690" style="s2">other movement practices like parkour</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.200" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">like rape does or some of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.690" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">I&#39;m doing with my Nana but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">trying to situate a martial art within a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:22.229" style="s2">broader column of trying to teach people</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:23.820" style="s2">various aspects of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.229" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">understanding and personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.820" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">transformation so one thing would be can</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:30.600" style="s2">you situate it and then if you if you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:33.810" style="s2">that then you&#39;ve got a you got to think</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.600" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">about some very important questions one</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:37.169" style="s2">is you want to you want to look for you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">want to look for compensatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.169" end="00:05:42.030" style="s2">relationships between the practices</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:43.890" style="s2">right though what are their respective</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.030" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">strengths and weaknesses and how can I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.890" end="00:05:50.640" style="s2">properly align them and you need you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:53.760" style="s2">need you need mediating practices so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.640" end="00:05:56.760" style="s2">like an example I take from Rafe is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.760" end="00:05:58.440" style="s2">you have martial art practices right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.760" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">then you have movement practices and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">then you have moving mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:04.200" style="s2">practices and then you have sitted</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">mindfulness practices and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.200" end="00:06:07.200" style="s2">these sort of short shared mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:09.450" style="s2">practices and you see how they all</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.200" end="00:06:11.280" style="s2">overlap and they mediate between each</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.450" end="00:06:12.990" style="s2">other they&#39;re structured so that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.280" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">an ecology that mediates they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.990" end="00:06:17.660" style="s2">speak to each other they can constrain</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">inform make each other more insightful</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.660" end="00:06:23.729" style="s2">so I would think my first note the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:25.710" style="s2">answer is the extensive answer try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.729" end="00:06:28.020" style="s2">cultivate an oncology of practice and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.710" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">like I say look for competent</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.020" end="00:06:31.650" style="s2">compensatory relations of strength and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:34.110" style="s2">weakness and that look for mediation</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.650" end="00:06:35.729" style="s2">relations so that they overlap inform</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.110" end="00:06:36.180" style="s2">mutually constrain and talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.729" end="00:06:38.700" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.180" end="00:06:40.380" style="s2">then there&#39;s the intensive answer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.700" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">intensive answer</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.380" end="00:06:48.540" style="s2">is try to explicate the implicit</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:51.750" style="s2">knowledge you&#39;re developing so one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.540" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">the ways in which I one of the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.750" end="00:06:55.890" style="s2">which this became apparent to me and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:00.060" style="s2">I&#39;m going to recommend something a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.890" end="00:07:01.590" style="s2">minute is to go from doing a martial art</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.060" end="00:07:04.860" style="s2">to trying to teach somebody else not to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.590" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">do it because then what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.860" end="00:07:09.420" style="s2">is you have to go from an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:12.390" style="s2">implicit understanding of that that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.420" end="00:07:14.730" style="s2">participatory knowing I fear of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.390" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">body what we&#39;re like right the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.730" end="00:07:18.150" style="s2">you&#39;re knowing you&#39;re knowing of it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:20.820" style="s2">through it and the way that&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.150" end="00:07:22.650" style="s2">to your perspectival knowing how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.820" end="00:07:24.810" style="s2">sizing up the situation salience</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.650" end="00:07:27.000" style="s2">landscaping things right you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">from just running that intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.000" end="00:07:31.890" style="s2">implicitly and you have to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:35.730" style="s2">try and sit try and learn how would you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.890" end="00:07:38.220" style="s2">try to describe that state that knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.730" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">to somebody help us what would what how</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.220" end="00:07:43.290" style="s2">would you try to describe how to go from</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.260" end="00:07:46.110" style="s2">not being in that state to being in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.290" end="00:07:48.320" style="s2">state so the intensive strategy which</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.110" end="00:07:51.420" style="s2">often helps through trying to teach</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.320" end="00:07:53.550" style="s2">someone else what that state is like and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.420" end="00:07:55.200" style="s2">how to enter into that state you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.550" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">take you want to have an exit you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.200" end="00:07:59.370" style="s2">to have an intensive strategy of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">explication where you&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.370" end="00:08:03.780" style="s2">explicit you&#39;re bringing conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:05.370" style="s2">awareness to it you&#39;re trying to trace</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.780" end="00:08:07.200" style="s2">out the processing you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.370" end="00:08:10.260" style="s2">break up your overall Gestalt of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.200" end="00:08:12.540" style="s2">movement into you know you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.260" end="00:08:13.970" style="s2">relevant components and and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.540" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">integrated together because that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.970" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">explication of your otherwise implicit</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.570" end="00:08:22.470" style="s2">intuitive knowledge and if you can put</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">it into conceptual form what people then</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.470" end="00:08:26.130" style="s2">then can do this is sort of construe a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:28.650" style="s2">level when you get that sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.130" end="00:08:30.540" style="s2">abstract conceptual representation you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.650" end="00:08:33.900" style="s2">can then transfer it to other aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.540" end="00:08:35.430" style="s2">your life you can say okay I know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.900" end="00:08:37.320" style="s2">this feels like I know what this is like</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.430" end="00:08:39.660" style="s2">and I now know how to get into it not</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.320" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">just intuitively implicitly but I have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.660" end="00:08:44.099" style="s2">how might I think this is what I do and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">then think about how think about again</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.099" end="00:08:48.450" style="s2">the mediation idea so I&#39;m teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:50.730" style="s2">martial arts right so I&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.450" end="00:08:54.180" style="s2">explication but then I ask myself how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.730" end="00:08:56.220" style="s2">I bring that flow right and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.180" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">situational awareness and that elation</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.220" end="00:09:01.350" style="s2">into my teaching my academic teaching</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:03.780" style="s2">how do I transfer it because you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.350" end="00:09:05.520" style="s2">and then so if you think about it these</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.780" end="00:09:07.140" style="s2">two strategies the extensive and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:09.840" style="s2">intensive then talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.140" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">because right because notice I get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.840" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">intensive strategy of explication and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:17.100" style="s2">then if when I get a sort of an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:18.900" style="s2">grip on that I can start to transfer it</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.100" end="00:09:21.810" style="s2">to other areas of my life and when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.900" end="00:09:23.610" style="s2">start doing the transfer right that will</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.810" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">then start to talk also to you Kent</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.610" end="00:09:27.750" style="s2">setting up in ecology practices and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">you can get that whole thing organized</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.750" end="00:09:31.980" style="s2">towards transforming your sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">your sense of world your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.980" end="00:09:38.400" style="s2">meaning of this opposed to just you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">you know your sense of combat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.400" end="00:09:47.700" style="s2">very interesting in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">background resources mmm what would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.700" end="00:09:53.580" style="s2">the the first like the first line of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:10:00.860" style="s2">resources that they can go to in terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.580" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">of learn or get inspiration how follow</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.860" end="00:10:08.040" style="s2">so I mean I like tweeted about this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">I recommend Kellis put out an online</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.040" end="00:10:12.360" style="s2">course he&#39;s got videos where he&#39;s tried</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:14.370" style="s2">to show and he&#39;s done recently where he</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.360" end="00:10:16.500" style="s2">tries to explain how you put together</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.370" end="00:10:20.150" style="s2">these ecologies or practices in the ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.500" end="00:10:24.660" style="s2">that you and I have been talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.150" end="00:10:26.490" style="s2">think you you want to you you you also</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.660" end="00:10:28.590" style="s2">want to track down individual resources</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.490" end="00:10:30.930" style="s2">that are you know geographically a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.590" end="00:10:33.570" style="s2">convenient to you for you know attending</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.930" end="00:10:36.300" style="s2">a good mindfulness group taking up some</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.570" end="00:10:39.630" style="s2">kind of movement practice the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.300" end="00:10:43.500" style="s2">thing is to but you might want to take a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">look at some of the online biological</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.500" end="00:10:47.700" style="s2">practices I&#39;ve been engaging in with</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:50.700" style="s2">guys and stalk especially the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.700" end="00:10:54.960" style="s2">invented circling and I did one recently</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.700" end="00:10:58.050" style="s2">with Edwin Roush and so you could get an</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.960" end="00:10:58.950" style="s2">idea of what that looks like and and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.050" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">could start to read some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.950" end="00:11:05.610" style="s2">literature on circling so I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:07.560" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be too specific because</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.610" end="00:11:09.420" style="s2">the the particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.560" end="00:11:12.180" style="s2">ecology practices and the particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.420" end="00:11:13.590" style="s2">places but that&#39;s that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">recommend you are going to vary</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.590" end="00:11:18.210" style="s2">depending on where you are but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:20.270" style="s2">recommend you know I think race work is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.210" end="00:11:23.070" style="s2">a good sort of initial starting point</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.270" end="00:11:26.760" style="s2">mark Walsh has a book out I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.070" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">oh oh oh I want to remember it I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.760" end="00:11:31.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not beyond mindfulness and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:33.270" style="s2">about embodiment mark Walsh&#39;s book is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.410" end="00:11:35.700" style="s2">excellent I thought I read it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.270" end="00:11:37.770" style="s2">commented on it so there is a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.700" end="00:11:39.750" style="s2">valuable resource I hope I get I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.770" end="00:11:42.510" style="s2">hoping getting the name of the book</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.750" end="00:11:47.339" style="s2">write a mark of a guy wrong I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.510" end="00:11:49.260" style="s2">but his book is is fantastic so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.339" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">some initial places places to start</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.260" end="00:11:56.460" style="s2">that&#39;s great what is circling about so</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:57.900" style="s2">circle I got involved with circling</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.460" end="00:12:00.690" style="s2">because of the work I&#39;m doing with Peter</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.900" end="00:12:03.089" style="s2">Lim burkas and whether the work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.690" end="00:12:06.540" style="s2">doing is towards the next series I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.089" end="00:12:08.220" style="s2">working on the after Socrates series the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.540" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">pursuit and cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.220" end="00:12:13.110" style="s2">through authentic dialogue and circling</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:15.180" style="s2">as one of these modern practices was</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.110" end="00:12:16.710" style="s2">invented by guys Sam stock who&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.180" end="00:12:18.350" style="s2">friend of mine did brilliant God</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.710" end="00:12:21.930" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.350" end="00:12:24.150" style="s2">and what circling is is a way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.930" end="00:12:27.540" style="s2">to change what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.150" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">discourse into something that has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.540" end="00:12:32.460" style="s2">of important features that you see in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:38.850" style="s2">sort of Socratic dialogue it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.460" end="00:12:41.310" style="s2">about trying to use conversation not</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.850" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">just as a way of transmitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.310" end="00:12:47.339" style="s2">information but a way for two people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:50.130" style="s2">really get as guy says it really get</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.339" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">each other&#39;s world really so that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.130" end="00:12:53.640" style="s2">not just getting information from you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:56.370" style="s2">and much more it&#39;s much more important</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.640" end="00:12:58.530" style="s2">to me in the conversation to create a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.370" end="00:13:00.630" style="s2">dynamic sense of mutual opening I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.530" end="00:13:03.209" style="s2">getting how you&#39;re seeing me and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.630" end="00:13:06.330" style="s2">getting right how I&#39;m seeing you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.209" end="00:13:08.550" style="s2">we&#39;re using that to connect more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.330" end="00:13:11.070" style="s2">through many different levels of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.550" end="00:13:12.860" style="s2">mind and body to each other so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.070" end="00:13:16.130" style="s2">develop a tremendous sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.860" end="00:13:20.280" style="s2">connectedness and a car because it</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.130" end="00:13:22.080" style="s2">because this sounds sort of trivial but</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.280" end="00:13:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s really actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.080" end="00:13:27.030" style="s2">the transformations that were often</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.840" end="00:13:28.710" style="s2">seeking in conversation are not</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.030" end="00:13:31.350" style="s2">fundamentally transformations of belief</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.710" end="00:13:33.750" style="s2">the transformations of our sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.350" end="00:13:35.580" style="s2">our sense of how to be with other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.750" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">our perspectival knowing our</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.580" end="00:13:40.620" style="s2">participatory knowing and so circling is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:43.200" style="s2">a way of trying to reformulate how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.620" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">practice conversation so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.200" end="00:13:47.910" style="s2">giving an emphasis on giving people</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:49.890" style="s2">propositions obviously you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:51.840" style="s2">but what you&#39;re primarily trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.890" end="00:13:54.330" style="s2">is create something like this mutual</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.840" end="00:13:56.550" style="s2">flow between you and other people so</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.330" end="00:13:58.860" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to tap into right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.550" end="00:14:01.260" style="s2">the emergent collect the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.860" end="00:14:03.030" style="s2">collective intelligence between people</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.260" end="00:14:05.220" style="s2">the intelligence within distributed</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.030" end="00:14:06.510" style="s2">cognition rather than within individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.220" end="00:14:08.250" style="s2">brains you know the way like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.510" end="00:14:10.950" style="s2">internet networks computers together</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.250" end="00:14:13.320" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to network brains together</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.950" end="00:14:15.840" style="s2">so they&#39;re forming this sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.320" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">tight distributed cognition a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.840" end="00:14:20.310" style="s2">system and that&#39;s what your ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">that will ultimately afford a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.310" end="00:14:24.600" style="s2">kind of trend transformation in people</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:26.270" style="s2">then just trying to convince them of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.600" end="00:14:27.420" style="s2">particular conclusions within</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.820" end="00:14:36.360" style="s2">circling and then reintegrate it back in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.540" end="00:14:38.430" style="s2">with argumentation because Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.360" end="00:14:40.260" style="s2">able to do both he was able to create</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.430" end="00:14:42.090" style="s2">that sort of mid we called it midwifing</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.260" end="00:14:44.460" style="s2">helping people to give birth to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.090" end="00:14:45.810" style="s2">themselves right which was always deeply</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.180" end="00:14:51.630" style="s2">also did it within the context of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.620" end="00:14:54.360" style="s2">argumentation which is again not</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.630" end="00:14:55.320" style="s2">directed towards winning it&#39;s so what</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.360" end="00:14:57.240" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is use the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.320" end="00:14:59.700" style="s2">connectedness between you and me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.240" end="00:15:01.500" style="s2">then bring that into an argument ation</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.700" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">that is directed towards getting us more</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.500" end="00:15:08.760" style="s2">deeply connected to wisdom virtue</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:12.180" style="s2">reality is very interesting as something</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.760" end="00:15:14.730" style="s2">related to martial arts so that I had</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.180" end="00:15:16.890" style="s2">been noticed and after the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.730" end="00:15:19.460" style="s2">with you in the information that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.890" end="00:15:23.810" style="s2">have been sharing that something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.460" end="00:15:23.810" style="s2">understand thought anew we spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.020" end="00:15:32.930" style="s2">on the hero&#39;s journey it happens as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.790" end="00:15:34.840" style="s2">working with competition on combat you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.930" end="00:15:37.840" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.840" end="00:15:40.300" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s let&#39;s see how I put it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.840" end="00:15:45.400" style="s2">I have to say it very carefully as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.300" end="00:15:50.950" style="s2">because when when you have a young</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.400" end="00:15:55.029" style="s2">athlete it&#39;s time a sport in general so</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.950" end="00:15:57.339" style="s2">the is because he&#39;s young because for</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.029" end="00:16:00.339" style="s2">being the best he will travel she would</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.339" end="00:16:03.040" style="s2">try to be the best as possible in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.339" end="00:16:07.029" style="s2">sport and as good as he he or she can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.040" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">so we&#39;ll try to be the best in being the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.029" end="00:16:13.390" style="s2">best so you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to win so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">your your your focus on your goals is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.390" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">winning from point A to B it&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:25.089" style="s2">best but then there&#39;s one element that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:27.820" style="s2">believe that eighty stays out but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.089" end="00:16:30.270" style="s2">it the motivation and the meaning in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.820" end="00:16:35.110" style="s2">the the practice itself would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.270" end="00:16:37.650" style="s2">becoming the best but compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.110" end="00:16:41.140" style="s2">people compared to a set number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.650" end="00:16:44.890" style="s2">elements but not necessarily not</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.140" end="00:16:50.430" style="s2">necessarily will be being my best of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.890" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">myself yes it may be connected sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.430" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">but you&#39;re not intentionally I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.130" end="00:17:03.220" style="s2">experienced it I believe that they you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.300" end="00:17:07.030" style="s2">can try to give the best of yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.220" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">a specific trade or the best on in one</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.030" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">sport but not necessarily you may you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:18.130" style="s2">will not necessarily be transferred in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">the best being you can be yes I agree</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.130" end="00:17:22.390" style="s2">with that I think that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.260" style="s2">point that Andersen brought up and thank</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.390" end="00:17:27.160" style="s2">you for pointing that out</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.260" end="00:17:31.060" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s interesting because and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.160" end="00:17:33.580" style="s2">that has to do and with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.060" end="00:17:37.000" style="s2">degree to which we how should we take</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">the hero&#39;s journey within the martial</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.000" end="00:17:44.140" style="s2">arts and I know Rafe Kelly is again</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:45.550" style="s2">doing work on this explicitly but when</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.140" end="00:17:47.980" style="s2">you set up what you said brings out a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.550" end="00:17:48.730" style="s2">really important point and that goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.980" end="00:17:50.260" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.730" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">they have been doing quite a bit of work</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.260" end="00:17:56.980" style="s2">on recently which is trying to try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:58.870" style="s2">build on the work of La Paul and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.980" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">transformative experience and Agnes Cal</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.870" end="00:18:04.660" style="s2">art and aspiration right where you may</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:08.260" style="s2">think that there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.660" end="00:18:10.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me there&#39;s sort of this way</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.260" end="00:18:12.790" style="s2">in she can frame the hero&#39;s journey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.510" end="00:18:17.190" style="s2">going to defeat all of my opponents I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.790" end="00:18:19.960" style="s2">going to defeat all of my peers right</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.190" end="00:18:22.330" style="s2">but there you could also think of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.960" end="00:18:25.420" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey as an aspirational one</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.330" end="00:18:28.090" style="s2">which is there&#39;s a future self that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.420" end="00:18:32.590" style="s2">want to be and I&#39;m not currently that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.090" end="00:18:35.770" style="s2">self right this is a self that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.590" end="00:18:38.440" style="s2">has perspectives and virtues and prep</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.770" end="00:18:40.990" style="s2">and preferences that I don&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.440" end="00:18:44.410" style="s2">is perhaps and wiser self or a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.990" end="00:18:46.870" style="s2">rational self or a more virtuous self</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.410" end="00:18:48.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s a different that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.870" end="00:18:50.860" style="s2">different hero&#39;s journey because now the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.970" end="00:18:53.140" style="s2">relationship is between your current</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.860" end="00:18:55.150" style="s2">self and your future self and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.140" end="00:18:57.400" style="s2">a very different thing because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.150" end="00:19:00.460" style="s2">skills you need to build are not just</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.400" end="00:19:02.980" style="s2">the skills of combat or the skills let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.460" end="00:19:04.570" style="s2">call them the skills of victory you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.980" end="00:19:09.730" style="s2">to but you need to build up these</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.570" end="00:19:11.950" style="s2">important skills that peak like I&#39;m this</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.730" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">agent right now in this particular arena</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.950" end="00:19:16.300" style="s2">this is this is who I am and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:18.580" style="s2">I see and understand the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.300" end="00:19:20.710" style="s2">want to be that person you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.580" end="00:19:22.420" style="s2">to use space to refer to time right I</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.710" end="00:19:24.070" style="s2">want to be that person over there a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.420" end="00:19:25.390" style="s2">different person living in a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.070" end="00:19:27.400" style="s2">world is why people go into therapy</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.390" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">right they want to be a different person</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.400" end="00:19:32.260" style="s2">and living in a different world they</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.260" end="00:19:34.990" style="s2">want to write and so their skills I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.260" end="00:19:36.940" style="s2">get the skills of moving between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.990" end="00:19:40.540" style="s2">in this existential sensible world are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.940" end="00:19:43.480" style="s2">not the same skills as combat they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.540" end="00:19:45.220" style="s2">not the same skills as common you as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.480" end="00:19:47.230" style="s2">and I agree with you I think you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.220" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">develop your skills of combat and be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.230" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">best in that sense but if you have not</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:55.270" style="s2">engaged in a lot of the processes that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:57.670" style="s2">talked about the inactive analogy and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.270" end="00:19:59.260" style="s2">Gog aid of serious play this is all in</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.670" end="00:20:01.450" style="s2">my series for people who want to take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.260" end="00:20:02.230" style="s2">deeper look at these ideas but if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.450" end="00:20:04.440" style="s2">don&#39;t cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.230" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">the skill let&#39;s call them the skills of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.440" end="00:20:08.919" style="s2">transformation that trans frame used</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:10.870" style="s2">from one world to another</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:13.630" style="s2">you can have your combat skills at a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.870" end="00:20:18.370" style="s2">very high level and that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.630" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve aspired very much at all right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.370" end="00:20:30.330" style="s2">I agree with you that if people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:34.690" style="s2">trying to incorporate the hero mythos</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.330" end="00:20:38.020" style="s2">into their martial practice they should</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.690" end="00:20:41.799" style="s2">sit down and reflect well which way do I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.020" end="00:20:43.870" style="s2">want it do I want it this way like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.799" end="00:20:46.510" style="s2">know I just want to be able to defeat my</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.870" end="00:20:48.730" style="s2">contemporaries is that the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.510" end="00:20:51.940" style="s2">journey on I&#39;m on or is the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.730" end="00:20:55.570" style="s2">journey right I want to I want to move</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.940" end="00:20:57.490" style="s2">to that person in that world and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.570" end="00:20:58.360" style="s2">because then what you have to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.490" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">have to do with what we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.360" end="00:21:02.530" style="s2">about earlier dandro you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.260" style="s2">about cultivating all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.530" end="00:21:08.020" style="s2">things so you can develop the skills of</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.020" end="00:21:15.370" style="s2">just the skills of combat and follow up</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.950" end="00:21:18.220" style="s2">on this think it&#39;s all thinking about my</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.370" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">previous experiences as well do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.220" end="00:21:30.700" style="s2">think that you you have you have said</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.590" end="00:26:42.549" style="s2">question and for the context of martial</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.210" end="00:26:45.780" style="s2">arts</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.549" end="00:26:51.340" style="s2">I realized that there is love of</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.340" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2">be tamed somehow or controlled and in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.260" end="00:27:04.890" style="s2">this specific aspect and and then okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.000" end="00:27:10.659" style="s2">so martial arts may be a solution</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.450" end="00:32:38.200" style="s2">was a very helpful sort of case study of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.340" end="00:32:40.629" style="s2">you know that that kind of shift that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.200" end="00:32:42.639" style="s2">was interested in that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.629" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">that&#39;s very good thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.639" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">would you like to talk about your next</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:54.909" style="s2">video serious I&#39;m very curious about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:58.330" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about these ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.909" end="00:33:00.070" style="s2">practices yeah right and then in</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.330" end="00:33:02.739" style="s2">discussions I&#39;ve had with Jordan Hall he</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.070" end="00:33:03.940" style="s2">said to me well you actually you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.739" end="00:33:06.700" style="s2">actually said you need sort of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.940" end="00:33:10.210" style="s2">psycho technology that is gonna help you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.700" end="00:33:11.980" style="s2">you know choose and select and curate</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.210" end="00:33:14.649" style="s2">and coordinate your ecology so a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.980" end="00:33:16.530" style="s2">Shepherd psychology and that was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.649" end="00:33:18.450" style="s2">yeah that makes a lot of sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.530" end="00:33:19.560" style="s2">and then I said well the primary thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.450" end="00:33:21.960" style="s2">that needs to do is it needs to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.560" end="00:33:23.820" style="s2">something analogous to what you know so</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.960" end="00:33:25.740" style="s2">we have practices that take individual</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.820" end="00:33:27.960" style="s2">intelligence and sort of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.740" end="00:33:30.840" style="s2">ratchet them up and do rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.960" end="00:33:32.670" style="s2">then ratchet them up into wisdom we need</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.840" end="00:33:33.930" style="s2">a practice that&#39;s gonna take collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.670" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">intelligence and lift it up into</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.930" end="00:33:37.670" style="s2">collective rationality and collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:40.680" style="s2">wisdom because that collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.670" end="00:33:42.600" style="s2">will give us the guidance we need for</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.680" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">ecologies of practices and then I</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.600" end="00:33:47.250" style="s2">thought well wait a sec I know of such a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:49.650" style="s2">practice in the ancient world it was the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.250" end="00:33:51.960" style="s2">Platonic notion of dialectic dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.650" end="00:33:54.930" style="s2">was kind of a meta psycho technology in</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.960" end="00:33:56.340" style="s2">which you did and that&#39;s it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.930" end="00:33:57.870" style="s2">has to do with Socrates which is what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.340" end="00:34:00.060" style="s2">were talking about earlier you use this</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.870" end="00:34:01.530" style="s2">sort of looping between you and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.060" end="00:34:03.180" style="s2">remember we were talking about that kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.530" end="00:34:04.560" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on encircling but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.180" end="00:34:06.300" style="s2">also have this thing where you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.560" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">to get deeply more deeply aware of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.300" end="00:34:10.169" style="s2">yourself deeply aware of the other and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:13.110" style="s2">then they&#39;re using to try and get a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.169" end="00:34:16.139" style="s2">deeper understanding of you know what it</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.110" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">what is wisdom what is what is it to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.139" end="00:34:20.909" style="s2">in contact with reality where you you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:24.149" style="s2">you you really try to again in dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.909" end="00:34:27.179" style="s2">using collective wisdom you try to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.149" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2">the the deepest kind of transformations</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.179" end="00:34:32.520" style="s2">of your awareness and of who and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.270" end="00:34:35.639" style="s2">you are possible so that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.520" end="00:34:37.470" style="s2">what the dialectic was dialectic was in</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.639" end="00:34:39.540" style="s2">the neo platonic tradition it was both</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.470" end="00:34:41.159" style="s2">something you did individually in sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.540" end="00:34:42.600" style="s2">of a contemplative meditative way and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.159" end="00:34:46.190" style="s2">then you did is i illogically with</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.600" end="00:34:51.090" style="s2">others and so it was this way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.190" end="00:34:53.960" style="s2">to coordinate dialogues such that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.090" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">could deeply improve self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.960" end="00:34:58.200" style="s2">knowledge of the other so you get more</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:34:59.790" style="s2">deeply connected to yourself more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.200" end="00:35:02.580" style="s2">connected to others and then together we</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.790" end="00:35:04.680" style="s2">get more deeply connected to how reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.580" end="00:35:07.740" style="s2">itself is unfolding the idea is the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.680" end="00:35:11.310" style="s2">conversation sort of unfolds the way it</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.740" end="00:35:14.310" style="s2">opens us up gives us deep clues into how</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.310" end="00:35:17.340" style="s2">reality is unfolding and opening itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.310" end="00:35:19.350" style="s2">up and so what I thought was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.340" end="00:35:21.630" style="s2">following there&#39;s been a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.350" end="00:35:24.210" style="s2">work on what was happening around</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.630" end="00:35:27.180" style="s2">Socrates because he&#39;s the he&#39;s the hero</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.210" end="00:35:28.110" style="s2">of this practice right and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.180" end="00:35:29.820" style="s2">thought is well I&#39;m going to truly</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.110" end="00:35:30.270" style="s2">really try to understand Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.820" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">the peep</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.270" end="00:35:34.050" style="s2">that immediately came after him and how</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:36.630" style="s2">they especially the Neoplatonic position</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.050" end="00:35:38.820" style="s2">how they developed this practice of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.630" end="00:35:40.920" style="s2">dialectic and then once I get it clear</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.820" end="00:35:42.120" style="s2">and so I&#39;m going to use episodes on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.920" end="00:35:44.340" style="s2">trying to get really clear on what that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.120" end="00:35:45.810" style="s2">is I&#39;m gonna use that as a template and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.340" end="00:35:48.810" style="s2">then I&#39;m gonna bring it into dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.810" end="00:35:51.840" style="s2">with all these emerging practices like</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.810" end="00:35:53.970" style="s2">circling empathy circling authentic</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.840" end="00:35:56.100" style="s2">relating the anti debate of Peter</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.970" end="00:35:57.570" style="s2">Lambert you know insight dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.100" end="00:36:01.020" style="s2">came out of the Buddhist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.570" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">there&#39;s all these emerging practices of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.020" end="00:36:04.140" style="s2">discourse on authentic relating and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:06.600" style="s2">what I want to do is I want to take the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.140" end="00:36:08.850" style="s2">Socratic template and integrate it with</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.600" end="00:36:11.730" style="s2">the current practices and try make</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.850" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">something that would be powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.730" end="00:36:16.710" style="s2">effective as a matter sico technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">for helping to curate the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.710" end="00:36:20.730" style="s2">practices in response to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying very</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.730" end="00:36:27.360" style="s2">interesing and follow-up question is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:31.260" style="s2">this related to the concept that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.360" end="00:36:37.470" style="s2">exploring religion of no religion very</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.260" end="00:36:40.430" style="s2">much very much I think that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.470" end="00:36:46.290" style="s2">what sort of dialectic dialogue right</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.430" end="00:36:52.980" style="s2">that I&#39;m trying to get out is going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.290" end="00:36:54.540" style="s2">be needed very much for what Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.980" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">and I are talking about in the religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.540" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.110" style="s2">trying to found a religion I keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:03.030" style="s2">that so people don&#39;t get confused well</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.540" end="00:37:22.410" style="s2">spiritual in a sense but not necessarily</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.410" end="00:37:27.390" style="s2">religion this is happening more and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.360" end="00:37:30.120" style="s2">and more we need a way for people to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.390" end="00:37:32.730" style="s2">talk to each other so they can network</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.120" end="00:37:35.730" style="s2">so they can coordinate and so they can</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.730" end="00:37:40.770" style="s2">other&#39;s ecologies of practices that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">what this kind of dialectic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.770" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">would do for us it would be with</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.510" end="00:37:48.190" style="s2">it would it would get us a way to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:49.900" style="s2">what was need is we need we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.190" end="00:37:52.150" style="s2">forms of dialogue that cut through the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.900" end="00:37:54.369" style="s2"> and the self-deception so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.150" end="00:37:55.990" style="s2">we can start making the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.369" end="00:37:57.880" style="s2">connections that make a new culture</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.990" end="00:37:59.859" style="s2">because the new culture is trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.880" end="00:38:02.080" style="s2">born and this is a way of trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.859" end="00:38:05.290" style="s2">that happen then it&#39;s not it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.080" end="00:38:06.369" style="s2">very different from both the failed</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">although they&#39;ll be deep continuities</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.500" end="00:38:18.010" style="s2">but it&#39;ll have some important</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:21.160" style="s2">differences from the axial age religions</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.010" end="00:38:23.830" style="s2">that most people now find non-viable</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.160" end="00:38:26.050" style="s2">okay so at this point I I do have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.830" end="00:38:27.820" style="s2">this question but more for much for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.050" end="00:38:30.030" style="s2">listeners also because I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.820" end="00:38:32.500" style="s2">this and I heard I heard you comment and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.030" end="00:38:36.760" style="s2">forgive me if I&#39;m asking you that other</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.760" end="00:38:42.940" style="s2">I understand their concept however</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.790" end="00:38:46.540" style="s2">however there is their established</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.540" end="00:38:54.250" style="s2">they they they did they try to address</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.380" end="00:38:57.820" style="s2">the same questions in in another way why</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.250" end="00:39:01.840" style="s2">not use and I will make a note who I not</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.820" end="00:39:03.580" style="s2">not use them as a basis for instances</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.650" end="00:39:17.800" style="s2">answered this question yeah I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.540" end="00:39:19.660" style="s2">happy the answered again by the way I</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.580" end="00:39:25.540" style="s2">seem to like it but when I when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.830" end="00:39:26.260" style="s2">him playing it I liked it but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.540" end="00:39:31.660" style="s2">needs to be improved</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.260" end="00:39:34.869" style="s2">there&#39;s in one sense the I I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.660" end="00:39:37.900" style="s2">very much the case that individuals can</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.869" end="00:39:39.700" style="s2">turn to a religion and enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.900" end="00:39:42.160" style="s2">transformative relationship with it I</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.700" end="00:39:45.310" style="s2">think right such that they can cultivate</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.310" end="00:39:50.970" style="s2">life I yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.190" end="00:39:54.040" style="s2">they can&#39;t there&#39;s no question okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.970" end="00:39:55.810" style="s2">what what but there&#39;s two things we also</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.040" end="00:39:57.270" style="s2">have to pay attention to but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.810" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">growing number of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.270" end="00:40:03.060" style="s2">the air no NES for which that is not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:06.030" style="s2">case they do they write that they find</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.060" end="00:40:07.740" style="s2">that they it&#39;s just not viable to them</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:09.450" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t catch it doesn&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.740" end="00:40:11.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for them and this leads me</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.450" end="00:40:14.130" style="s2">to the second point part of what I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.490" end="00:40:18.630" style="s2">and I try to give a long argument for</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.130" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">this in the series is that that that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.630" end="00:40:23.160" style="s2">lot of the established religions came</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:24.990" style="s2">out of the axial revolution right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.160" end="00:40:27.030" style="s2">Christianity is much later but it makes</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.990" end="00:40:29.120" style="s2">use of a lot of the axial ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.030" end="00:40:32.550" style="s2">ancient Greece and ancient Hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.120" end="00:40:34.050" style="s2">cultures right and the thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.550" end="00:40:36.510" style="s2">axial age religions is they have this</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.050" end="00:40:39.450" style="s2">two worlds mythology right there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.510" end="00:40:41.430" style="s2">real world or the illusory world there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.450" end="00:40:43.350" style="s2">the heavenly world or the decayed world</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.430" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">right there&#39;s nirvana</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.350" end="00:40:47.880" style="s2">so I&#39;m sorry like there&#39;s all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:53.100" style="s2">the this contrast now the thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.880" end="00:40:56.130" style="s2">is the history you write the history of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.100" end="00:40:58.890" style="s2">the West I would argue since you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.130" end="00:41:03.930" style="s2">maybe the 12th century is been a whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.890" end="00:41:06.750" style="s2">bunch of processes have undermined that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.930" end="00:41:09.360" style="s2">two worlds idea so that most people find</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.750" end="00:41:13.050" style="s2">the two worlds way of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.360" end="00:41:16.320" style="s2">talking that is sort of prevalent it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.050" end="00:41:20.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t link up with that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.320" end="00:41:26.550" style="s2">the scientific historical worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.970" end="00:41:27.930" style="s2">in which they dwell so and think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.550" end="00:41:29.700" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing now you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.930" end="00:41:31.800" style="s2">different part of the world than I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.700" end="00:41:34.620" style="s2">and we&#39;re relying on very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.800" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">technology and then you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.620" end="00:41:39.600" style="s2">know and we&#39;re coordinating it all with</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:42.120" style="s2">very sophisticated AI right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.600" end="00:41:43.860" style="s2">making and and and like all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.120" end="00:41:46.020" style="s2">and letting let the many really deep in</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.860" end="00:41:48.420" style="s2">that point we are natural-born cyborgs</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.020" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">this is an T Clarke&#39;s point across many</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.420" end="00:41:53.670" style="s2">species we have evolved to deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:55.950" style="s2">integrate with technology we are we we</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.670" end="00:41:59.730" style="s2">don&#39;t just use technology we identify it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.950" end="00:42:02.550" style="s2">and internalize it right and so this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.730" end="00:42:03.690" style="s2">it&#39;s this this whole historical process</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.550" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">has been happening across centuries</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.690" end="00:42:08.950" style="s2">there&#39;s now seeping into people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:11.240" style="s2">seeping into people&#39;s bones right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.950" end="00:42:13.550" style="s2">then let me give an example everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.240" end="00:42:16.310" style="s2">thinks that it&#39;s just natural to talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.550" end="00:42:17.750" style="s2">about well my unconscious right and blah</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.310" end="00:42:20.060" style="s2">blah this is oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.750" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">you know maybe unconsciously that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.060" end="00:42:23.390" style="s2">Freud you don&#39;t talk that way before</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:27.620" style="s2">Freud you know you probably believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.390" end="00:42:30.350" style="s2">never read Freud you know and but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.620" end="00:42:33.320" style="s2">Freud has insinuated a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.350" end="00:42:35.120" style="s2">and you know and that way is also Freud</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.320" end="00:42:36.470" style="s2">at least thought it was because he</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.120" end="00:42:37.460" style="s2">thought of himself as an atheist it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.470" end="00:42:39.470" style="s2">sort of linked to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.460" end="00:42:40.070" style="s2">understanding of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.470" end="00:42:41.390" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.070" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying Freud is right that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.390" end="00:42:46.070" style="s2">my point Leandro what I&#39;m trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:50.390" style="s2">is that our cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.070" end="00:42:55.370" style="s2">has made for made many people incapable</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.390" end="00:42:59.300" style="s2">of acting within the two worlds grammar</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.370" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">of the axial age religions they they</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.300" end="00:43:04.040" style="s2">they they can&#39;t sort of it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:06.200" style="s2">you think they feel that it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.040" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">performative contradiction like that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.200" end="00:43:10.790" style="s2">that&#39;s and let&#39;s mean I said about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not because like you know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.790" end="00:43:15.080" style="s2">all become sort of hard-nosed rational</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:17.870" style="s2">atheists though they believe in with</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.080" end="00:43:19.910" style="s2">strange and wonky things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.870" end="00:43:22.370" style="s2">very hungry for spiritual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.910" end="00:43:25.730" style="s2">and they liable to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.370" end="00:43:29.060" style="s2">psychedelics but they somehow find that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.730" end="00:43:31.430" style="s2">that when a of thinking that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.060" end="00:43:34.310" style="s2">programmer is moribund for them and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.430" end="00:43:36.260" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s why they are turning</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.310" end="00:43:38.360" style="s2">to generate we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.260" end="00:43:40.190" style="s2">explain why all this generativity why</p>
