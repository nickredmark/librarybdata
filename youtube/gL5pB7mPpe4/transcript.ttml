<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">well it was just a very fortunate</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.109" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">was no programming language so you had</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">had to set all the ones and zeros and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:39.540" style="s2">learned that skill in order to program a</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">very clever</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:11.639" style="s2">he just had no money to pull it off and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">so he went begging and people began</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.639" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">giving</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:17.009" style="s2">things such as this old computer and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:20.130" style="s2">came to my office with a copy of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.130" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">study design workshop that was looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.789" end="00:04:27.810" style="s2">at what you might do to detect</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.810" end="00:04:32.669" style="s2">unlimited funds and he gave me the</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.669" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">wanted me to join his team so that i</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:02.340" style="s2">so I got hooked and I stayed out wow</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:04.590" style="s2">that&#39;s so lucky did you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.340" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">think about the big questions in science</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.590" end="00:05:08.009" style="s2">and that&#39;s something at the Santa Fe</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.009" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">the last eighteen years so we try to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.169" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">what are the big questions in my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">ranking I put SETI question as number</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.300" end="00:05:22.650" style="s2">two number one for you number one is why</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">does this universe exist and after that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.650" end="00:05:28.260" style="s2">I think SETI is number two and of the -</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">I think SETI is the more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.260" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">accessible to an answer in a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">time frame and a humanly potential level</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:38.130" style="s2">of effort but I also think it has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">gigantic moral component which I often</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.130" end="00:05:45.169" style="s2">don&#39;t see talked about is that what one</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:48.949" style="s2">level if the galaxy and the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.169" end="00:05:51.659" style="s2">relatively abundant in intelligent life</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.949" end="00:05:53.669" style="s2">then that means we&#39;re one of many and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.659" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">while we have a duty to protect</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.810" end="00:06:03.930" style="s2">universe itself however should it turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.139" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">out that we are alone and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.930" end="00:06:08.669" style="s2">when I was a 12 year old nerdy guy who</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:10.979" style="s2">you know stumbled up on astronomy in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.979" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">knew at the time I said</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.780" end="00:06:34.610" style="s2">that we have a huge moral duty to the</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.630" end="00:07:19.460" style="s2">it&#39;s been an incredible roller coaster</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.219" end="00:08:05.900" style="s2">we&#39;re all the same and I think that</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.900" end="00:08:11.419" style="s2">randomly important over the coming</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.889" end="00:08:27.830" style="s2">them globally and so if I can help other</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.919" end="00:08:30.500" style="s2">humans have this larger point of view</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.830" end="00:08:32.539" style="s2">this this cosmic perspective they think</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.500" end="00:08:34.460" style="s2">that goes a long way to finding the</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.460" end="00:08:38.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.020" end="00:08:40.550" style="s2">and certainly particularly relevant in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.510" end="00:08:42.909" style="s2">our current time when it sort of seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.550" end="00:08:45.350" style="s2">like tribalism is making a big comeback</p>

<p begin="00:08:45.350" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">saying you know on the on the scale of</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.620" end="00:09:04.010" style="s2">realize that we are all life on Earth is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:05.450" style="s2">probably very close cousins compared to</p>

<p begin="00:09:09.410" end="00:09:13.220" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very very healthy idea to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.510" end="00:09:16.190" style="s2">put out into the world let&#39;s switch back</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.220" end="00:09:18.740" style="s2">now to SETI science a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">directly the Drake Equation has long</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.740" end="00:09:23.570" style="s2">been the touchstone for thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:25.670" style="s2">SETI could you take us through it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.570" end="00:09:27.500" style="s2">maybe tell us the the points in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.670" end="00:09:29.570" style="s2">Drake Equation and maybe even a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.500" end="00:09:31.400" style="s2">bit about what we know about them sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.570" end="00:09:33.830" style="s2">but let&#39;s start out with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.400" end="00:09:36.350" style="s2">the Drake Equation is actually a great</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.830" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">agenda for a meeting but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.350" end="00:09:41.060" style="s2">calculate anything with it there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:44.060" style="s2">too many unknowns but Frank Drake when</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:47.900" style="s2">holding a meeting on this topic way back</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.060" end="00:09:50.810" style="s2">in 1961 did put together an agenda and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.900" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">he thought about all of the factors the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.810" end="00:09:56.150" style="s2">things that you would have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">in order to try and estimate the number</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.150" end="00:10:00.830" style="s2">of communicative civilizations that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:02.330" style="s2">could be out there in the Milky Way and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.830" end="00:10:04.490" style="s2">he started with the rate of star</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.330" end="00:10:06.830" style="s2">formation because we think stars are</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.490" end="00:10:09.050" style="s2">needed to have planets and then we</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.830" end="00:10:11.370" style="s2">wanted he wanted to know the fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.050" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">stars that actually had planets</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.370" end="00:10:16.140" style="s2">remember it&#39;s only been the last decade</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.960" style="s2">or so that we know about planets around</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.140" end="00:10:21.660" style="s2">other stars back then we had no clue and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.960" end="00:10:24.330" style="s2">then he asked well in a planetary system</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.660" end="00:10:26.400" style="s2">what&#39;s the average number of planets</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.330" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">like the earth that could be habitable</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.400" end="00:10:31.830" style="s2">and in in our solar system he would have</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:34.680" style="s2">said three you know Morris Earth and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.830" end="00:10:37.860" style="s2">Venus might have been good ideas for for</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.680" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">life and then of those good planets what</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.860" end="00:10:42.930" style="s2">fraction of them actually does life</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.110" end="00:10:45.450" style="s2">begin on and of all the life starts what</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.930" end="00:10:50.430" style="s2">fraction of those develop intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.450" end="00:10:52.980" style="s2">and of the intelligent species out there</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.430" end="00:10:56.180" style="s2">what fraction of them develop a culture</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:10:59.070" style="s2">and a civilization and lastly how long</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.180" end="00:11:02.010" style="s2">does that technological civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.070" end="00:11:04.590" style="s2">last because if civilizations arise</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.010" end="00:11:06.630" style="s2">develop technology and do themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.590" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">or turn themselves off very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.630" end="00:11:11.580" style="s2">there&#39;s not likely to be anybody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:14.940" style="s2">going to be close enough and Co temporal</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.580" end="00:11:17.610" style="s2">with us that is around at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.940" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">in the ten billion year history of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.610" end="00:11:21.720" style="s2">galaxy so he multiplied all those</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.970" style="s2">factors together and put in his own</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.720" end="00:11:25.800" style="s2">favorite numbers and came out with with</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.970" end="00:11:28.110" style="s2">ten thousand and people have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.800" end="00:11:30.750" style="s2">arguing about the numbers ever since a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.110" end="00:11:34.410" style="s2">couple of summers ago the folks over in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.750" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">Oxford who loved Bayesian calculations</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.410" end="00:11:40.920" style="s2">looked at all the literature on this</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:44.400" style="s2">topic and said within the literature for</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.920" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">the fraction of planets that actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.400" end="00:11:50.070" style="s2">life starts on the probability of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:53.990" style="s2">abiogenesis they said there were a</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.330" end="00:12:04.200" style="s2">ascribed to that factor and in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.930" end="00:12:06.990" style="s2">we have no idea and a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.200" end="00:12:09.960" style="s2">philip morris and told me he&#39;s a pioneer</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.990" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">one of the pioneers in SETI told me that</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:21.030" style="s2">the exponent is a topic that isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.300" end="00:12:23.310" style="s2">to yield to theory it&#39;s one that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.030" end="00:12:24.329" style="s2">to have to be solved I&#39;ve understood</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.910" end="00:12:30.809" style="s2">believe that&#39;s the case with SETI we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:33.029" style="s2">sit on a mountaintop and stare at our</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.029" end="00:12:37.559" style="s2">but what&#39;s gonna answer this question is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.059" end="00:12:39.209" style="s2">observation at least until we have more</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.559" end="00:12:41.869" style="s2">data and you know and it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.209" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">bootstrap like as you pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.869" end="00:12:45.329" style="s2">actually I laughed when I went back and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:46.980" style="s2">looked at the Drake Equation it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.329" end="00:12:49.230" style="s2">clear that that must have been stated</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:51.959" style="s2">when the steady state theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.230" end="00:12:54.029" style="s2">universe was still in play the way he</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.959" end="00:12:56.939" style="s2">talked about planetary formation I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.029" end="00:12:59.790" style="s2">thought was interesting if he had been</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.790" end="00:13:03.749" style="s2">of the world he might not have stated it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.199" end="00:13:05.999" style="s2">quite that way and also as you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.749" end="00:13:07.290" style="s2">out we had no clue about the number of</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.580" end="00:14:44.110" style="s2">up and then the next thing we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.590" end="00:14:46.840" style="s2">coming up are the atmospheric studies of</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.450" end="00:15:06.730" style="s2">atmospheres is going to be very nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.810" end="00:15:10.690" style="s2">there is no smoking gun that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.730" end="00:15:13.630" style="s2">able to postulate yet and so it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.690" end="00:15:17.470" style="s2">to be very much a result that depends on</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.630" end="00:15:19.870" style="s2">context the age of the stellar system</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.470" end="00:15:23.290" style="s2">and the planetary system and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.870" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">location relative to the star and if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.290" end="00:15:27.940" style="s2">think about the Earth&#39;s atmosphere early</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:30.310" style="s2">in its history our Earth&#39;s atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.940" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">was dominated by methane coming from</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.310" end="00:15:35.650" style="s2">methanogens but then we had 2.4 billion</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">years ago this great oxygenation event</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.650" end="00:15:41.320" style="s2">&#39;ln blue-green algae figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:43.300" style="s2">do photosynthesis and produce oxygen as</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.320" end="00:15:47.230" style="s2">a by-product and then we change the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.300" end="00:15:49.860" style="s2">atmosphere completely and so while there</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.230" end="00:15:53.170" style="s2">was life on Earth in both of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.860" end="00:15:55.950" style="s2">variants the atmospheric trace gases</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.170" end="00:15:58.300" style="s2">were completely different so</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.950" end="00:16:01.300" style="s2">understanding in context for the planets</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.300" end="00:16:03.580" style="s2">evolution is going to be necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.300" end="00:16:05.950" style="s2">very hard to do as we make the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.580" end="00:16:08.980" style="s2">spectroscopic searches for various trace</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.950" end="00:16:10.630" style="s2">gases yep well and it&#39;ll drive you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.980" end="00:16:12.580" style="s2">thinking about the theory of how the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.630" end="00:16:14.350" style="s2">earth evolved as well at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.580" end="00:16:16.780" style="s2">as you point out you know to agree that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.350" end="00:16:18.640" style="s2">we can reason from our own experience as</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.780" end="00:16:22.660" style="s2">a plan on how our atmosphere evolved</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.640" end="00:16:25.660" style="s2">over you know 3.5 or 4 billion years we</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.660" end="00:16:28.090" style="s2">may be may provide us some models which</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.660" end="00:16:30.400" style="s2">would say that atmospheres that look</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.090" end="00:16:31.960" style="s2">like this are probably biotic and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:34.090" style="s2">atmospheres that look like that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.960" end="00:16:37.000" style="s2">not for instance at least something I</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.090" end="00:16:39.700" style="s2">read said that a mixture of oxygen and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.000" end="00:16:42.130" style="s2">methane within certain ratios may be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.700" end="00:16:43.290" style="s2">pretty good indicator a pretty good</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.290" end="00:16:49.100" style="s2">well it&#39;s actually an extremely good</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.720" end="00:16:53.100" style="s2">indicator of chemical disequilibrium and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.100" end="00:16:56.700" style="s2">on our own atmosphere it&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.100" end="00:17:00.390" style="s2">times out of equilibrium so what you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.700" end="00:17:03.210" style="s2">see methane and oxygen you&#39;ll see this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.390" end="00:17:05.220" style="s2">strange chemistry that&#39;s out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.210" end="00:17:09.020" style="s2">equilibrium so something&#39;s forcing it</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.220" end="00:17:13.709" style="s2">but is that something biology or geology</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.020" end="00:17:18.150" style="s2">there are ways to get oxygen that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.709" end="00:17:21.930" style="s2">abiotic right and we don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.150" end="00:17:24.660" style="s2">limits of how much out of equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.930" end="00:17:26.790" style="s2">you can force something without the</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.790" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t yet know do we have i any</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:18.029" style="s2">had such a hard time getting the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.419" end="00:20:20.820" style="s2">scientific community to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.029" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">model so symbiosis is not something we</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.820" end="00:20:27.230" style="s2">were prepared to take on lens word that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:30.330" style="s2">took a lot of hard and painful</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.230" end="00:20:32.760" style="s2">operations on lens part two to get this</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.330" end="00:20:35.450" style="s2">notion across and accepted as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.760" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">know now it&#39;s accepted by everybody yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.450" end="00:20:41.549" style="s2">yeah you know we do a lot of tracking of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:44.010" style="s2">genetic evolution through the model</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.549" end="00:20:46.110" style="s2">mitochondrial DNA right as we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.010" end="00:20:47.820" style="s2">down the maternal line and say alright</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.110" end="00:20:50.010" style="s2">this is what the maternal ancestry look</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.820" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">like separate from the paternal ancestry</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.010" end="00:20:55.350" style="s2">and well but far as I know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:57.389" style="s2">taken as reality now by everybody</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.350" end="00:21:00.090" style="s2">working in the field okay let&#39;s turn a</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.389" end="00:21:03.690" style="s2">little bit from the science and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.090" end="00:21:04.070" style="s2">Drake Equation to policy one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.690" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.070" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">came across in my research was something</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:11.420" style="s2">called the first SETI protocol basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:14.120" style="s2">a protocol for what we do if we think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.420" end="00:21:16.010" style="s2">have a signal and we are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.120" end="00:21:18.200" style="s2">verify it etc because you tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.010" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">little bit about that sure that protocol</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:22.340" style="s2">was written back in the 80s during the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:23.810" style="s2">height of the Cold War and it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.340" end="00:21:26.270" style="s2">written under the auspices of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.810" end="00:21:29.060" style="s2">International Academy of astronautics</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.270" end="00:21:32.900" style="s2">which has had a standing committee on</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.060" end="00:21:35.810" style="s2">SETI for many many decades and back then</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">some of us were concerned that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.810" end="00:21:41.810" style="s2">colleagues in the Soviet Union who were</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">doing SETI searches might succeed in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.810" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">detection but be prevented from making</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:51.820" style="s2">that information public and so we wrote</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:55.190" style="s2">this protocol as a way of encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.820" end="00:21:57.680" style="s2">everybody who was operating and doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.190" end="00:22:01.040" style="s2">SETI searches to have kind of a standard</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.680" end="00:22:04.430" style="s2">way of behaving given success and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.040" end="00:22:06.800" style="s2">basically said you need to verify with</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.430" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">your own instruments that what you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.800" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">you found is what you think it is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">need to try and get independent</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:18.290" style="s2">confirmation quietly without making a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:20.600" style="s2">big fuss so that you can guard against</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.290" end="00:22:24.500" style="s2">intentional hoaxes and then you need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.600" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">tell the world right and at least for</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.500" end="00:22:30.610" style="s2">the signatures of that protocol</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:33.950" style="s2">signatories we agreed that we would not</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.610" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">broadcast a reply until there had been</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.950" end="00:22:41.150" style="s2">some international consensus that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:43.670" style="s2">should do so and a decision about who</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.150" end="00:22:47.690" style="s2">would speak first and what would be sent</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.670" end="00:22:50.270" style="s2">so totally idealistic completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.690" end="00:22:52.940" style="s2">unenforceable but written with the best</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.270" end="00:22:55.640" style="s2">of intentions and hopefully to give our</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.940" end="00:22:57.290" style="s2">Soviet colleagues some backing when they</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.640" end="00:22:59.450" style="s2">wanted to make an announcement if they</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.290" end="00:23:01.910" style="s2">ever succeeded is this protocol still a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.450" end="00:23:04.310" style="s2">live letter in the SETI community I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.910" end="00:23:04.990" style="s2">our new young researchers aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.310" end="00:23:08.169" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.990" end="00:23:11.230" style="s2">for their acculturation into the city</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.169" end="00:23:14.529" style="s2">researcher culture yes it is it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.230" end="00:23:17.260" style="s2">updated the last time about five years</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.529" end="00:23:19.210" style="s2">ago by the International Academy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.260" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">astronautics permanent Study Committee</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.210" end="00:23:25.510" style="s2">and I think that many young people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:28.210" style="s2">are joining the field get told about</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.510" end="00:23:33.070" style="s2">this very early on you know that what</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.210" end="00:23:34.750" style="s2">would I do if I got that signal oh my</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.070" end="00:23:37.990" style="s2">gosh we&#39;ve had a couple of false</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.750" end="00:23:40.120" style="s2">positives over my career and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.990" end="00:23:41.799" style="s2">huge adrenaline high I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.120" end="00:23:43.210" style="s2">imagine what it must be like a minute</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.799" end="00:23:46.630" style="s2">because it&#39;s like as I said it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.210" end="00:23:49.240" style="s2">second greatest discovery possible and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.630" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">you know oh my god is this it have you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.240" end="00:23:56.049" style="s2">personally been involved in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:57.970" style="s2">strong false positives oh yes I&#39;d I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.049" end="00:24:02.020" style="s2">involved at Green Bank West Virginia</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.970" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">back in 1997-98 am I telling us that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.020" end="00:24:06.850" style="s2">story up oh that&#39;s the be hair-raising</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:08.890" style="s2">for me at least yes well at around five</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.850" end="00:24:11.799" style="s2">o&#39;clock in the morning I detected a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.890" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">signal and if you think about what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.799" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">might have looked like the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:19.590" style="s2">looked like a picket fence that is there</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:22.659" style="s2">were narrowband signals strong and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.590" end="00:24:24.730" style="s2">separated by a particular spacing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.659" end="00:24:26.919" style="s2">many of them so it really did look like</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.730" end="00:24:29.860" style="s2">a picket fence on our waterfall display</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.919" end="00:24:32.409" style="s2">I did everything I could think of I</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.860" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">pointed the telescope oh the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.409" end="00:24:38.470" style="s2">beginning of the story actually starts a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">few days before we always did our study</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.470" end="00:24:45.010" style="s2">observing in project Phoenix with two</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:48.419" style="s2">telescopes widely separated by hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.010" end="00:24:51.309" style="s2">of miles then we did this because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.419" end="00:24:54.070" style="s2">were looking for narrowband signals</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.309" end="00:24:57.580" style="s2">which our technology produces quite a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.070" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">lot of and the trick here was that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.580" end="00:25:02.890" style="s2">you use two widely spaced telescopes to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:06.030" style="s2">observe a particular target and you saw</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.890" end="00:25:08.980" style="s2">the signal in both of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.030" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">the signal would actually show up at a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.980" end="00:25:14.670" style="s2">different frequency and different drift</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:17.770" style="s2">rate slightly in the two telescopes</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.670" end="00:25:19.900" style="s2">because of the Earth&#39;s rotation there</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.770" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">would be a differential Doppler</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.900" end="00:25:25.660" style="s2">signature well makes perfect sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:29.110" style="s2">it was a really good way to filter out</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.660" end="00:25:31.530" style="s2">our own technology so lightning struck</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.110" end="00:25:34.990" style="s2">the telescope the second telescope in</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.530" end="00:25:36.850" style="s2">Georgia and we still had the hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.990" end="00:25:39.430" style="s2">forty foot telescope and in Green Bank</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.850" end="00:25:42.250" style="s2">West Virginia and we had time and so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.430" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">continued observing and all we could do</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.250" end="00:25:44.920" style="s2">to try again</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:47.680" style="s2">to discriminate against our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.920" end="00:25:49.930" style="s2">technology was to look at the star and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.680" end="00:25:53.320" style="s2">then look off the star and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.930" end="00:25:54.910" style="s2">really coming from the star then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.320" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">should see it when we look on and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.910" end="00:25:59.230" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t see it when we look off anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:01.450" style="s2">because of a lightning strike we lost a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.230" end="00:26:03.820" style="s2">disk drive of the telescope at Georgia</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.450" end="00:26:06.760" style="s2">it took FedEx a few days to get a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.820" end="00:26:09.550" style="s2">one in there to repair it and we kept</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.760" end="00:26:11.950" style="s2">using the telescope at the National</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.550" end="00:26:14.950" style="s2">Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.950" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">Bank 140 foot and we&#39;d point at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.950" end="00:26:18.460" style="s2">target and then we point off the target</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:20.830" style="s2">and then we come back and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.460" end="00:26:23.650" style="s2">target and we should see a signal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.830" end="00:26:26.140" style="s2">really coming from a distant source on</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.650" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">the sky when we looked at it and we it</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.140" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">should go away when we looked off the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:34.510" style="s2">star and so we did that with this signal</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:36.550" style="s2">and every time I pointed at the target</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.510" end="00:26:39.070" style="s2">the signal was there every time I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.550" end="00:26:39.910" style="s2">pointed the telescope away the signal</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.070" end="00:26:41.920" style="s2">was gone</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.910" end="00:26:44.380" style="s2">this looked like a really good bet and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.920" end="00:26:46.540" style="s2">we started doing all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.380" end="00:26:48.610" style="s2">we had planned like reloading software</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.540" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">to make sure that it somebody had not</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.610" end="00:26:54.460" style="s2">put a signal into our software and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:58.540" style="s2">woke up my colleague and we tracked that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:27:01.300" style="s2">star for another few hours until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.540" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">said and the signal was always there</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.300" end="00:27:05.220" style="s2">when we looked in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">star and never when we looked away</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.220" end="00:27:12.990" style="s2">but we did notice that in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:16.020" style="s2">Doppler shift and rift were appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.990" end="00:27:18.390" style="s2">to a source that was rising to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.020" end="00:27:22.740" style="s2">zenith rather than setting in the West</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.390" end="00:27:26.010" style="s2">and so we knew that it really wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.740" end="00:27:27.660" style="s2">coming from that distant target and at</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.010" end="00:27:31.280" style="s2">this point we had also alerted our</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.660" end="00:27:35.070" style="s2">colleagues in California and they had a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.280" end="00:27:36.450" style="s2">model or a copy of our observing system</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.070" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">and they were watching what we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.450" end="00:27:42.120" style="s2">doing and they were very excited in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:44.450" style="s2">and so we all went off to dinner at</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.120" end="00:27:47.790" style="s2">Green Bank having Duke having made this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.450" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">discovery that it really wasn&#39;t a signal</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.790" end="00:27:53.280" style="s2">from extraterrestrial intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:55.710" style="s2">we forgot to tell our California</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.280" end="00:27:58.980" style="s2">colleagues so they stayed up until about</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.710" end="00:28:01.530" style="s2">when the target rose again expecting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.980" end="00:28:03.630" style="s2">see a signal and I had a lot of fence</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.530" end="00:28:05.880" style="s2">building to do rebuilding to do when I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.630" end="00:28:09.030" style="s2">when I got back to California they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.880" end="00:28:10.950" style="s2">not pleased at all and as soon as I saw</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.030" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">what the parameters of this signal were</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.950" end="00:28:17.670" style="s2">I wrote some code to interrogate the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:20.100" style="s2">database that we keep on all signals</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.670" end="00:28:23.220" style="s2">that are detected to ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.100" end="00:28:25.860" style="s2">had we seen this signal structure before</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.220" end="00:28:28.230" style="s2">coming from some different direction on</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.860" end="00:28:30.750" style="s2">the sky that was a clever thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.230" end="00:28:33.690" style="s2">but I was so excited I mean adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.750" end="00:28:36.420" style="s2">was really unbelievable that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.690" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">take very much care in formatting my</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.420" end="00:28:41.550" style="s2">output and so when I looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:43.530" style="s2">output I missed the fact that indeed we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.550" end="00:28:45.390" style="s2">had seen this signal before from another</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.530" end="00:28:49.710" style="s2">direction could saved ourselves a day of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.390" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">excitement if I been careful and not so</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.710" end="00:28:55.730" style="s2">excited that I screwed up anyway that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:58.200" style="s2">was for me that was probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.730" end="00:29:00.330" style="s2">exciting false positive that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.200" end="00:29:02.310" style="s2">it was actually a good proof that your</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.330" end="00:29:03.540" style="s2">protocols well-designed right because</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.310" end="00:29:06.060" style="s2">despite the fact there a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.540" end="00:29:08.310" style="s2">errors in the process and bad luck of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.060" end="00:29:10.470" style="s2">having your second Observatory down you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.310" end="00:29:12.800" style="s2">still didn&#39;t put out a false</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.470" end="00:29:15.330" style="s2">announcement which I would say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.800" end="00:29:17.100" style="s2">sign that your processes were good</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.330" end="00:29:20.460" style="s2">because that&#39;s a human</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.100" end="00:29:22.820" style="s2">affairs especially catastrophic problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.460" end="00:29:24.929" style="s2">often come when multiple things go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.820" end="00:29:28.110" style="s2">simultaneously so here you had several</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.929" end="00:29:29.580" style="s2">right you at least two and nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.110" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">you protected yourself with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.580" end="00:29:33.510" style="s2">well-designed protocol all right got</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:36.450" style="s2">lucky yeah where you got lucky all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.510" end="00:29:38.070" style="s2">already I&#39;ll take lucky luckily if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.450" end="00:29:41.340" style="s2">have your choice of lucky or smart or</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.070" end="00:29:45.419" style="s2">lucky go for lucky every dime yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.340" end="00:29:48.780" style="s2">fact it was not completely kept quiet</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.419" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">and by accident I had been scheduled to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.780" end="00:29:54.270" style="s2">fly out back to California the noon on</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:56.460" style="s2">the day that I found that signal in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.270" end="00:29:58.140" style="s2">morning so it was too early in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.460" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">California to call my husband and say</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.140" end="00:30:03.659" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna stay out here for a while more</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:06.390" style="s2">so I called our administrative assistant</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.659" end="00:30:08.549" style="s2">and left a voicemail for her saying that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.390" end="00:30:10.919" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t gonna be coming home that day</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.549" end="00:30:14.610" style="s2">and would she&#39;d please tell my husband</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.919" end="00:30:17.100" style="s2">and then during the day and Ryan Carl</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.610" end="00:30:18.809" style="s2">Sagan&#39;s will call to discuss something</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.100" end="00:30:21.179" style="s2">with me and Chris said oh well she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.809" end="00:30:24.900" style="s2">staying in Green Bank a little longer</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.179" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">and from there it went to somehow bill</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.900" end="00:30:29.700" style="s2">brought at the New York Times who called</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">up our colleagues in California and said</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.700" end="00:30:32.970" style="s2">hmm here there&#39;s something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:36.090" style="s2">going on do you want to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.970" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">and sastras tech told him well</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.090" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">no give us another 8 hours and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:42.090" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk to you and he was good enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:44.039" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.090" end="00:30:46.860" style="s2">while back 8 hours later and we had to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.039" end="00:30:48.929" style="s2">say sorry false alarm amazing how a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.860" end="00:30:50.789" style="s2">signal was able to propagate out to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.929" end="00:30:52.830" style="s2">New York Times but that&#39;s the way the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.789" end="00:30:54.450" style="s2">world Majan today with Twitter oh my</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.830" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">goodness even the slightest link would</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.450" end="00:30:59.130" style="s2">likely get magnified a million times yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:02.039" style="s2">that is why the protocol needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.130" end="00:31:06.929" style="s2">updated in fact we took on an exercise</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.039" end="00:31:09.510" style="s2">called revising the Rio scale so in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.929" end="00:31:11.909" style="s2">Ivan Allen Laura and I gave a paper in</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.510" end="00:31:15.659" style="s2">Rio de Janeiro hence the name Rio scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.909" end="00:31:18.780" style="s2">and we tried to come up with a numerical</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.659" end="00:31:23.870" style="s2">scheme on the order of 0 to 10 like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.780" end="00:31:26.410" style="s2">Richter scale that one could assign a</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.870" end="00:31:30.060" style="s2">potential single detect</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.410" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">so that there would be some easily</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.060" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">remembered way of saying how important</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">this was how impactful this particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:42.430" style="s2">detection was and the zero in that scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:44.950" style="s2">is really important because then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.430" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2">what you give a hoax and there were</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.950" end="00:31:49.540" style="s2">there are many people who enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:52.150" style="s2">publishing the fact that they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.540" end="00:31:55.360" style="s2">detected signals and the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.150" end="00:31:58.150" style="s2">just not there so we did that in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:32:02.290" style="s2">and then just last year we revised it in</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.150" end="00:32:05.410" style="s2">lieu of the media and the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.290" end="00:32:10.690" style="s2">communicate information today and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.410" end="00:32:14.010" style="s2">it&#39;s now a website and you can take a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.690" end="00:32:18.120" style="s2">look at how people are ranking that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.010" end="00:32:22.590" style="s2">putative detection and how the detection</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.120" end="00:32:27.250" style="s2">either becomes more crystallized and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.590" end="00:32:29.800" style="s2">confirmed or fades away because the</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.220" end="00:34:45.490" style="s2">our current level of detection detect</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.070" end="00:34:47.409" style="s2">Earth&#39;s intelligent emissions sadly not</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.490" end="00:34:49.869" style="s2">very far certainly the television</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.409" end="00:34:51.909" style="s2">leakage which people always point to and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.869" end="00:34:55.210" style="s2">say oh the aliens are gonna discover us</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.909" end="00:34:57.190" style="s2">with howdy-doody not so far not even to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.210" end="00:35:01.660" style="s2">the nearest star but if you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.190" end="00:35:04.119" style="s2">our strongest transmitter which is a two</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.660" end="00:35:07.090" style="s2">megawatt radar of the Arecibo</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.119" end="00:35:10.090" style="s2">Observatory so you&#39;ve got two ten to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.090" end="00:35:12.010" style="s2">six power transmissions and a gain of 10</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.090" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">to the seven so you&#39;ve got a few times</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.010" end="00:35:18.220" style="s2">10 to the 13 watts of power in that beam</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">that&#39;s detectable very far sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.220" end="00:35:23.350" style="s2">halfway to the the galaxy center and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:26.910" style="s2">only problem is that beam is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.350" end="00:35:29.050" style="s2">narrow hey it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.910" end="00:35:31.810" style="s2">spherical wave it&#39;s just that tiny</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.050" end="00:35:32.980" style="s2">little cylindrical it&#39;s like a pin</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.810" end="00:35:35.380" style="s2">cushion</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.980" end="00:35:38.260" style="s2">yes so that&#39;s interesting how about is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.380" end="00:35:40.600" style="s2">more powerful than TV a military radar</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.260" end="00:35:44.350" style="s2">or something like that yes you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.600" end="00:35:46.210" style="s2">few a few light-years so truthfully if</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.350" end="00:35:48.130" style="s2">they are out there they haven&#39;t seen us</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.210" end="00:35:50.230" style="s2">unless they have a lot better detectors</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.130" end="00:35:52.270" style="s2">than we do which is of course possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.230" end="00:35:54.610" style="s2">and actually it&#39;s probably probable</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.270" end="00:35:56.440" style="s2">because most of the stars in our</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.610" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">neighborhood in the galaxies are about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.440" end="00:36:02.050" style="s2">billion years older than the Sun so had</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:04.630" style="s2">a head start quite possibly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.050" end="00:36:07.750" style="s2">a technology so we don&#39;t know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.630" end="00:36:11.560" style="s2">kind of two models for technological</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.750" end="00:36:14.850" style="s2">growth one is the sort of s-curve that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.560" end="00:36:17.260" style="s2">we see in all sorts of biological and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.850" end="00:36:19.270" style="s2">engineered systems where you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.260" end="00:36:21.540" style="s2">nothing and then you get an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.270" end="00:36:24.790" style="s2">rise and then you saturate some resource</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.540" end="00:36:26.770" style="s2">so your growth turns over and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.790" end="00:36:28.570" style="s2">other is you have nothing and you start</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.770" end="00:36:31.660" style="s2">an exponential rise and it just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.570" end="00:36:35.560" style="s2">going we don&#39;t know what the future will</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.660" end="00:36:39.130" style="s2">be for technology whether we use up some</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.560" end="00:36:41.830" style="s2">particular resource whether we decide to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.130" end="00:36:44.740" style="s2">turn inwards the way the Chinese did by</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.830" end="00:36:47.230" style="s2">burning their ships on the beaches and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.740" end="00:36:49.090" style="s2">not and ceasing from the exploration</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:52.680" style="s2">that they have been doing we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.090" end="00:36:55.740" style="s2">know but in any case the probability is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.680" end="00:36:59.110" style="s2">highest that you will find that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.740" end="00:37:02.020" style="s2">technology in an old face rather than at</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.110" end="00:37:05.050" style="s2">their early stages so it&#39;s not unwise to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.020" end="00:37:07.330" style="s2">expect some more advanced technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.050" end="00:37:11.640" style="s2">than we have indeed Arthur Clarke had</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.330" end="00:37:13.900" style="s2">three laws the first one when an elderly</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.640" end="00:37:16.360" style="s2">Scientists tells you something is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.900" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">possible he&#39;s almost certainly correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.360" end="00:37:20.830" style="s2">when he tells you something&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">he&#39;s almost certainly incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.830" end="00:37:25.300" style="s2">the second law is the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:27.910" style="s2">understand what&#39;s possible is to push</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.300" end="00:37:30.570" style="s2">beyond into the impossible and the third</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.910" end="00:37:33.750" style="s2">is any sufficiently advanced technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.570" end="00:37:36.070" style="s2">would be indistinguishable from magic</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.750" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2">last one I really like and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.070" end="00:37:40.360" style="s2">again it might be one of the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.650" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">where they&#39;re there but we just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.360" end="00:37:43.570" style="s2">see them because the way they</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:45.550" style="s2">communicate from our perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.570" end="00:37:47.470" style="s2">magical we can&#39;t even imagine maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.550" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">manipulate gravity waves or something</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.470" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:52.900" style="s2">and so there&#39;s been recently a variant</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:55.060" style="s2">of that third law Karl Schroeder of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.900" end="00:37:57.460" style="s2">philosopher environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.060" end="00:37:59.890" style="s2">said that any sufficiently advanced</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.460" end="00:38:01.000" style="s2">technology will be indistinguishable</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.890" end="00:38:02.790" style="s2">from nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.000" end="00:38:05.770" style="s2">there was actually a paper written by</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.790" end="00:38:09.090" style="s2">David Wolper tupple of guys that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.770" end="00:38:11.020" style="s2">indicated that the most efficient</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.090" end="00:38:13.750" style="s2">communication system using</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.020" end="00:38:16.540" style="s2">electromagnetism it was very likely to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.750" end="00:38:19.180" style="s2">look like noise right that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.540" end="00:38:22.150" style="s2">sophisticated and so compressed that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.180" end="00:38:24.430" style="s2">was not a beacon to be found we may well</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.150" end="00:38:26.890" style="s2">mistake it for nature that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.430" end="00:38:30.040" style="s2">and I think a lot of us are excited at</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.890" end="00:38:32.200" style="s2">the moment about putting some neural</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.040" end="00:38:36.850" style="s2">networks into our signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:40.570" style="s2">programs so that instead of us telling</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.850" end="00:38:43.420" style="s2">the machines to look for a particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.570" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">type of signal one that we think is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.420" end="00:38:47.980" style="s2">obviously engineered and the nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:49.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t produce we&#39;re hoping that with</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.980" end="00:38:53.380" style="s2">trained neural networks we can allow the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.840" end="00:38:56.710" style="s2">machine to tell us whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.380" end="00:38:58.690" style="s2">something other than noise in the data</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.710" end="00:39:00.310" style="s2">that would be a very good use of machine</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.690" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">learning I mean machine learning is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.310" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">perfect for that kind of problem where</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:06.850" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for statistical anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:09.340" style="s2">that irrespective of whether humans can</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.850" end="00:39:11.740" style="s2">imagine them or not which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.340" end="00:39:13.510" style="s2">very similar to how a AI is evolving</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.740" end="00:39:15.580" style="s2">that&#39;s an area that I follow very</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.510" end="00:39:17.590" style="s2">closely and you know good old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.580" end="00:39:19.690" style="s2">AI basically a bazillion if-then</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.590" end="00:39:22.600" style="s2">statements that were limited by how</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.690" end="00:39:24.550" style="s2">smart the graduate students were now we</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.600" end="00:39:26.920" style="s2">have machine learning that is able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.550" end="00:39:28.420" style="s2">find things that no infinite army of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.920" end="00:39:31.540" style="s2">graduate students would have ever found</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.420" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">by doing inferences from unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.540" end="00:39:34.870" style="s2">large data sets seems to be a very good</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:36.850" style="s2">fit for the SETI program so I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.870" end="00:39:39.580" style="s2">definitely think that makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.850" end="00:39:41.830" style="s2">sense another science question there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.580" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">been a lot of development the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.830" end="00:39:46.860" style="s2">years around extremophiles forms of life</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:50.410" style="s2">on Earth that have been discovered in</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.860" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">unbelievably hostile environments and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.410" end="00:39:55.080" style="s2">that would seem to speak towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:57.510" style="s2">at least say something about maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.080" end="00:39:58.620" style="s2">range for which life could exist is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.510" end="00:40:01.620" style="s2">wider than we think</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.620" end="00:40:03.870" style="s2">absolutely so over my career the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.620" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">exoplanets and the extremophiles have</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.870" end="00:40:08.430" style="s2">been the two real huge game changers and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:10.290" style="s2">you know we say they live in hostile</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.430" end="00:40:12.780" style="s2">environments but it&#39;s only hostile to us</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.290" end="00:40:15.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve evolved to be fat dumb and happy</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.780" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">in those environments and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.000" end="00:40:20.490" style="s2">surprise to us you know we we have this</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:23.370" style="s2">wrong attitude we talk about the ascent</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.490" end="00:40:26.970" style="s2">of man and we talk about humans being</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.370" end="00:40:29.850" style="s2">the pinnacle of evolution well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:33.380" style="s2">perspective that just isn&#39;t borne out by</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.850" end="00:40:37.860" style="s2">nature we are just one little trick and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.380" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">there is an amazing amazing abundance of</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.460" end="00:41:47.070" style="s2">that&#39;s I would say argued in favor of</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.380" end="00:41:57.080" style="s2">deep than twiddling with the exponents</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.270" end="00:41:59.570" style="s2">so if we still don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.080" end="00:42:02.570" style="s2">next question a lot of your work in</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.570" end="00:42:05.930" style="s2">particular has been around signals but</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.570" end="00:42:08.630" style="s2">there is also other possible ways to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.930" end="00:42:10.760" style="s2">tech savvy or at least past SETI what</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.630" end="00:42:13.460" style="s2">people might call artifacts you know a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.760" end="00:42:15.860" style="s2">member of the stories about tabbies star</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.460" end="00:42:17.900" style="s2">or the possibility of Dyson rings or</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.860" end="00:42:18.860" style="s2">Dyson shells I could tell us a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.900" end="00:42:21.140" style="s2">bit more about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.860" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">well SETI first of all is a misnomer and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.140" end="00:42:27.290" style="s2">always has been because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:29.930" style="s2">how to directly detect intelligence what</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.290" end="00:42:34.310" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is using technology as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.930" end="00:42:36.080" style="s2">proxy and if we find the technology we</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.310" end="00:42:38.210" style="s2">are going to infer the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.080" end="00:42:42.290" style="s2">intelligent technologists at least at</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.210" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">some point in time so we&#39;ve begun using</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.290" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">a term that&#39;s techno signatures it</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:51.140" style="s2">parallels the bio signature work looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:53.930" style="s2">for evidence of any kind of life</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.140" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">microbes we want to look for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.930" end="00:42:58.460" style="s2">mathematicians so we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:43:00.619" style="s2">techno signatures anything that would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.460" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">a change in the environment in a way</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.619" end="00:43:06.890" style="s2">that you could sense over interstellar</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">distances so the Dyson Sphere discussion</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.890" end="00:43:11.690" style="s2">or mega-structure discussion that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.530" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">going on with respect to tabby star is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.690" end="00:43:18.440" style="s2">one such techno signature and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re we&#39;re thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.440" end="00:43:22.609" style="s2">new telescopes that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:26.450" style="s2">coming online in the next decade or so</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.609" end="00:43:29.090" style="s2">for astronomical research and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.450" end="00:43:32.359" style="s2">thinking okay what might those</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.090" end="00:43:34.910" style="s2">telescopes see that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.359" end="00:43:37.400" style="s2">indication of somebody else&#39;s technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.910" end="00:43:42.770" style="s2">so an example that I like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.400" end="00:43:44.710" style="s2">is the Trappist one system this this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.770" end="00:43:47.510" style="s2">a system with at least seven planets</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.710" end="00:43:49.730" style="s2">orbiting a little red dwarf star and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.510" end="00:43:51.800" style="s2">their orbits are so tight that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.730" end="00:43:55.310" style="s2">system would fit within the orbit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.800" end="00:43:57.140" style="s2">mercury around our star but even though</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.310" end="00:43:59.869" style="s2">the orbits are tight they are still at</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.140" end="00:44:02.270" style="s2">different distances from their host star</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.869" end="00:44:05.480" style="s2">and therefore should have different</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.270" end="00:44:07.190" style="s2">equilibrium temperatures but what if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.480" end="00:44:07.680" style="s2">took a look at that system with some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.190" end="00:44:08.849" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:11.400" style="s2">instruments that we&#39;ll have in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.849" end="00:44:14.280" style="s2">future and discovered that three of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.400" end="00:44:16.380" style="s2">were identical even though they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.280" end="00:44:17.910" style="s2">different distances from their star they</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.380" end="00:44:20.280" style="s2">had the same equilibrium temperature</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.910" end="00:44:23.329" style="s2">they had the same kind of chemical</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.280" end="00:44:26.550" style="s2">structures in their atmospheres um to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.329" end="00:44:28.980" style="s2">that would be suggestive of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.550" end="00:44:31.619" style="s2">else&#39;s engineering on a very large scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.980" end="00:44:34.200" style="s2">and so that would be a technical</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.619" end="00:44:36.030" style="s2">signature very clever I like that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">actually and again if you only have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.030" end="00:44:39.960" style="s2">small number of systems you look at well</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:41.819" style="s2">who the hell knows but if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.960" end="00:44:43.260" style="s2">bunch of them and have a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.819" end="00:44:45.050" style="s2">with that signature then you&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.260" end="00:44:47.760" style="s2">to think about maybe we have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.050" end="00:44:50.339" style="s2">high-frequency pattern here on the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.760" end="00:44:53.010" style="s2">hand one of our previous guests on the</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.010" end="00:44:57.750" style="s2">would say a sette pessimist his argument</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.130" end="00:44:59.910" style="s2">was that inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.750" end="00:45:02.790" style="s2">any advanced really advanced</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.910" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">civilization ought to show a giant shift</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.790" end="00:45:07.950" style="s2">of its energy from its star to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:10.200" style="s2">infrared as it starts to use more and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.950" end="00:45:12.299" style="s2">more of its star&#39;s energy and yet he</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.200" end="00:45:16.049" style="s2">argues and I will say he&#39;s an economist</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.299" end="00:45:17.940" style="s2">and a raconteur not a physical scientist</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.049" end="00:45:21.210" style="s2">he claims that we should have already</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.940" end="00:45:23.010" style="s2">seen such large scale red shifts if</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.210" end="00:45:26.700" style="s2">there were a lot of advanced</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.700" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">would you respond to that well indeed</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.940" end="00:45:34.680" style="s2">Jason Wright and his colleagues at Penn</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:36.569" style="s2">State University have done exactly such</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.680" end="00:45:39.589" style="s2">a search right they&#39;ve used the data</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.569" end="00:45:42.869" style="s2">from the wise infrared spacecraft that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.589" end="00:45:46.619" style="s2">surveyed the entire sky and they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.869" end="00:45:50.790" style="s2">looked first of all for technology on a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.619" end="00:45:52.950" style="s2">huge scale so-called Kardashev three</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.790" end="00:45:55.349" style="s2">type civilizations which are able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.950" end="00:45:58.049" style="s2">manipulate the total energy output of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.349" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">their galaxy and they&#39;ve looked for</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.049" end="00:46:02.970" style="s2">these infrared signatures from galaxies</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">that was the easy part of the search</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.970" end="00:46:08.069" style="s2">then now they are looking at stellar</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:11.609" style="s2">sources and looking for infrared</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.069" end="00:46:14.780" style="s2">excesses in stars that&#39;s a lot harder</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.609" end="00:46:17.100" style="s2">because of the confusion limit in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.780" end="00:46:18.630" style="s2">observations but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.100" end="00:46:20.760" style="s2">something that&#39;s been thought of and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.630" end="00:46:22.410" style="s2">fact people are trying to do it glad to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.760" end="00:46:24.810" style="s2">see that they&#39;re Pro bring on all these</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.410" end="00:46:27.000" style="s2">theories and now we&#39;ve kind of talked</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.810" end="00:46:30.600" style="s2">about the past and the theoretical basis</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.000" end="00:46:33.240" style="s2">etc what&#39;s really going on right now one</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.600" end="00:46:35.160" style="s2">of the big efforts in SETI right now I</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.240" end="00:46:37.170" style="s2">know there&#39;s you know the out you have</p>

<p begin="00:46:42.180" end="00:46:45.120" style="s2">telescopes you know tell us about some</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.829" end="00:48:37.869" style="s2">not had the technological capability to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.230" end="00:48:39.720" style="s2">do so so this will be the first truly</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.869" end="00:48:41.800" style="s2">all-sky all the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.720" end="00:48:44.260" style="s2">Observatory for SETI and the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.800" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">cameras have been installed now at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.260" end="00:48:49.150" style="s2">Robert Ferguson Observatory up in Sonoma</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:52.290" style="s2">County the next one will go to Holly</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.150" end="00:48:54.970" style="s2">Aquila in Hawaii then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.290" end="00:48:58.839" style="s2">optical SETI program that is being</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.970" end="00:49:01.960" style="s2">worked on Pano&#39;s NE and the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.839" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">if you remember the buckminster fuller</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.960" end="00:49:06.069" style="s2">domes</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.980" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">well you fill each of those segments on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.069" end="00:49:13.210" style="s2">a dome with a big plastic Rennell lens</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:17.380" style="s2">and then you focus a large piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.210" end="00:49:19.660" style="s2">sky on a small infrared detector so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.380" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">build a telescope that has something</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.660" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">like a hundred and twenty different</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:29.470" style="s2">beams so looks at a number of square</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">degrees I think it&#39;s hmm I don&#39;t have my</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.470" end="00:49:34.990" style="s2">notes in front of me I think it&#39;s 8,000</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">square degrees and does this same sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.990" end="00:49:40.329" style="s2">of observing for flashes and then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:42.819" style="s2">build a second one of these a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.329" end="00:49:45.310" style="s2">away right that&#39;s that&#39;s sounding</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.819" end="00:49:48.369" style="s2">familiar from Project Phoenix so that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.310" end="00:49:50.109" style="s2">you can get confirmation of anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.369" end="00:49:52.569" style="s2">that&#39;s detected I mean you see something</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.109" end="00:49:54.190" style="s2">flash once and well gee what was it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.569" end="00:49:56.560" style="s2">it our instrumentation or was that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.190" end="00:49:58.060" style="s2">something really there but if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.560" end="00:50:01.810" style="s2">second one of these you can get</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.060" end="00:50:04.660" style="s2">confirmation and I&#39;m excited to see that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.810" end="00:50:07.030" style="s2">go forward and then we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.660" end="00:50:09.880" style="s2">gee all of these wonderful new</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.030" end="00:50:10.540" style="s2">telescopes the TMT that will be built</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:15.730" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.540" end="00:50:18.869" style="s2">the LSST the very large optical</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.730" end="00:50:22.030" style="s2">telescope being built by europe and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.869" end="00:50:24.700" style="s2">perhaps in the radio the next-generation</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.030" end="00:50:27.970" style="s2">VLA and the Square Kilometre Array and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.700" end="00:50:31.750" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been thinking about how we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.970" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2">get signal processing in parallel with</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.750" end="00:50:35.530" style="s2">these telescopes how we can use them to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.760" end="00:50:36.980" style="s2">do SETI at the same time that radio</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.530" end="00:50:39.320" style="s2">astronomy is being done</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.980" end="00:50:41.780" style="s2">and so something is happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.320" end="00:50:46.210" style="s2">at the Very Large Array the radio</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.780" end="00:50:50.690" style="s2">telescope in the southwest and we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.210" end="00:50:54.590" style="s2">essentially building a spigot that can</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.690" end="00:50:57.530" style="s2">take data being observed by anyone for</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.590" end="00:51:00.530" style="s2">any purposes and that spigot makes the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.530" end="00:51:02.150" style="s2">data available to SETI detectors so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.530" end="00:51:05.090" style="s2">breakthrough team will be building a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.150" end="00:51:06.590" style="s2">back-end to swallow data from that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.090" end="00:51:08.930" style="s2">spigot so they can be on the air</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.590" end="00:51:11.720" style="s2">essentially all the time and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.930" end="00:51:15.500" style="s2">back to the first project I ever did</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.720" end="00:51:17.960" style="s2">with Stu Boyer serendipity which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.500" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">saying we can&#39;t decide where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.960" end="00:51:22.369" style="s2">telescope is going to point or what</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:24.260" style="s2">frequency it&#39;s going to observe at but</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.369" end="00:51:27.530" style="s2">it will give us a whole lot of time on</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.260" end="00:51:30.530" style="s2">the sky and you know that some level we</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.530" end="00:51:33.650" style="s2">don&#39;t really know where to look anyway</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.530" end="00:51:35.660" style="s2">so we might as well just look where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.650" end="00:51:38.570" style="s2">astronomers are looking and so this</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.660" end="00:51:40.970" style="s2">back-end device for the VLA should be up</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.570" end="00:51:43.460" style="s2">and running in a year or two and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.970" end="00:51:45.500" style="s2">gonna be an exciting opportunity because</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.460" end="00:51:47.390" style="s2">that&#39;s a very large telescope and of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.500" end="00:51:49.400" style="s2">course you have Moore&#39;s law working for</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.390" end="00:51:52.340" style="s2">us now back when your PD PAP would have</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.400" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">had no hope to process all that data but</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.340" end="00:51:56.990" style="s2">today with many generations of Moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:59.000" style="s2">law increasing the amount of transistors</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.990" end="00:52:03.170" style="s2">and driving the costs down</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.000" end="00:52:05.600" style="s2">we have almost ubiquitous computer</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.170" end="00:52:08.090" style="s2">processing to do things like machine</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.600" end="00:52:08.869" style="s2">learning on all this data yes thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.090" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">guard anymore</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.869" end="00:52:13.340" style="s2">absolutely okay let&#39;s move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:14.990" style="s2">next topic and this is where we get into</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.340" end="00:52:18.050" style="s2">some controversy</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.990" end="00:52:20.090" style="s2">Meddy the idea that perhaps while we</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.050" end="00:52:24.820" style="s2">continue to listen we ought to step up</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.090" end="00:52:28.340" style="s2">and broadcast in fact my next guest on</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.820" end="00:52:30.859" style="s2">the gym rat show David Brin has very</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.340" end="00:52:32.330" style="s2">strong views about Medi I wonder what</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.859" end="00:52:33.740" style="s2">your thoughts are on whether we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.330" end="00:52:34.940" style="s2">be in the for you know first tell the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.740" end="00:52:37.670" style="s2">audience what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.940" end="00:52:39.470" style="s2">broadcasting versus listening and if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.670" end="00:52:42.920" style="s2">have views on whether that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.470" end="00:52:46.220" style="s2">or not well I do there are a little less</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.920" end="00:52:47.600" style="s2">extreme than than David&#39;s but Medi is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.220" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">this idea of mess</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.600" end="00:52:51.470" style="s2">jeanny extraterrestrial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:53.180" style="s2">that if everybody is listening and no</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.470" end="00:52:55.430" style="s2">one is transmitting that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.180" end="00:52:57.740" style="s2">work so we should step up to the plate</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.430" end="00:52:59.270" style="s2">and transmit to allow other advanced</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.740" end="00:53:01.790" style="s2">civilizations to know that we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.270" end="00:53:05.660" style="s2">and interested in community and my</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.790" end="00:53:08.390" style="s2">problem with that is that we barely</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.660" end="00:53:11.480" style="s2">managed as a species to get through two</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.390" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">year plans very occasionally we get</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.480" end="00:53:17.330" style="s2">through a five-year plan intact but</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:19.340" style="s2">we&#39;re not set up to tackle ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.330" end="00:53:21.260" style="s2">year plans and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.340" end="00:53:22.130" style="s2">transmitting is if it&#39;s going to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.260" end="00:53:25.370" style="s2">any difference</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.130" end="00:53:27.740" style="s2">you have to start and not stop because</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.370" end="00:53:29.660" style="s2">if you transmit for five minutes your</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.740" end="00:53:33.470" style="s2">signals gonna go whipping by your target</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.660" end="00:53:36.140" style="s2">in five minutes and they would have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.470" end="00:53:38.570" style="s2">be looking at you exactly the right time</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.140" end="00:53:41.210" style="s2">with exactly the right tools to catch</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.570" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">that signal and then they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.210" end="00:53:47.510" style="s2">a little bit wary about whether that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:50.120" style="s2">shot was really something or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.510" end="00:53:54.140" style="s2">they can&#39;t explain and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.120" end="00:53:56.270" style="s2">transmitting is a long-term project and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.140" end="00:53:58.510" style="s2">we&#39;re just not grown-up enough yet as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.270" end="00:54:01.220" style="s2">technological civilization to do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.510" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">when we are I think we ought to take on</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.220" end="00:54:06.980" style="s2">the role of transmitting I I often think</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:10.210" style="s2">that perhaps and again it&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.980" end="00:54:12.710" style="s2">thoughts perhaps the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.210" end="00:54:16.370" style="s2">intelligent technological civilization</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.710" end="00:54:19.160" style="s2">ages is bimodal there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.370" end="00:54:22.370" style="s2">technical civilizations that pop up and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.160" end="00:54:25.220" style="s2">don&#39;t manage to last very long but there</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.370" end="00:54:29.330" style="s2">are some that do make it through any</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.220" end="00:54:33.140" style="s2">kind of a filter to on an old age and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.330" end="00:54:34.990" style="s2">wonder if transmissions the detection of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.140" end="00:54:37.790" style="s2">a transmission from another</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.990" end="00:54:41.270" style="s2">technological civilization it might not</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.790" end="00:54:43.430" style="s2">be the distinguishing characteristic</p>

<p begin="00:54:43.430" end="00:54:48.020" style="s2">the very young and make it to be an old</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.740" end="00:54:51.650" style="s2">civilization so I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.020" end="00:54:54.020" style="s2">potentially as we become old and stable</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.650" end="00:54:56.750" style="s2">there might be an onus on us to help</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.020" end="00:54:59.710" style="s2">others get there too although we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.750" end="00:55:02.930" style="s2">be a very long way from old ores</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.710" end="00:55:05.000" style="s2">truthfully the modern world&#39;s only 400</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.930" end="00:55:08.510" style="s2">years old and I put the start of</p>

<p begin="00:55:16.220" end="00:55:20.600" style="s2">think at this stage in our development</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.170" end="00:55:22.310" style="s2">we do the easier thing first which is</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.890" end="00:55:44.990" style="s2">it worries us because we think they</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.990" end="00:55:50.510" style="s2">us for lunch right but think about it if</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:15.450" style="s2">agreed and we probably don&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.430" end="00:57:18.300" style="s2">to offer them except our uniqueness as a</p>

<p begin="00:58:15.000" end="00:58:22.520" style="s2">opinion and again it is an opinion and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.120" end="00:58:25.260" style="s2">concur with Jason&#39;s numbers is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.520" end="00:58:27.260" style="s2">fundamentalist religion there is an</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.660" end="00:59:37.519" style="s2">we&#39;re now talking again about the</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.529" end="00:59:55.400" style="s2">even think about this right if I were</p>

<p begin="01:00:02.869" end="01:00:09.529" style="s2">and say that you wouldn&#39;t allocate huge</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.619" end="01:00:13.369" style="s2">amounts of money you would allocate</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.529" end="01:00:15.739" style="s2">money in a way that is continuous into</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.799" end="01:00:34.150" style="s2">communication so we ought to fund this</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.609" end="01:00:57.769" style="s2">time well not only is this a bit off the</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.030" end="01:02:38.560" style="s2">for the Pentagon we could have a program</p>

<p begin="01:02:43.390" end="01:02:48.280" style="s2">confronts this is just driving me mad</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.940" end="01:02:49.900" style="s2">that this is not happening so maybe our</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.280" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">audience can help make this happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.900" end="01:02:55.480" style="s2">I love to be next year and the year</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:57.250" style="s2">after that and the year after that etc</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.480" end="01:02:59.710" style="s2">make it a long-term commitment 100 year</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.250" end="01:03:00.760" style="s2">commitment right I&#39;ve seen in some of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.710" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">the things I research that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.760" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">proposed thinking about that way you</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:08.390" style="s2">know over a hundred years we could look</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:09.950" style="s2">X light-years out why number of stars</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.390" end="01:03:12.640" style="s2">and then now we can have these other</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.950" end="01:03:16.490" style="s2">technologies you know laser SETI vs.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:18.140" style="s2">artifact looking versus you know radio</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.490" end="01:03:22.549" style="s2">frequency listening and one could you</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.140" end="01:03:24.440" style="s2">know essentially build a series of of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.549" end="01:03:26.869" style="s2">cells and fill them out over a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.440" end="01:03:28.130" style="s2">years right and at that point we can say</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.869" end="01:03:29.839" style="s2">alright this is what we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.130" end="01:03:32.569" style="s2">here&#39;s our Bayesian here&#39;s our new</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.839" end="01:03:34.730" style="s2">Bayesian right here&#39;s our prior here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.569" end="01:03:36.769" style="s2">what we found what do we think now based</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.730" end="01:03:38.740" style="s2">on a hundred years or the research and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.769" end="01:03:40.579" style="s2">again a hundred years is nothing in</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.740" end="01:03:41.960" style="s2">astronomical time it would take us a</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.579" end="01:03:44.299" style="s2">hundred thousand years it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.960" end="01:03:46.760" style="s2">search worth doing it seems to me oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.299" end="01:03:48.470" style="s2">in I agree with you I&#39;m a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.760" end="01:03:51.049" style="s2">a nut on this this is why we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.470" end="01:03:53.420" style="s2">about the Fermi paradox and SETI and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.049" end="01:03:54.740" style="s2">half of my episodes I just think this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.420" end="01:03:58.220" style="s2">one of the most important things out</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.740" end="01:04:00.309" style="s2">there so my final question which is your</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.220" end="01:04:03.140" style="s2">bottom line after being the leading</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.309" end="01:04:05.779" style="s2">researcher in the world on this field</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.140" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">for most of your adult life I would ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.779" end="01:04:10.670" style="s2">you to give me your best guess and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:12.349" style="s2">underlined guess this is not binding we</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.670" end="01:04:14.359" style="s2">know we don&#39;t know the answer what do</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.349" end="01:04:16.940" style="s2">you think about intelligent life in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.359" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">universe I&#39;m not gonna answer your</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.940" end="01:04:22.339" style="s2">question Jim because I don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:25.460" style="s2">answer I think we can get an answer but</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.339" end="01:04:27.980" style="s2">doing this experiments right if I told</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.460" end="01:04:29.990" style="s2">you anything it would be religion and</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.980" end="01:04:32.299" style="s2">not science right let&#39;s let&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.990" end="01:04:35.480" style="s2">do the exploration I think I spent my</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.299" end="01:04:39.230" style="s2">entire career trying to convert the verb</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.480" end="01:04:41.690" style="s2">to believe into the verb to explore I</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.230" end="01:04:43.250" style="s2">think that&#39;s the proper thing to do you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.690" end="01:04:44.990" style="s2">are absolutely right I&#39;m almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.250" end="01:04:47.599" style="s2">embarrassed from for asking you that</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.990" end="01:04:49.849" style="s2">question cuz you just gave me the answer</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.599" end="01:04:52.369" style="s2">I should have known before I even asked</p>
