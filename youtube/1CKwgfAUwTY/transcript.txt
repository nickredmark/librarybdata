So we can't impose enlightened behavior.It's an oxymoron. We can help to elicit
it, help to foster and engender it. And sowhen we look at the range of human
behavior from the most creative,self-directed, altruistic, positive kind
of behavior, to the most violent orimpulse or destructive behavior, and then
we look at what kinds of influencespredispose each of those kinds of
behavior? What kind of world would weneed to put in place where stewards of
the cosmos were the natural emergentbyproduct of that system? And how do we
help bring that about where then itbecomes self propagating?
