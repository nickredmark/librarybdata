<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">cultivation of leadership and that is</p>

<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">on this morning but there are these</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.310" end="00:00:22.949" style="s2">trade-offs in society between having a</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:25.109" style="s2">central leader that you can release some</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.949" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">amount of authority to leave it up to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.109" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">them to solve this leave it up to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">them to tell me the path to follow</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">and it comes at a cost because the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:38.420" style="s2">community that&#39;s created around that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">falls apart when they fall apart and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.420" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not empowering us each of us should</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">being part of society and realizing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:09.570" style="s2">cost that plays when we need there to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">celebrities and there might always be</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">celebrities but I hope not there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">difference I think between being the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">best singer having just the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">vocal range where you show up and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:29.820" style="s2">being someone who has to be an archetype</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:32.520" style="s2">of the best singer therefore has to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.820" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">the perfect outfit the perfect life the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.520" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">perfect and it&#39;s like that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">look up to because that doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">and the celebrity isn&#39;t getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">out of it they&#39;re getting money and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">they&#39;re getting influence but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">not getting love in connection in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">it&#39;s costing them love and connection</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">real love because even if we think we</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">know a celebrity and we love them we get</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">the oxytocin we get the payoff they</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">don&#39;t they get this admiration of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">brand that they know they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">only way they could know that this love</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">is actually theirs is to be themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">and even then they&#39;re not the ones</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:14.920" style="s2">feeling the love</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.150" end="00:02:16.659" style="s2">they&#39;re getting love and although</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.920" end="00:02:18.280" style="s2">although society is set up around</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.659" end="00:02:23.560" style="s2">getting love instead of giving the love</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.280" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">the payoff comes and giving the love the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.560" end="00:02:27.299" style="s2">love hormone courses through your body</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">when you love not when you&#39;re loved</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.299" end="00:02:31.989" style="s2">there&#39;s also great feelings when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:34.540" style="s2">loved and accepted and seen but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.989" end="00:02:35.980" style="s2">can&#39;t get those when you&#39;re hiding huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.540" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">chunks of yourself because then you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.980" end="00:02:38.709" style="s2">you&#39;re like well if they knew this about</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:44.950" style="s2">me they wouldn&#39;t feel they wouldn&#39;t love</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.709" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">me we can create community create</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.950" end="00:02:52.540" style="s2">connections that are resilient but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">means we have to as individuals own this</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.540" end="00:02:57.640" style="s2"> in ourselves that we want a leader</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:03:00.280" style="s2">we want outside mentors to look up to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.640" end="00:03:01.989" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that but</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.280" end="00:03:04.599" style="s2">when we need them to be a mentor in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.989" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">every area of our life so I need my</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.599" end="00:03:08.230" style="s2">relationship mentor to have their</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:09.819" style="s2">finances their health their everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.230" end="00:03:11.109" style="s2">in order any by finance wanting to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.819" end="00:03:14.019" style="s2">their relationships and health in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.109" end="00:03:16.659" style="s2">as well we need to be able to allow</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.019" end="00:03:19.569" style="s2">people to be real nobody&#39;s good in every</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.659" end="00:03:21.940" style="s2">area I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s good in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.569" end="00:03:25.269" style="s2">every area and so they&#39;d have to fake in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.940" end="00:03:29.530" style="s2">some of them and that faking it costs</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.269" end="00:03:31.389" style="s2">the fans and the celebrity and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.530" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">celebrity and fans very loosely it can</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.389" end="00:03:37.180" style="s2">be anything any influencer I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:38.980" style="s2">YouTube burnout and influence or burnout</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.180" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">and unfortunately when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.980" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">celebrity you can take yourself out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">limelight it a bit but you&#39;re still good</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:45.730" style="s2">luck with Brad Pitt taking himself out</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:46.569" style="s2">of the I&#39;m sure limelight everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.730" end="00:03:48.699" style="s2">gonna know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.569" end="00:03:50.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no choice two below right so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.699" end="00:03:51.669" style="s2">can go through burnout luckily have</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.530" end="00:03:58.329" style="s2">millions of dollars to help you through</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.669" end="00:04:02.199" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the same because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.329" end="00:04:04.750" style="s2">just get unanimity back and a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.199" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2">anonymity costs you your life is put</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.750" end="00:04:08.919" style="s2">under a microscope and you&#39;re expected</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:11.199" style="s2">to be perfect in every area we do this</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.919" end="00:04:13.239" style="s2">to each other too but when you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.199" end="00:04:14.590" style="s2">10,000 people doing it to you versus two</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.239" end="00:04:17.849" style="s2">people doing it to you it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.590" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">different feeling and so the celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.849" end="00:04:23.140" style="s2">simultaneously I imagine it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">the love that&#39;s thrown on them is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.140" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">deserve because you don&#39;t know who I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">and yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:32.340" style="s2">the hate that is thrown on you for these</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:36.300" style="s2">little fractures in your persona you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.340" end="00:04:37.920" style="s2">feel because you haven&#39;t done your work</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.300" end="00:04:40.350" style="s2">you haven&#39;t like made the shield</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.920" end="00:04:46.860" style="s2">actually there to be like right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.350" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">your not my I just think</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.860" end="00:04:53.100" style="s2">policies is empowering me because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.870" end="00:04:55.110" style="s2">before this realisation before this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.100" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">stuff came to light I was looking at him</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.110" end="00:04:58.919" style="s2">like a mentor and I didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">that till he fell from grace like I knew</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.919" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">that I was reading his stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">watching some of his videos and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">would come out and listening to him more</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:10.980" style="s2">than I would listen to a random person I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know I was still seeing if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.980" end="00:05:14.730" style="s2">resonates with me so I was still I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:16.500" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like taking it as the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.730" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">truth or something it&#39;s the gospel truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.500" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">I was but there was still like he knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.490" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">how to live authentically more so than I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:28.140" style="s2">did so I could find out from him in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">area how to live and now I know actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.140" end="00:05:37.380" style="s2">no because to be somebody who makes a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:40.229" style="s2">living off of authenticity and then not</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.380" end="00:05:46.370" style="s2">show up authentically costs must have</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.229" end="00:05:46.370" style="s2">cost a lot a lot of energy a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.260" end="00:05:52.760" style="s2">love for yourself and sit out the stuff</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.760" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">community can heal but but collectively</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.340" end="00:06:01.490" style="s2">together humanity has to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:02.840" style="s2">to get done without leaving it up</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.490" end="00:06:04.700" style="s2">to a central authority without leading</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.840" end="00:06:06.500" style="s2">up to leadership and I believe a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.700" end="00:06:07.430" style="s2">huge piece of that is individually in</p>
