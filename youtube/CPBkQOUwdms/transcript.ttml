<p begin="00:00:03.149" end="00:00:08.040" style="s2">one of us could could do right so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.629" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">idea isn&#39;t to bring your already made</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.040" end="00:00:12.450" style="s2">ideas into it and then say this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:14.190" style="s2">way we do it it still allows something</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.450" end="00:00:16.260" style="s2">new to emerge from the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">itself including who you are what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.260" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">bring to it so if anybody would like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.710" style="s2">start and share what you think is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">currently happening in the social media</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">play space what you like and what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:30.929" style="s2">don&#39;t like and I&#39;m always willing to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:35.070" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.929" end="00:00:37.219" style="s2">no nonsense about just please go all</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.070" end="00:00:37.219" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.879" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">virtual media I didn&#39;t make notes</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">because this is like it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">like fish and water like this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">think a lot of the power lies and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:51.149" style="s2">didn&#39;t even occur to me with the social</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">but the media right to break it off and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.149" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">it was like entertainment and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:58.460" style="s2">information allow you up in one second</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">Eric and it was it&#39;s but social media is</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.460" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">that it&#39;s where we get our information</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">now and it&#39;s where we get our</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">entertainment and it&#39;s where people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">and so any social media has to have that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">people by definition it has to have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">certain number of people that you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:15.080" style="s2">interact with it you know and don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">and at the same time it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.080" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">information and that we get information</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:22.200" style="s2">it&#39;s trustworthy and that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">not happening and we don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">Facebook or Twitter to be the ones to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">put those things into place so we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">like third parties to create things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">how do we trust those third parties we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">have people there&#39;s the informations</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">become echo chambers the entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">has become addiction as opposed to do I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">enjoy this right as an individual am i</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">enjoying being here or is it causing me</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">stress and anxiety is it taking away</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">from my life or is it adding into my</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">life and then of course it&#39;s a society</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">exponentially what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:52.439" style="s2">and information same it&#39;s like I can go</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">down my own a curb chambers and have</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.439" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">things proven to me but what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">to have one place to go it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">actually understand and see the black</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">and white as well as the grey and that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">will I will stop sharing I just muted if</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">anyone wants to go to raise their hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:06.270" style="s2">and we can unmute just because it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">with the background noise and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.270" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">open it up for discussion at the end who</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">would like to go next welcome Eric</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.069" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">all right oh I was actually just waiting</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.780" end="00:02:20.320" style="s2">hello but I&#39;m happy to go next that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:24.110" style="s2">fine that&#39;s fine too</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.320" end="00:02:27.220" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.110" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">yeah so I guess for me the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.220" end="00:02:33.290" style="s2">social media as it currently stands is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:35.959" style="s2">that it&#39;s a commercial operation and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.290" end="00:02:37.340" style="s2">mean a lot of you just mentioned a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.959" end="00:02:42.019" style="s2">of the problems that that brings with it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.340" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">and the echo chamber thing but work for</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.019" end="00:02:48.769" style="s2">me the worst thing is that it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:51.049" style="s2">social media platforms interest to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.769" end="00:02:52.519" style="s2">people pissed off at each other right</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.049" end="00:02:54.079" style="s2">because then they get into heated</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.519" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">arguments and they stay on the site for</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.079" end="00:02:58.519" style="s2">ages and ages and ages you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:02.329" style="s2">there is there is actually incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.519" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">create agitation among people so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.329" end="00:03:08.510" style="s2">the things which are incentivized under</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">a commercial model are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.510" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">profoundly destructive to society I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an Indian guy a comment what his</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:17.319" style="s2">name is he used to be one of the senior</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">engineers at Facebook he helped design</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.319" end="00:03:21.889" style="s2">the earlier versions of the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:26.019" style="s2">and he&#39;s been going around doing talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.889" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">about how it was designed to create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.019" end="00:03:30.889" style="s2">dopamine fueled social validation</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">feedback loop system right where people</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.889" end="00:03:34.730" style="s2">go on social media in order to get likes</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:36.739" style="s2">in order to get views in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.730" end="00:03:38.090" style="s2">comments and that every time they get</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.739" end="00:03:40.129" style="s2">one of these things they get a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.090" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">kick of dopamine in their in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.129" end="00:03:43.699" style="s2">reward system and this is profound you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.959" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">know really really really addictive</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.699" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">stuff and it&#39;s in our biology no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:50.449" style="s2">no escaping from this and so it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:52.519" style="s2">me that I mean I know Jubilee you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.449" end="00:03:54.019" style="s2">to rebuild new social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.519" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">from the ground up and there should</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.019" end="00:03:56.599" style="s2">absolutely be going on and there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:03:58.579" style="s2">various people I know who are involved</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.599" end="00:04:03.500" style="s2">in trying to put these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.579" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">together but I would also like to and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.500" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:09.109" style="s2">saying is in addition to there I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">it will be worth focusing on the notion</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.109" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">of trying to repurpose the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:15.470" style="s2">already have right because they already</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:17.389" style="s2">have huge user bases and so if somehow</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.470" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">or another what Jordan was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.389" end="00:04:22.270" style="s2">in his medium post if somehow or another</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:24.919" style="s2">a fiduciary relationship could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.270" end="00:04:27.889" style="s2">created between social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.919" end="00:04:29.330" style="s2">and their users such that the enormous</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.889" end="00:04:31.639" style="s2">amount of information that they gather</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.330" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">about you is to be used only in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.639" end="00:04:35.870" style="s2">best interests right it is only there to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:37.700" style="s2">serve you not to serve their advertising</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.870" end="00:04:39.020" style="s2">revenues and so on and and if that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.700" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">change could be made and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.020" end="00:04:44.029" style="s2">it&#39;s easy but if that change could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:45.770" style="s2">made I mean that that revolutionizes the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.029" end="00:04:48.500" style="s2">whole nature of social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.770" end="00:04:51.020" style="s2">overnight and then censorship is another</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.500" end="00:04:52.460" style="s2">issue but i reaiiy - that I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.020" end="00:04:53.330" style="s2">talked actually I haven&#39;t had my five</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">minutes so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.330" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">about censorship as well there&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:00.590" style="s2">Eric good solution reason we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:03.110" style="s2">five minutes for each of the times just</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.590" end="00:05:05.990" style="s2">oh right so you&#39;re welcome to continue</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">if you want no no no I did the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.990" end="00:05:09.169" style="s2">censorship is just another issue and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:15.129" style="s2">I&#39;ll stop there I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll leave it</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.169" end="00:05:18.110" style="s2">at that yeah go ahead well great thanks</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.129" end="00:05:21.259" style="s2">the guy that you mentioned was shamatha</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.110" end="00:05:22.580" style="s2">poly pitaya who was VP of growth at</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.259" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">Facebook so he was actually the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.580" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">led the team that led the growth efforts</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:33.590" style="s2">from 30 to 800 million users at Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:35.409" style="s2">which is I mean it can be interpreted as</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.590" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">greater sheet achievement but then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.409" end="00:05:39.319" style="s2">think when we talk about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:41.539" style="s2">problem of social media I think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.319" end="00:05:43.610" style="s2">should start with what does it actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.539" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">mean to have social media and to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.610" end="00:05:49.099" style="s2">just the possibility of social media and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:52.789" style="s2">what does it mean for us to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.099" end="00:05:55.669" style="s2">design the social words for billions of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.789" end="00:05:58.759" style="s2">people right and that&#39;s where suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.669" end="00:06:00.259" style="s2">the design question is actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.759" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">profound and really deep philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.259" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">question of if we have this fiduciary</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:07.610" style="s2">responsibility and if we if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:09.529" style="s2">just ourselves and the word and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.610" end="00:06:11.509" style="s2">say yeah we we just designed stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.529" end="00:06:14.060" style="s2">people obviously use it and so they</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.509" end="00:06:17.509" style="s2">obviously like it so if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.060" end="00:06:21.409" style="s2">embrace our fiduciary responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.509" end="00:06:23.750" style="s2">ask what&#39;s actually in the best interest</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.949" end="00:06:38.539" style="s2">thing we could even serve and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.900" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">see okay that&#39;s evolution and that life</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.539" end="00:06:46.009" style="s2">and evolution obviously want us to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:48.199" style="s2">our best to not go extinct and to be</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.690" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">take our fiduciary responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.490" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">seriously and we that is what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">serve because this is what the best</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">cognitive science the best kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.680" end="00:07:09.590" style="s2">situations that you can make adamantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:11.660" style="s2">converge on this that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.590" end="00:07:15.500" style="s2">empower people to make better choices</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.660" end="00:07:19.820" style="s2">that are SS only consider it as possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.500" end="00:07:21.590" style="s2">and so if you want to do this how the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.820" end="00:07:22.370" style="s2">fact that we do this and how the do</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.590" end="00:07:25.370" style="s2">we do this</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.370" end="00:07:27.110" style="s2">in a landscape that is the attention</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.370" end="00:07:29.300" style="s2">economy with the race to the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.110" end="00:07:31.580" style="s2">the brainstem where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.300" end="00:07:33.770" style="s2">basically based on their business model</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.580" end="00:07:35.860" style="s2">and based on the hundreds of billions of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.770" end="00:07:38.090" style="s2">dollars stacked on that business model</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.860" end="00:07:43.190" style="s2">incentivized to extract as much</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.090" end="00:07:54.289" style="s2">attention as possible so yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.190" end="00:07:55.849" style="s2">really weight problem okay um definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.289" end="00:07:58.699" style="s2">hard to talk about this in a short</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.849" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">period of time I would say that yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.699" end="00:08:07.870" style="s2">incentives are off we only have</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:12.530" style="s2">essentially social media platforms that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.870" end="00:08:15.139" style="s2">are not they&#39;re not built in the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.530" end="00:08:19.130" style="s2">interest of the users that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.139" end="00:08:22.580" style="s2">probably the overall thesis statement</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.130" end="00:08:26.030" style="s2">how that get Matt gets manifested is in</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.580" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">you know 18 different ways that get more</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.030" end="00:08:30.650" style="s2">specific but that&#39;s the overall it does</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:33.729" style="s2">get manifested in making it addictive</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.650" end="00:08:37.610" style="s2">gets manifested in from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.729" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">mostly the design stuff there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.610" end="00:08:41.750" style="s2">thing there&#39;s so many things they could</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:43.480" style="s2">do they could add a button that says</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.750" end="00:08:45.890" style="s2">like say you&#39;re talking to someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.480" end="00:08:47.810" style="s2">through comments they could have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.890" end="00:08:51.370" style="s2">button that says let&#39;s create a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.810" end="00:08:55.400" style="s2">like they could do that but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.370" end="00:08:57.650" style="s2">like there are so if you&#39;re a programmer</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.400" end="00:08:59.329" style="s2">there&#39;s the possibilities are endless</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.650" end="00:09:01.880" style="s2">what you could do with these</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.329" end="00:09:04.700" style="s2">interactions but they are not in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.880" end="00:09:07.880" style="s2">incent the incentive is to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.700" end="00:09:12.170" style="s2">users on it as long as possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.880" end="00:09:16.700" style="s2">always going to mess up what&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.170" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2">you obviously it is a tool with great</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.700" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">potential for connecting people the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.150" end="00:09:25.190" style="s2">see it is it doesn&#39;t connect me to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:28.520" style="s2">people I care about the most what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.190" end="00:09:31.520" style="s2">observe is that people are moving to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.520" end="00:09:36.470" style="s2">text messages group text they&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.520" end="00:09:40.100" style="s2">to group telegram what&#39;s that most</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.470" end="00:09:43.130" style="s2">people I know have moved to group text</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.100" end="00:09:45.890" style="s2">messaging or group messaging things</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.130" end="00:09:48.440" style="s2">because social media is a dumpster fire</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.890" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s just not working for connecting</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.440" end="00:09:57.740" style="s2">them and it&#39;s like kind of going back in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:10:03.820" style="s2">time it&#39;s like there&#39;s so much more we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.740" end="00:10:06.830" style="s2">could do but group text isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.820" end="00:10:08.390" style="s2">work the way that it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.830" end="00:10:11.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this awesome tool called the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.390" end="00:10:15.380" style="s2">internet and we&#39;re just we&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.630" end="00:10:17.060" style="s2">at like 40% capacity to what how it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.380" end="00:10:19.400" style="s2">could really connect you to the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.060" end="00:10:24.950" style="s2">that you love and your neighbors and all</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.400" end="00:10:26.810" style="s2">of that do it and then I guess I lastly</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.950" end="00:10:28.760" style="s2">I&#39;d say well so you have the money and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.810" end="00:10:30.350" style="s2">this incentive structures are off you</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.760" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">also have the entertainment problem I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.350" end="00:10:35.270" style="s2">think we&#39;re mixing too many things I</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.940" style="s2">love news I love entertainment and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.270" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">want to be connected with my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.940" end="00:10:45.140" style="s2">family are those supposed to all be done</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:47.390" style="s2">in the same place like I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.140" end="00:10:49.340" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I&#39;m more of a fan of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.390" end="00:10:53.060" style="s2">let&#39;s create something new that does</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.340" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">this specific thing LinkedIn used to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.060" end="00:10:58.700" style="s2">a networking for for business</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:01.520" style="s2">guess what you can share cat videos on</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.700" end="00:11:03.410" style="s2">LinkedIn now and I&#39;ve seen it like if I</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.520" end="00:11:06.380" style="s2">was running LinkedIn I would be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.410" end="00:11:08.030" style="s2">this cute you know let&#39;s keep that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.380" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">entertainment type of stuff somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.030" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">else because we&#39;re trying to be this</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:16.730" style="s2">professional space over here but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:21.020" style="s2">trying to do too many things now you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.730" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">have Facebook marketplace so like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.020" end="00:11:28.520" style="s2">trying to do too many things from my</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:33.380" style="s2">perspective with one platform I guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.520" end="00:11:34.310" style="s2">that&#39;s my rant on the problems thank you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.380" end="00:11:36.740" style="s2">also have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.310" end="00:11:38.840" style="s2">we can kind of open it up for open</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.740" end="00:11:41.570" style="s2">discussion I like what Daniel had to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.840" end="00:11:43.250" style="s2">about the best interest of the user that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.570" end="00:11:44.840" style="s2">brought up for me is like who decides</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.250" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">and what the best interest of users like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.840" end="00:11:50.090" style="s2">right now Twitter LinkedIn Facebook all</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:52.640" style="s2">of them are there for profit which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.090" end="00:11:54.350" style="s2">not a great incentive for seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.640" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">that looks like in the world but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.350" end="00:11:59.810" style="s2">common incentive whereas my idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:01.640" style="s2">what&#39;s best interest for the user versus</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.810" end="00:12:03.470" style="s2">well versus Daniel&#39;s versus Eric&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.640" end="00:12:04.760" style="s2">going to be very different we can argue</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.470" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">about what&#39;s most profitable if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.760" end="00:12:08.600" style="s2">caring about game a but in game B what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:10.339" style="s2">the best interest with it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.600" end="00:12:12.200" style="s2">when are the questions that I&#39;d ask the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.339" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">game be spaces like are you designing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.200" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">for you or are you designing it for them</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:18.860" style="s2">if I need everyone else to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:20.420" style="s2">behaving and they need to act better and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.860" end="00:12:23.900" style="s2">they need to be less entertained and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.420" end="00:12:25.490" style="s2">less attractive dopamine versus I want a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.900" end="00:12:28.070" style="s2">place I can go to for information a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.490" end="00:12:29.900" style="s2">connection and I want to be in control</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.070" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">of my own data and I want other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.900" end="00:12:34.790" style="s2">to have a say in that so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:37.400" style="s2">build something that does have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.790" end="00:12:40.220" style="s2">people and the spaces that was just what</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.400" end="00:12:44.180" style="s2">what is in the best interest of the user</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.220" end="00:12:46.130" style="s2">is what I think I know right but that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.180" end="00:12:47.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t extrapolate necessarily I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.130" end="00:12:49.580" style="s2">that&#39;s what this thing breaks down that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.630" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">everyone starts their own with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.580" end="00:12:54.470" style="s2">of the best interest of the user without</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.150" style="s2">really looking at how can we create this</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.470" end="00:13:00.230" style="s2">from so that it made meets our</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.150" end="00:13:04.450" style="s2">individual needs collectively the Union</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.230" end="00:13:07.820" style="s2">I think you need a way to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.450" end="00:13:11.630" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s just like in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.820" end="00:13:14.420" style="s2">programming they run like different</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.630" end="00:13:15.800" style="s2">models a b c and d on a website you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.420" end="00:13:17.870" style="s2">actually have like four different</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.800" end="00:13:20.390" style="s2">versions and it randomizes what you land</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:47.240" style="s2">experiments and like I still think there</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.660" end="00:13:48.750" style="s2">won&#39;t be one platform for all these</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.240" end="00:13:53.820" style="s2">thing</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.580" end="00:14:10.170" style="s2">doing what it is doing like really well</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.280" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s not doing other things really</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.170" end="00:14:18.960" style="s2">well so I wouldn&#39;t want to like try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:21.270" style="s2">add scientific articles or something to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.960" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">tick tock like now you&#39;re mixing</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.270" end="00:14:27.570" style="s2">different things that I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:30.120" style="s2">need to try to do alright so we are at</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.570" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">the 15-minute mark so now it can very</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.120" end="00:14:33.840" style="s2">easily go into you can still bring your</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:37.140" style="s2">stuff up so how did we do it constantly</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.840" end="00:14:39.030" style="s2">the next piece is what does your version</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.140" end="00:14:41.220" style="s2">of social media look like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.030" end="00:14:43.290" style="s2">need to match it&#39;s like in your perfect</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.360" end="00:14:51.510" style="s2">what does that look like to you can I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.260" end="00:14:53.190" style="s2">just because I think it makes a nice</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.510" end="00:14:57.750" style="s2">introduction from from the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.190" end="00:15:00.120" style="s2">we have so first off I think abt testing</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.750" end="00:15:04.590" style="s2">is it&#39;s really effective at what it does</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.120" end="00:15:07.580" style="s2">but there&#39;s this nice if you take a be</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.590" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">limit to a be testing to its to its max</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.580" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">every website basically ends up being a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:18.270" style="s2">porn site because they&#39;re like inherent</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:20.280" style="s2">in that kind of measurement is is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.270" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">test like maximizing for engagement with</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.280" end="00:15:27.320" style="s2">which leads you down can Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:29.780" style="s2">biology and then the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.320" end="00:15:32.460" style="s2">what&#39;s in our best interest it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.780" end="00:15:35.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a question of values and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.460" end="00:15:39.350" style="s2">like there are some things like if these</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.520" end="00:15:42.450" style="s2">things are good at universally you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:45.630" style="s2">globally creating a mental health</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.450" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">condemning right then there must be some</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.630" end="00:15:51.840" style="s2">things about them that actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">University problematic and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.840" end="00:15:55.290" style="s2">that we can turn these around and can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.350" style="s2">look at okay what is it that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.290" end="00:16:00.100" style="s2">universally beneficial and in our best</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.350" end="00:16:03.130" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.100" end="00:16:04.509" style="s2">so just like and and just saying we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.130" end="00:16:07.029" style="s2">don&#39;t want suffering and we do it we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.509" end="00:16:08.259" style="s2">don&#39;t want addiction for example it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.029" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">pretty good selling point because then</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.259" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">we can say okay if we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:15.220" style="s2">addiction intentionality is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:16.779" style="s2">good antidote to that and so whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.220" end="00:16:19.540" style="s2">is that we want we want the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.779" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">intentionality to to balance that out</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.540" end="00:16:25.269" style="s2">and then I think the third point is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:26.740" style="s2">ultimately the question of values and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.269" end="00:16:31.209" style="s2">the question of what&#39;s our best interest</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.740" end="00:16:33.339" style="s2">is not at this point not only about kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.209" end="00:16:35.470" style="s2">of opinions and what some people feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.339" end="00:16:38.440" style="s2">good about and don&#39;t think I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.470" end="00:16:41.470" style="s2">ultimately in a way it is there&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.440" end="00:16:43.449" style="s2">limit and that happening with this do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.470" end="00:16:47.050" style="s2">manage to change our collective behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.449" end="00:16:50.519" style="s2">to the point that we end up being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.050" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">viable civilization in this efficient</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.519" end="00:16:57.220" style="s2">timeline I&#39;m just gonna invite you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:58.990" style="s2">transform into what you want with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.220" end="00:17:00.519" style="s2">beautiful future you want to create so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.990" end="00:17:02.199" style="s2">like what we&#39;re not creating what do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.519" end="00:17:03.819" style="s2">want it to look like for you or for</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.199" end="00:17:05.620" style="s2">society it doesn&#39;t matter but like what</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.819" end="00:17:07.620" style="s2">do you want it to look like yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.620" end="00:17:14.130" style="s2">what I would based on that what I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.620" end="00:17:19.030" style="s2">love to see is us coming together around</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.130" end="00:17:24.760" style="s2">values that like us finding finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.030" end="00:17:27.400" style="s2">of the green on a set of venues that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.760" end="00:17:29.530" style="s2">agree on our best interest and finding</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.400" end="00:17:31.780" style="s2">ways to make these values and agreement</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.530" end="00:17:34.870" style="s2">with these values as accessible as</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.780" end="00:17:39.370" style="s2">possible because it&#39;s easy for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.870" end="00:17:42.280" style="s2">value mindfulness if we sit well fed in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:44.620" style="s2">warm houses with good internet</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.280" end="00:17:45.789" style="s2">connection and the laptop it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.620" end="00:17:47.669" style="s2">to care about mindfulness when we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.789" end="00:17:51.240" style="s2">hungry don&#39;t really have a house and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.669" end="00:17:55.000" style="s2">striving to get to get water and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.240" end="00:17:58.120" style="s2">making kind of agreeing on values that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.000" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">are good for us all and making that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.120" end="00:18:03.909" style="s2">possible and just building technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:07.690" style="s2">that helps us become capable of meeting</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.909" end="00:18:10.840" style="s2">the supplement of actually deepening our</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.690" end="00:18:12.220" style="s2">like opening our eyes and seeing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.840" end="00:18:13.779" style="s2">going on in the world and deepening our</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.220" end="00:18:15.820" style="s2">care for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.779" end="00:18:17.349" style="s2">increasing our identity increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.820" end="00:18:19.599" style="s2">circles of belonging that we feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.349" end="00:18:21.909" style="s2">connected to making us become citizens</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.599" end="00:18:25.080" style="s2">of the world and and seeing ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.909" end="00:18:27.609" style="s2">that and then helping us make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.080" end="00:18:29.889" style="s2">okay based on all these things going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.609" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">in the world what is it that I can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.889" end="00:18:34.059" style="s2">what is it that like what&#39;s what&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:39.219" style="s2">to contribute here and how can</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.450" end="00:18:53.529" style="s2">thank you well and you also want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.739" end="00:18:56.159" style="s2">share what they&#39;re beautiful version of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.529" end="00:18:58.330" style="s2">social media looks like in the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.159" end="00:18:59.799" style="s2">I&#39;d actually like to pick up on a couple</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.330" end="00:19:01.989" style="s2">of things here because they all feed</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.799" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">into into kind of what I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.989" end="00:19:07.299" style="s2">see it become so this notion of agreeing</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:08.950" style="s2">on values I think is I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.299" end="00:19:13.899" style="s2">mistake as soon as you want everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.950" end="00:19:15.549" style="s2">agree on the same I know we don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.899" end="00:19:19.629" style="s2">am aware I&#39;m getting there I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.549" end="00:19:21.669" style="s2">there and so what I would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.629" end="00:19:24.129" style="s2">rather than agreeing on a particular set</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.669" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">of values is just agreeing in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.129" end="00:19:29.710" style="s2">and in earnest that we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:31.690" style="s2">endeavour to make this about the user</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.710" end="00:19:32.950" style="s2">experience right and and not that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.690" end="00:19:34.869" style="s2">know what is what is in the best</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.950" end="00:19:36.669" style="s2">interest of the user that&#39;s the value</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.869" end="00:19:38.229" style="s2">right what those interests interests are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.669" end="00:19:39.639" style="s2">is a constant state of debate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.229" end="00:19:42.669" style="s2">argument and development right but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.639" end="00:19:44.109" style="s2">that thing that notion of what we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.669" end="00:19:45.879" style="s2">doing is in the best interest of either</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.109" end="00:19:47.859" style="s2">that is held primary right and that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.879" end="00:19:49.299" style="s2">earnestly followed in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.859" end="00:19:50.379" style="s2">as you were saying before DubLi you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.299" end="00:19:52.690" style="s2">argue about what is the most profitable</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.379" end="00:19:54.070" style="s2">model but we all agree that making a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.690" end="00:19:56.169" style="s2">profit is the most important thing in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.070" end="00:19:58.179" style="s2">game a right so in the same way you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.169" end="00:20:00.009" style="s2">argue about what is the what is in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.179" end="00:20:01.479" style="s2">best interest of the user but the point</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.009" end="00:20:02.889" style="s2">of being in the best interest of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.479" end="00:20:05.950" style="s2">user that is something on which we all</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.889" end="00:20:07.599" style="s2">agree right and the other thing I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.950" end="00:20:09.759" style="s2">to pick up on which also feeds in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.599" end="00:20:11.080" style="s2">that Daniel was saying about different</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.279" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">a specific type of idea I&#39;ve I&#39;ve run</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.610" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">this by two different tech development</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:47.380" style="s2">firms and they quoted me about 30,000 to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:54.399" style="s2">40,000 US dollars is what they could</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.380" end="00:21:56.260" style="s2">build it for so in terms of what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.399" end="00:22:00.220" style="s2">be in the best interest of the user I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.260" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">want an extreme amount of like news feed</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.220" end="00:22:07.210" style="s2">control I wouldn&#39;t really call it a news</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:12.970" style="s2">feed so the person has control over what</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.210" end="00:22:17.740" style="s2">they see on their main screen what this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.970" end="00:22:21.279" style="s2">looks like is like even if you open up</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.279" end="00:22:25.240" style="s2">things it&#39;s like playing the lottery you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:27.279" style="s2">don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.240" end="00:22:34.690" style="s2">and in what order so you scroll through</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.279" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">and you occasionally you hit a something</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.690" end="00:22:37.389" style="s2">that you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:40.779" style="s2">see and most of the time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.389" end="00:22:42.370" style="s2">associated with a person that posted</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.779" end="00:22:46.059" style="s2">something we kind of got to scroll</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.370" end="00:22:48.039" style="s2">through three or four different things</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.059" end="00:22:51.549" style="s2">you didn&#39;t really want to see - you hit</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.549" end="00:22:56.350" style="s2">I have no idea why I saw whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.980" end="00:22:59.649" style="s2">heck I saw and what order so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.350" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">be able to put in order on purpose what</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.649" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">I see in what order so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:08.529" style="s2">thing the second thing is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.360" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">emphasis on controlling who sees what so</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.529" end="00:23:13.809" style="s2">I have different groups of friends I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:16.809" style="s2">have work buddies I have my music</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.590" end="00:23:35.940" style="s2">envision is a way so when I am posting</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.440" end="00:23:40.029" style="s2">something then it prompts me to select</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.940" end="00:23:43.690" style="s2">which what is the visibility of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.029" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">post am I do I want this to be seen by</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.690" end="00:23:48.700" style="s2">everyone or basically I have like</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.789" style="s2">checkboxes I want this to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.700" end="00:23:53.049" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna check off family and local for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.789" end="00:23:55.299" style="s2">this one and then I&#39;m gonna do another</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.299" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">for my just my art and festival friends</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.200" end="00:24:04.110" style="s2">now some most platforms don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.529" end="00:24:07.960" style="s2">anything like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.110" end="00:24:10.210" style="s2">Facebook technically does but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.960" end="00:24:11.830" style="s2">buried down in the settings they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.210" end="00:24:16.179" style="s2">making it difficult to do this on</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:17.559" style="s2">purpose from what I can tell so high a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.179" end="00:24:18.970" style="s2">couple minutes left but I want Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.559" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">and me to be able to say what our</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.970" end="00:24:21.580" style="s2">visions are is there anything else you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:25.750" style="s2">want to add to what your vision my</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.580" end="00:24:30.279" style="s2">emphasis on who&#39;s seeing my things</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.750" end="00:24:30.879" style="s2">literally built into how I post thank</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.279" end="00:24:32.950" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.879" end="00:24:34.659" style="s2">Bentley I know you&#39;ve got some thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.950" end="00:24:39.159" style="s2">what would you what would your vision</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.659" end="00:24:42.009" style="s2">look like yeah it sounds quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.159" end="00:24:43.690" style="s2">like what Eric and Daniel have said as</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.009" end="00:24:45.639" style="s2">far as being able to control what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.690" end="00:24:47.390" style="s2">see I think it&#39;d be great to have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.639" end="00:24:50.330" style="s2">marketplace of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.390" end="00:24:52.160" style="s2">different algorithms on what you see and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.330" end="00:24:54.110" style="s2">you can build your own or you can use</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.160" end="00:24:56.990" style="s2">other people some of it AI some of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.110" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">not would be really interesting and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.990" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">really as far as me I don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">I&#39;d call it a social media platform</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:04.850" style="s2">because I figure all my data I need that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:07.490" style="s2">level of control so if someone sends me</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:11.929" style="s2">an email or a text I&#39;d like to see it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.490" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2">that feet so that&#39;s kind of something</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.929" end="00:25:19.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked about in the past the being</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:22.730" style="s2">able to share that you know control who</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.460" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">kind of sees it that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.730" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.450" end="00:25:27.890" style="s2">I have used the Facebook groups to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">that it is very challenging</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:30.980" style="s2">we&#39;re not groups but there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:36.620" style="s2">way to do it in Facebook but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.980" end="00:25:38.210" style="s2">challenging yeah so I don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.620" end="00:25:41.030" style="s2">I&#39;d call it a social media platform I</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.210" end="00:25:45.049" style="s2">think we need to kind of disentangle all</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.030" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">this and have it or we can we can choose</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.049" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">all the information coming in and kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:54.049" style="s2">of how it goes out and not be connected</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.310" end="00:27:40.030" style="s2">the distinction between emails IMS texts</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:12.790" style="s2">way faster so I&#39;m on my platform way</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.190" end="00:29:14.530" style="s2">less in in you know a way less amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.790" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">the time I&#39;m gonna get to what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.530" end="00:29:19.750" style="s2">see right away so I can put my phone</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:25.060" style="s2">down and get on to living that&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.750" end="00:29:27.630" style="s2">vision alright so we&#39;re at the half an</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.060" end="00:29:30.130" style="s2">hour mark so we can transfer on to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.630" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">major portion which is what could we</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:38.710" style="s2">actually create right now with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:40.120" style="s2">people and $100,000 so yeah what could</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.710" end="00:29:42.990" style="s2">we create with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.120" end="00:29:42.990" style="s2">$100,000</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.150" end="00:29:53.050" style="s2">I think starting with kind of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.580" end="00:29:57.040" style="s2">know what it when you say create how far</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.050" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">you want to get maybe I mean so we could</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.040" end="00:30:02.050" style="s2">kind of kind of think what are our</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:04.690" style="s2">shared values like we talked about in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.050" end="00:30:06.460" style="s2">social media platform which it could be</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.690" end="00:30:08.920" style="s2">simply like we just discussed what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.460" end="00:30:10.420" style="s2">that to make what&#39;s best for the end for</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.920" end="00:30:12.520" style="s2">the individual user and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.420" end="00:30:15.610" style="s2">and then start working on some</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.520" end="00:30:17.710" style="s2">requirements I don&#39;t know how far you</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.610" end="00:30:23.260" style="s2">get with that and all with that money in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.710" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">that time yeah I mean I would I&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.260" end="00:30:31.960" style="s2">it&#39;d be nice to create a a central kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:33.880" style="s2">of hub and just start with either email</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:36.460" style="s2">or Facebook or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.880" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">then add on different features and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.460" end="00:30:44.350" style="s2">options as we need so I guess the core</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.980" end="00:30:46.360" style="s2">thing would be making something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.350" end="00:30:49.000" style="s2">reads the existing social media</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.360" end="00:30:52.360" style="s2">platforms or email and stuff and then a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.000" end="00:30:54.130" style="s2">viewer and not even include editing or</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.360" end="00:31:01.080" style="s2">data entry and you could probably do</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.130" end="00:31:01.080" style="s2">that for that level of resource</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.150" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">so sorry Bentley just just just so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.920" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">clear on what he said you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:15.060" style="s2">about an app which is none of the social</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:17.790" style="s2">media platforms but which can tap into</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.060" end="00:31:19.830" style="s2">them and you can select which pages or</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.790" end="00:31:21.420" style="s2">whatever of which platforms you want it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.830" end="00:31:23.790" style="s2">to display so you is that basically what</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.420" end="00:31:29.250" style="s2">you&#39;re suggesting yeah that&#39;s my side</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.790" end="00:31:30.540" style="s2">there&#39;s legal but it&#39;s a start right I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.250" end="00:31:32.100" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not there&#39;s not the thing but</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.540" end="00:31:33.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a but it&#39;s a start it&#39;s a step in</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.100" end="00:31:35.280" style="s2">that direction yeah just that slimming</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.900" end="00:31:37.980" style="s2">down all the that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.280" end="00:31:39.720" style="s2">and and yeah yeah and in that case I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.980" end="00:31:41.280" style="s2">don&#39;t really 10,000 people to be on it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.720" end="00:31:44.070" style="s2">even if you created that happened yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.280" end="00:31:46.050" style="s2">that&#39;s right for you and so that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.070" end="00:31:48.270" style="s2">you know I mean it&#39;s not the Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.050" end="00:31:49.980" style="s2">would like to have 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.270" end="00:31:51.270" style="s2">figure out what are our common let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.980" end="00:31:53.370" style="s2">we did get 10,000 people together we</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.270" end="00:31:56.220" style="s2">found our common top three common values</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.370" end="00:31:57.870" style="s2">created a social media platform just for</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.220" end="00:32:00.030" style="s2">those 10,000 people so that we could</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.870" end="00:32:01.410" style="s2">interact and coordinate so it&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.030" end="00:32:02.910" style="s2">not to keep in touch with your high</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.410" end="00:32:05.940" style="s2">school friends and your extended family</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.910" end="00:32:07.950" style="s2">it&#39;s how can this 10,000 people create</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.940" end="00:32:09.480" style="s2">something that we that we have a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.950" end="00:32:12.060" style="s2">enough threshold with just us that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.480" end="00:32:14.130" style="s2">want to use it and what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.060" end="00:32:15.090" style="s2">like and then if those 10,000 guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.130" end="00:32:16.380" style="s2">some of them aren&#39;t going to be aligned</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.090" end="00:32:17.970" style="s2">with those values and they&#39;re gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.380" end="00:32:19.560" style="s2">away so then we need to find new people</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.970" end="00:32:21.510" style="s2">with those values to record if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.560" end="00:32:22.920" style="s2">started from the value system but</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.510" end="00:32:24.840" style="s2">starting from zooming out to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.920" end="00:32:26.190" style="s2">elephant what do we get on a social</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.840" end="00:32:28.380" style="s2">media platform and how can we get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.190" end="00:32:29.580" style="s2">good without without the bad well we</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.380" end="00:32:31.530" style="s2">first would have to agree on the good</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.580" end="00:32:33.780" style="s2">and the bad or find ways to to negate</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.530" end="00:32:37.260" style="s2">the trade-offs which maybe isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.780" end="00:32:39.090" style="s2">feasible that&#39;s not I think one point</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.260" end="00:32:41.340" style="s2">where this where there could be huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.090" end="00:32:45.170" style="s2">leverage and which also connects to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.340" end="00:32:47.880" style="s2">repurposing the existing platforms is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.170" end="00:32:49.710" style="s2">just connecting what is everything that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.880" end="00:32:52.230" style="s2">we think sucks about social media and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.710" end="00:32:54.630" style="s2">then kind of cataloging that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.230" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">connection to what are the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.630" end="00:32:59.750" style="s2">we are being manipulated here and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:02.550" style="s2">creating something like a behave like</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.750" end="00:33:05.460" style="s2">creating something like an behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.550" end="00:33:08.430" style="s2">design settings page so imagine in</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.460" end="00:33:10.620" style="s2">facebook you could really design your</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.430" end="00:33:13.230" style="s2">own interface you could select that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.620" end="00:33:17.430" style="s2">want to see stopping cues instead of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.230" end="00:33:19.110" style="s2">infinite feat let&#39;s say you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.430" end="00:33:24.810" style="s2">kind of badge notifications together</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.110" end="00:33:27.750" style="s2">let&#39;s say he could group friends and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.810" end="00:33:29.610" style="s2">family stuff and kind of educational</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.750" end="00:33:30.810" style="s2">dated stuff so that you have different</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.610" end="00:33:35.580" style="s2">feeds for the things that you care about</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.810" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">and so really kind of showing an example</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.580" end="00:33:42.660" style="s2">showing by design how it could be better</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:44.130" style="s2">and how once you give people control you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.660" end="00:33:45.750" style="s2">can also give them control over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.130" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">stuff that was currently hijacking them</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.750" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">and how you could turn that off and once</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:53.850" style="s2">that is established and once once people</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">see that that is possible I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.850" end="00:33:59.390" style="s2">could really lead to a shift in how we</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:02.550" style="s2">think about it and to more pressure on</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.390" end="00:34:05.160" style="s2">these companies so we can&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.550" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">Congress out legislating advertisements</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.160" end="00:34:09.149" style="s2">the business model because there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:12.060" style="s2">too much interest stacked on that but we</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.149" end="00:34:15.360" style="s2">could imagine something like a behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.060" end="00:34:17.580" style="s2">design setting page where people could</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.360" end="00:34:19.110" style="s2">really just see all the design</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.580" end="00:34:21.330" style="s2">techniques that I use to measure to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.110" end="00:34:23.610" style="s2">manipulate them and the setting to turn</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.330" end="00:34:26.899" style="s2">them off and that could be mandatory for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.610" end="00:34:29.399" style="s2">all social like for all media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.899" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">above a certain threshold or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.399" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">and I think that would get us a long way</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.150" end="00:34:45.430" style="s2">I I don&#39;t understand how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.940" end="00:34:47.620" style="s2">proposing we turn these things off I</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.430" end="00:34:48.940" style="s2">mean I get that we can make a list of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.620" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">all the things we think that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.940" end="00:34:54.640" style="s2">manipulating us I mean those lists I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:58.510" style="s2">not even sure we have to make it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.640" end="00:35:01.210" style="s2">google it like from my personal</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.510" end="00:35:07.510" style="s2">perspective at this point we&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.210" end="00:35:10.540" style="s2">aware of of the problems I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.510" end="00:35:14.950" style="s2">when it comes to advertising that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.540" end="00:35:18.550" style="s2">part of how you advertise to get people</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.950" end="00:35:22.330" style="s2">to switch to something that&#39;s better for</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.550" end="00:35:25.180" style="s2">them it&#39;s just like advertising you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.330" end="00:35:26.620" style="s2">other things you try to say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.180" end="00:35:30.550" style="s2">problem with what you&#39;re using and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.620" end="00:35:33.910" style="s2">here&#39;s the solution I kind of back off</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.550" end="00:35:36.550" style="s2">from wanting to advertise problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.910" end="00:35:44.250" style="s2">without having the solution ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.550" end="00:35:44.250" style="s2">otherwise that&#39;s just annoying to people</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.990" end="00:35:49.450" style="s2">there&#39;s something about this 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.310" end="00:35:51.220" style="s2">people hundred thousand dollar model</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.450" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">which gets rights because this</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.220" end="00:35:56.110" style="s2">advertising thing the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:57.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve come to expect to be free on</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.110" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">the internet right we don&#39;t want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.460" end="00:36:00.850" style="s2">five bucks a month to access Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:02.470" style="s2">right we want it to be free and so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.850" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">price we pay for that is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.470" end="00:36:07.030" style="s2">manipulation the selling of our data the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:09.070" style="s2">marketizing of our attention and so on</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.030" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">and so you know 10,000 people each</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.070" end="00:36:14.530" style="s2">willing to pay $10 a month say or $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:17.110" style="s2">quarter or whatever into maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.530" end="00:36:18.700" style="s2">that do not I mean and and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.110" end="00:36:19.720" style="s2">pressure for marketing the pressure for</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.700" end="00:36:21.490" style="s2">advertising the pressure for</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.720" end="00:36:24.790" style="s2">manipulating you to be on site is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.490" end="00:36:26.080" style="s2">largely removed because the revenue is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.790" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">there do you not I mean the revenue is</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.080" end="00:36:29.830" style="s2">provided by the users as it should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:32.740" style="s2">really in a marketer in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.830" end="00:36:34.390" style="s2">revenue is required really the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.740" end="00:36:36.850" style="s2">appropriate model is for the users to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.390" end="00:36:38.530" style="s2">provide the revenue not indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.850" end="00:36:41.260" style="s2">through the sale of their attention but</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.530" end="00:36:44.110" style="s2">directly because they value the service</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.260" end="00:36:46.420" style="s2">that the platform provides right sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.110" end="00:36:49.740" style="s2">what I meant by driving was how do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.420" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">advertise your alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.740" end="00:36:53.180" style="s2">that&#39;s what I meant by advertising so</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:55.460" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.180" end="00:36:58.490" style="s2">scribe the problem people have and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.460" end="00:37:00.410" style="s2">you say and here&#39;s the solution to just</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.490" end="00:37:02.630" style="s2">describe the problem over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.410" end="00:37:05.390" style="s2">not offer people the solution is tough I</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.630" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">mean my experience in this so far is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.390" end="00:37:10.490" style="s2">that ten thousand dollars could get</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:13.940" style="s2">something built a alternative platform</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.490" end="00:37:16.670" style="s2">no problem I think if I had ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.940" end="00:37:19.220" style="s2">people to survey like I would find other</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:21.410" style="s2">people probably in that mix someone who</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.220" end="00:37:25.010" style="s2">has experience with advertising someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.410" end="00:37:26.750" style="s2">who has experience with which I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.750" end="00:37:40.490" style="s2">there and a couple other people that</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:43.099" style="s2">want to work towards this are the ten</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.490" end="00:37:44.569" style="s2">thousand people there to serve our goal</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.099" end="00:37:45.740" style="s2">right like we come up with a goal in</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.990" end="00:38:00.109" style="s2">or is it a vision we are creating</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.460" end="00:38:02.390" style="s2">together and I don&#39;t think one&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.109" end="00:38:05.000" style="s2">and one is wrong but one has been tried</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.390" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">umpteen times and it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:09.349" style="s2">take it like part of the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:11.990" style="s2">getting 10,000 people together is we</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.369" end="00:41:13.859" style="s2">to do that and like I need some healthy</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.650" end="00:41:15.750" style="s2">eating plans like is that what we&#39;re is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.859" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">that what social media is for is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.750" end="00:41:21.660" style="s2">that you know what the internet is for</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:23.010" style="s2">that is like tackling a smaller problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.660" end="00:41:26.550" style="s2">instead of a bigger one right you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.010" end="00:41:28.050" style="s2">find a soccer game a soccer team but can</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.550" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">you coordinate that with everything else</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.050" end="00:41:31.170" style="s2">in your life I want to take up a sport I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.790" end="00:41:32.520" style="s2">want to take up in music I want to have</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.170" end="00:41:34.320" style="s2">a book club here&#39;s everything I want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.520" end="00:41:36.630" style="s2">have and it finds your timetable finds</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.320" end="00:41:38.070" style="s2">other people who also do that and makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.630" end="00:41:39.600" style="s2">it for you right like if it doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.070" end="00:41:41.910" style="s2">your life you&#39;re not going to use it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.600" end="00:41:45.090" style="s2">so instead of trying to recreate all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.910" end="00:41:46.290" style="s2">social media we could recreate on social</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.090" end="00:41:48.600" style="s2">media for 10,000 people and it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.290" end="00:41:50.850" style="s2">work but picking a piece of it it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.600" end="00:41:52.320" style="s2">really help impact people&#39;s lives like</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.850" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">there is this woman called Barbara shear</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.320" end="00:41:56.780" style="s2">who has a TED talk where she talks about</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">people and she just died a week ago and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.780" end="00:41:59.490" style="s2">where she talks about a wish in an</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.490" end="00:42:01.950" style="s2">everyone has wishes and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:03.150" style="s2">obstacle and she has people together in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.950" end="00:42:04.260" style="s2">a room and you give the wish and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.150" end="00:42:05.870" style="s2">give the obstacle and someone in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.260" end="00:42:08.460" style="s2">room has a solution for your obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.870" end="00:42:09.960" style="s2">having a social media platform like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.460" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">or you&#39;re like hey I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.960" end="00:42:12.330" style="s2">start an animal rescue group and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:14.010" style="s2">other people just got like are like</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.330" end="00:42:15.870" style="s2">what&#39;s your obstacle I don&#39;t have money</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.010" end="00:42:17.250" style="s2">okay here&#39;s the funding it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.870" end="00:42:18.930" style="s2">you get the fun you no one&#39;s gonna hand</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.250" end="00:42:20.850" style="s2">that to you but if there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.930" end="00:42:24.060" style="s2">platform that was designed for just wish</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.850" end="00:42:25.140" style="s2">obstacle right just that is that enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.060" end="00:42:26.550" style="s2">for people to come on board well if</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.140" end="00:42:27.420" style="s2">you&#39;ve had 10,000 people and asked them</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.550" end="00:42:29.310" style="s2">what are your wishes what are your</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.420" end="00:42:31.350" style="s2">obstacles how do we design that for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.310" end="00:42:32.820" style="s2">yeah and it wouldn&#39;t be barred or she or</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.350" end="00:42:33.810" style="s2">needing to create it and then selling it</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.820" end="00:42:36.530" style="s2">to everyone else and she&#39;d have a much</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.810" end="00:42:38.610" style="s2">bigger chance she has audience like how</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.530" end="00:42:40.290" style="s2">like a piece of it not something to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.610" end="00:42:42.930" style="s2">the thing it&#39;s just like what are little</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.290" end="00:42:45.570" style="s2">things like that that might work or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.930" end="00:42:47.970" style="s2">big bow junctions I feel like what are</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.570" end="00:42:49.380" style="s2">your speaking to something like we we</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.970" end="00:42:52.110" style="s2">have this gap between our actions and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.380" end="00:42:56.970" style="s2">our intentions and we like if I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.110" end="00:42:58.950" style="s2">about my best friend like he could have</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.970" end="00:43:02.330" style="s2">it better he could have a good day but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.950" end="00:43:05.670" style="s2">know that at the end of the day he did</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.330" end="00:43:07.830" style="s2">for example he meditated in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.670" end="00:43:09.720" style="s2">and he practiced piano and he stretched</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.830" end="00:43:13.860" style="s2">it like these are the things that really</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.720" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">matter to him as I know then I then I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.860" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">care about him doing that and I care</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:19.830" style="s2">about the people around me taking good</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:21.990" style="s2">care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.830" end="00:43:23.610" style="s2">because that and I feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.990" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">something about this intention action</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.610" end="00:43:29.670" style="s2">gap that we just all share and where I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:31.230" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s there&#39;s potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.670" end="00:43:32.250" style="s2">lot of power in social media to help us</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.230" end="00:43:37.510" style="s2">overcome that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.250" end="00:43:38.890" style="s2">is that good attitude that looks like in</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.510" end="00:43:40.650" style="s2">particular like with your friends what</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.890" end="00:43:45.970" style="s2">would that look like I&#39;m searching again</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.650" end="00:43:49.260" style="s2">well let&#39;s let&#39;s say you say if you like</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:49.260" style="s2">whatever it is if you want to eat better</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.130" end="00:43:58.210" style="s2">if you want to eat better like what how</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.350" end="00:44:00.550" style="s2">can we make that easier right like how</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.210" end="00:44:02.530" style="s2">can I personally change my behavior such</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.550" end="00:44:05.320" style="s2">that I eat more of the stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.530" end="00:44:09.430" style="s2">actually want to eat not doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.320" end="00:44:11.530" style="s2">so we could and Joe Edelman will use for</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.430" end="00:44:15.310" style="s2">the talks about that in terms of venues</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.530" end="00:44:17.620" style="s2">and like the things we west goals are</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.310" end="00:44:20.440" style="s2">this kind of achievement problem values</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.620" end="00:44:23.470" style="s2">are practice problems and so if I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.440" end="00:44:28.180" style="s2">the value of kind of fresh and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.470" end="00:44:31.090" style="s2">and kind of local food then that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.180" end="00:44:32.890" style="s2">practice problem because that has the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.090" end="00:44:34.840" style="s2">problem of where do I get that food how</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.890" end="00:44:37.900" style="s2">do I make it such that it&#39;s enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.840" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">and so on and so if we both share these</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.900" end="00:44:41.380" style="s2">values and if we share these practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">problems we can try to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.380" end="00:44:45.900" style="s2">practice them together and how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:49.030" style="s2">support each other and doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.900" end="00:44:51.940" style="s2">yeah I feel like that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.030" end="00:44:54.040" style="s2">social media could be even though it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.940" end="00:45:04.090" style="s2">would be far we may potentially probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.040" end="00:45:06.580" style="s2">move from I guess my response to like</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.090" end="00:45:09.070" style="s2">say doing the local food thing or going</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.580" end="00:45:13.030" style="s2">back to the soccer example the way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.070" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">I see it is that because I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.030" end="00:45:19.120" style="s2">good amount of control over who is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:24.420" style="s2">seeing what I&#39;m posting on something</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.120" end="00:45:24.420" style="s2">like Facebook or Instagram or snapchat</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">what would help like I could post hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.970" end="00:45:33.340" style="s2">who wants to do wants to do a soccer</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:35.970" style="s2">team this spring cool but guess what</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.340" end="00:45:38.860" style="s2">it&#39;s basically going to my whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.970" end="00:45:42.910" style="s2">newsfeed and I&#39;ve got my local friends</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.860" end="00:45:45.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve got my my tech geek friends that</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.910" end="00:45:47.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t athletes anyways they might</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.220" end="00:45:50.410" style="s2">like a group I&#39;ve got my friends that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.650" end="00:45:53.650" style="s2">live across the country some people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.410" end="00:45:56.349" style="s2">across the world my point is that if I</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.650" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">post that I&#39;m actually cluttering up</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.349" end="00:46:02.349" style="s2">their own information stream by seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:06.359" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t relative to them so</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.349" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">if I had a way to clump my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.359" end="00:46:12.760" style="s2">geographically I had a local friends</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:15.130" style="s2">group because that information about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.760" end="00:46:17.530" style="s2">local soccer team or farmers market</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.130" end="00:46:21.010" style="s2">thing or whatever is not relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.530" end="00:46:24.520" style="s2">them so I would want to check that box</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.010" end="00:46:26.859" style="s2">only my clothes only my geographic close</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.520" end="00:46:29.050" style="s2">friends should see this and now we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:34.540" style="s2">to tackle because it is so huge and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:43.450" style="s2">just talking about it well like one one</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.260" end="00:49:46.600" style="s2">thing like I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.450" end="00:49:52.230" style="s2">pronounce your name but wealth shared in</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.600" end="00:49:55.480" style="s2">the comments about the Facebook plug-in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.230" end="00:49:57.460" style="s2">for browser plug-in and I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.480" end="00:49:58.990" style="s2">another one similar that different</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.460" end="00:50:01.830" style="s2">feature set by the same sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.990" end="00:50:05.950" style="s2">for manipulates kind of what you see</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.830" end="00:50:09.250" style="s2">this the that plug-in takes off a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.950" end="00:50:13.990" style="s2">the numbers and stuff which some people</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.250" end="00:50:16.690" style="s2">believe has a negative effect on you so</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.990" end="00:50:18.370" style="s2">yeah the other option would be to and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.690" end="00:50:20.130" style="s2">get a group of people together and talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.370" end="00:50:25.150" style="s2">about what features they want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.130" end="00:50:28.180" style="s2">surreptitiously change in the you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.150" end="00:50:31.750" style="s2">and the user interfaces of these systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.180" end="00:50:33.490" style="s2">and then automate that as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.750" end="00:50:35.560" style="s2">turning on and off certain features</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.490" end="00:50:39.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a limit to it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.560" end="00:50:43.900" style="s2">definitely doable I&#39;ve created a few</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.220" end="00:50:46.920" style="s2">small ones just for myself actually yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.900" end="00:50:46.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s another option</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.319" end="00:50:53.880" style="s2">I love those ideas that I also think</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.479" end="00:50:55.259" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s the opposite side from</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.880" end="00:50:57.239" style="s2">what I want to tackle everything with</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.259" end="00:50:58.559" style="s2">but finding tools that work for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.239" end="00:51:00.390" style="s2">individuals where you don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.559" end="00:51:01.559" style="s2">threshold of people then it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.390" end="00:51:02.999" style="s2">matter as long as it doesn&#39;t cost</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.559" end="00:51:05.069" style="s2">thousands of dollars to keep it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.999" end="00:51:06.630" style="s2">business then you know I mean anyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.069" end="00:51:08.489" style="s2">else using it is taken away from</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.630" end="00:51:10.349" style="s2">Facebook but you create tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.489" end="00:51:11.940" style="s2">like Facebook&#39;s not getting your data</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.349" end="00:51:14.369" style="s2">even if you&#39;re on it Facebook isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.940" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">getting like then that would be huge and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.369" end="00:51:18.779" style="s2">then we solved the problem on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.479" style="s2">existing platforms I just don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.779" end="00:51:23.539" style="s2">tech skills to think those things up</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.479" end="00:51:25.829" style="s2">yeah I mean you do need enough people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.539" end="00:51:28.019" style="s2">fund the ongoing maintenance something</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.829" end="00:51:30.420" style="s2">like that will be very fragile every</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.019" end="00:51:33.239" style="s2">time they change the UI or potentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.420" end="00:51:38.759" style="s2">break you don&#39;t necessarily 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.239" end="00:51:46.529" style="s2">people for that but yeah you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.759" end="00:51:48.809" style="s2">like arms race got it right just to kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.529" end="00:51:54.029" style="s2">of the the Metro cater that I shared</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.809" end="00:51:56.699" style="s2">this just one really interesting example</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.029" end="00:52:00.449" style="s2">of like this these numbers are there</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.699" end="00:52:03.779" style="s2">because they work and like this posted</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.449" end="00:52:05.489" style="s2">two minutes ago you may gives us this</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.779" end="00:52:07.229" style="s2">feeling of urgency and it&#39;s like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.489" end="00:52:09.420" style="s2">need to engage with this and keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.229" end="00:52:11.459" style="s2">really engaged and so that&#39;s why these</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.420" end="00:52:14.789" style="s2">numbers are there and that&#39;s why when I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.459" end="00:52:18.509" style="s2">first like its darkest and turn it on</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.789" end="00:52:20.789" style="s2">and I saw what like how different the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.509" end="00:52:23.130" style="s2">experience is when it just says recently</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.789" end="00:52:24.359" style="s2">and and you can realize how many numbers</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.130" end="00:52:28.619" style="s2">there have been before that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.359" end="00:52:32.299" style="s2">even notice and so that&#39;s kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.619" end="00:52:35.099" style="s2">example of what what I meant before with</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.299" end="00:52:36.900" style="s2">yeah just giving people control over the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.099" end="00:52:41.339" style="s2">interface and giving people control to</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.900" end="00:52:44.279" style="s2">turn these kind of designs on and off</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.339" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">and so you like it would be no problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.279" end="00:52:47.880" style="s2">for Facebook to design it in a way so</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:50.369" style="s2">that you can choose if you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.880" end="00:52:53.160" style="s2">the infinite feet or if you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.369" end="00:52:55.829" style="s2">let&#39;s say ten posts and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.160" end="00:53:00.220" style="s2">click a button or if you want to see</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.829" end="00:53:02.530" style="s2">these metrics or not and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.220" end="00:53:05.830" style="s2">from a design and tech perspective</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.530" end="00:53:08.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really doable and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.830" end="00:53:11.260" style="s2">once we do that then it would have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.440" end="00:53:13.090" style="s2">dynamic of people realizing all there</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.260" end="00:53:14.980" style="s2">are these numbers and they really make</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.090" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">me feel different and when they are</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.980" end="00:53:21.570" style="s2">turned off and maybe I feel less anxious</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:21.570" style="s2">and yeah that that could</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.730" end="00:53:37.950" style="s2">just kind of reminds me that there a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.320" end="00:53:40.290" style="s2">of this stuff is experiments from some</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.950" end="00:53:43.170" style="s2">of the stuff that I&#39;ve heard and read</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:45.510" style="s2">about which is inside of something</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.170" end="00:53:48.570" style="s2">called game B and they talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.510" end="00:53:50.670" style="s2">how things are kind of it&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.570" end="00:53:55.740" style="s2">generator function with or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.670" end="00:53:58.350" style="s2">like a evolutionary thing that you set</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.740" end="00:54:00.870" style="s2">in motion and but you kind of you set</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.350" end="00:54:03.240" style="s2">the open niches and you can leave open</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.870" end="00:54:06.870" style="s2">harmful niches for things to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.240" end="00:54:09.360" style="s2">and the more that you know you think</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.870" end="00:54:13.860" style="s2">ahead and guard for possible things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.360" end="00:54:16.590" style="s2">could happen but you&#39;re reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.860" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">chances for harmful things to come out</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.590" end="00:54:22.290" style="s2">of these so yeah I wonder what the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">thought experiment is to say well we put</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.290" end="00:54:26.520" style="s2">that those numbers when someone posted</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:29.820" style="s2">something or we don&#39;t put it and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.520" end="00:54:32.580" style="s2">found a way to turn that off</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.820" end="00:54:34.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard thought experiment to run</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.580" end="00:54:36.390" style="s2">like way down the road what is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.860" end="00:54:40.410" style="s2">gonna how&#39;s this going to make people</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.390" end="00:54:42.870" style="s2">feel but it reminds me that like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.410" end="00:54:44.640" style="s2">how come there isn&#39;t a setting right in</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.870" end="00:54:45.750" style="s2">facebook that lets me turn that on and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.640" end="00:54:47.430" style="s2">off for myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.750" end="00:54:50.730" style="s2">and said someone had to come out from</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.430" end="00:54:52.190" style="s2">the other side but yeah once we set</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.730" end="00:54:55.500" style="s2">these things in motion whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.190" end="00:54:58.200" style="s2">experiment you want to run like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.500" end="00:55:05.280" style="s2">going to do that within the parameters</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.200" end="00:55:07.050" style="s2">that you left open so we&#39;re down to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.280" end="00:55:08.700" style="s2">last few minutes at the very end I like</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.050" end="00:55:10.860" style="s2">to go around and say what you think you</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.700" end="00:55:13.200" style="s2">can add any closing comments as well but</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.860" end="00:55:15.570" style="s2">what do you think is the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.200" end="00:55:17.070" style="s2">thing we could do with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.570" end="00:55:18.390" style="s2">$100,000 that you would want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.070" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">participate in or you would want to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.390" end="00:55:21.870" style="s2">in existence try to keep it somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:26.910" style="s2">succinct because we only have with you a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.870" end="00:55:29.820" style="s2">few minutes left I like the idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.910" end="00:55:32.010" style="s2">having just listened to the last Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.820" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">and Bentley I like the idea of creating</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.010" end="00:55:38.280" style="s2">a like a menu of plugins right so you</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:40.860" style="s2">can modify your experience of Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.280" end="00:55:41.160" style="s2">or whatever other platform and with a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.860" end="00:55:45.869" style="s2">pool</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.160" end="00:55:47.309" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 I think you</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.869" end="00:55:49.109" style="s2">could probably create a decent-sized</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.309" end="00:55:50.490" style="s2">menu of plugins of various different</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.109" end="00:55:51.900" style="s2">kinds of plugins that did various</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.490" end="00:55:54.030" style="s2">differently I made various different</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.900" end="00:55:55.849" style="s2">alterations to your experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.030" end="00:55:58.470" style="s2">platform and and and just have those</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.849" end="00:56:00.089" style="s2">available for people to you I I liked</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.470" end="00:56:01.589" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t know I didn&#39;t know it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.089" end="00:56:03.210" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know it was doable that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.589" end="00:56:05.309" style="s2">could just download a plug-in and modify</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.210" end="00:56:11.609" style="s2">the modify the front-end I think they</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.309" end="00:56:13.319" style="s2">could do that it&#39;s cool yeah it&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.609" end="00:56:14.730" style="s2">in your browser it won&#39;t work in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.319" end="00:56:19.559" style="s2">mobile apps and there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.730" end="00:56:22.289" style="s2">other challenges but it might help yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.559" end="00:56:26.369" style="s2">so I would like to see a community of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.289" end="00:56:28.890" style="s2">people sharing what changes they would</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.369" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">want to social media and then funding</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.890" end="00:56:36.990" style="s2">projects to experiment with that through</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:39.270" style="s2">you know collective action and whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.990" end="00:56:42.180" style="s2">that be the plugins or a brand-new start</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.270" end="00:56:44.940" style="s2">from scratch or this kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.180" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">media reader thing that I suggested and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.940" end="00:56:51.500" style="s2">and Falls of mine with what other people</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:51.500" style="s2">said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.150" end="00:57:02.440" style="s2">about you welcome Daniel I&#39;ve been even</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.610" end="00:57:04.870" style="s2">decided what Eric said I think is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.440" end="00:57:06.670" style="s2">powerful getting a list of the plugins</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.870" end="00:57:08.110" style="s2">that exist and then seen the holes and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.670" end="00:57:10.090" style="s2">what plugins don&#39;t exist that we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.110" end="00:57:12.400" style="s2">create together but personally in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.090" end="00:57:14.350" style="s2">life what I want is something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">drastically impacts my life either helps</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.350" end="00:57:18.070" style="s2">me eat better helps me connect more with</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:20.050" style="s2">people in a way that works for my my</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.070" end="00:57:21.640" style="s2">executive dysfunction like I want</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.050" end="00:57:23.500" style="s2">something that makes life better right</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.640" end="00:57:25.180" style="s2">away they can be that isn&#39;t being done</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.500" end="00:57:26.710" style="s2">right now that isn&#39;t odd like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.180" end="00:57:28.570" style="s2">need to be in game B and wanting to save</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.710" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">the world to be part of this you can see</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.570" end="00:57:31.660" style="s2">how it impacts your life and gives you</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:35.740" style="s2">gives you a benefit and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.660" end="00:57:37.510" style="s2">something in that space but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.740" end="00:57:41.320" style="s2">most powerful thing I can we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.510" end="00:57:44.650" style="s2">is I think what Eric suggested yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.320" end="00:57:47.020" style="s2">think I mean I have no idea how to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.650" end="00:57:52.030" style="s2">that with 10,000 people in thousand</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.020" end="00:57:54.340" style="s2">hours but I think just having something</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.030" end="00:57:57.010" style="s2">that supports me in living by my values</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.340" end="00:57:59.890" style="s2">and that makes it really easy and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.010" end="00:58:01.690" style="s2">attractive to my values and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.890" end="00:58:03.910" style="s2">it possible to practice them together I</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.690" end="00:58:05.770" style="s2">think that would be really important</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.910" end="00:58:08.230" style="s2">because it would kind of change the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.770" end="00:58:10.540" style="s2">social dynamics such that we see each</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.230" end="00:58:13.110" style="s2">other&#39;s values and we see what we care</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.540" end="00:58:15.250" style="s2">about and we can support each other in</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.110" end="00:58:18.300" style="s2">choosing in alignment with that and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.250" end="00:58:18.300" style="s2">living in a land with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.760" end="00:58:26.670" style="s2">I find $100,000 and I already have my</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.090" end="00:58:29.820" style="s2">thing built and running and I be</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.670" end="00:58:31.740" style="s2">inviting people to try it out the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.820" end="00:58:34.200" style="s2">practical thing I liked what Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.740" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">said at first that you could create an</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.200" end="00:58:40.980" style="s2">ecosystem of people who want to continue</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:44.300" style="s2">to work on this problem and people with</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.980" end="00:58:46.980" style="s2">the talent to create little experiments</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.300" end="00:58:50.190" style="s2">people with the talent who could make</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.980" end="00:58:55.470" style="s2">what do you call it just little practice</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.190" end="00:59:00.330" style="s2">versions of things to try that could</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.470" end="00:59:07.500" style="s2">probably be done community of social</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.330" end="00:59:09.210" style="s2">media problem solver experimenters they</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.500" end="00:59:11.580" style="s2">carry on to participating next week</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.210" end="00:59:15.060" style="s2">we&#39;re back for the live solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.580" end="00:59:16.530" style="s2">with the topic of prisons because I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.060" end="00:59:18.180" style="s2">told that we can&#39;t tackle that with</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.530" end="00:59:20.010" style="s2">social solution raising that can only be</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.180" end="00:59:21.840" style="s2">tackled at the government level so</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.010" end="00:59:23.460" style="s2">challenge accepted what can we come up</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.840" end="00:59:24.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve got zero in there like I really</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.460" end="00:59:27.300" style="s2">feel like I don&#39;t know how we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.990" end="00:59:29.670" style="s2">affect prisons with ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.300" end="00:59:32.100" style="s2">under $1,000 but I look forward to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.670" end="00:59:34.970" style="s2">discussion so say goodbye to YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.100" end="00:59:34.970" style="s2">we&#39;ll see you next week</p>
