<p begin="00:00:00.210" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">hello happy Labor Day it is day 16 of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.710" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">videos 100 and today since it&#39;s Labor</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">Day I was going to talk about well labor</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">movement and how we celebrate today due</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:20.699" style="s2">to how hard unions fought to get a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">supporting our work week a two-day</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.699" end="00:00:28.170" style="s2">weekend and a safe work environment and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">to me the next step is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">freeing us from labor altogether to not</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">have to tie our time and labor to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">whether or not we can live so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">not forced to work 40 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:46.890" style="s2">or even 10 hours a week in order to put</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">food on the table and a roof over your</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.890" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">head then what do you do what do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">spend your time doing and my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:59.480" style="s2">maybe not my whole life since I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">about 18 19 so half my life I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.480" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">obsessed that&#39;s wrong word I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">learning and very intrigued with this</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">idea of passive income I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">much I even really agree with it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">to get money from interest and because</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">any money you&#39;re getting from passive</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">incomes from other people can do mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">labor for you and I mean it&#39;s also from</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">your idea I mean there&#39;s other ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">together for sure but this idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">wanted to get passive income so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be tying my time to how much</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">money I had because it loses joy for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">when I get paid for something I want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">not have I want to have time freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">money freedom right now I have time</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">freedom but I definitely don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.229" end="00:01:42.750" style="s2">money freedom because careful what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">wish for</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.750" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">I got passive income in the form of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">disability and disability payments so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">don&#39;t have to work in order to put a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:56.579" style="s2">foot over my head and food on the table</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">and the money I do I can make a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.579" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">bit of money that is extra so and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">working to get off of it altogether</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:05.719" style="s2">because I do know there&#39;s just too many</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:08.719" style="s2">rules and so there isn&#39;t that freedom</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.719" end="00:02:08.719" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.190" end="00:02:15.590" style="s2">since not having to work I&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.440" end="00:02:18.410" style="s2">I&#39;m able to slash had to just sit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.590" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">think and that&#39;s how I&#39;ve come up with</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.410" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">my purpose on this planet how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:26.990" style="s2">discovered the solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:29.720" style="s2">everything the solution everything is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.990" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">what I was able to when given time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.720" end="00:02:35.209" style="s2">space and not having to the stress of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:36.530" style="s2">having to work and what happens if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.209" end="00:02:38.870" style="s2">goes and what happens if your standard</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.530" end="00:02:40.430" style="s2">of living is decreased in and how do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.870" end="00:02:42.380" style="s2">pay my debts and how do i when it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.430" end="00:02:45.380" style="s2">evaporates when the universe takes it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.380" end="00:02:47.900" style="s2">away from you there&#39;s pros and cons but</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.380" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">one of the big pros is having that space</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.900" end="00:02:52.489" style="s2">to find and so for this Labor Day when</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:56.150" style="s2">I&#39;m meditating cuz imma get meditated</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.489" end="00:02:57.020" style="s2">today and I can&#39;t really control what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:02:58.130" style="s2">want to be thinking about I believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.020" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">whatever thoughts are my head but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.130" end="00:03:03.050" style="s2">definitely been thinking about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.470" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">of the labor movement and I mean I read</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:09.800" style="s2">I&#39;m just a different cookie oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know raisin oatmeal cookie in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.800" end="00:03:16.700" style="s2">chocolate chip case or something or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.690" end="00:03:18.590" style="s2">opposite and they you know I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.700" end="00:03:19.700" style="s2">going off there&#39;s my child interrupting</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:23.000" style="s2">which is what happened in the last video</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.700" end="00:03:26.209" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s Labor Day she&#39;s home figuring</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.000" end="00:03:27.769" style="s2">out what to do with your time is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.209" end="00:03:33.049" style="s2">stressful to people when they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.769" end="00:03:35.690" style="s2">to work but when we have everyone with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.049" end="00:03:39.470" style="s2">that freedom to be released from stress</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.690" end="00:03:42.830" style="s2">I do believe that we will have amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.470" end="00:03:47.480" style="s2">art and inventions and systems created</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.830" end="00:03:49.250" style="s2">because although stress can be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.480" end="00:03:52.040" style="s2">motivator it has been up to this point</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.250" end="00:03:54.019" style="s2">in capitalism that not having food on</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.040" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">the table is a great motivator to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.019" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">out there and figure out what to do to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">put it on the table but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.700" end="00:04:01.670" style="s2">it&#39;s our highest purpose I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.580" style="s2">it&#39;s our highest Colleen and even if it</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.670" end="00:04:07.370" style="s2">is even if people are driven by money</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.580" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">and if every if I&#39;m the only person on</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.370" end="00:04:11.630" style="s2">this planet that isn&#39;t driven by money</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">they&#39;re still high like you no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.630" end="00:04:16.820" style="s2">driven by money it&#39;s what money can buy</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:19.060" style="s2">it&#39;s the freedom it&#39;s the materialism</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.820" end="00:04:22.540" style="s2">it&#39;s what it can buy</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.060" end="00:04:24.610" style="s2">and I think we can give people most of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:27.100" style="s2">what they want and all of what they need</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.610" end="00:04:29.200" style="s2">for every person every of the 7 billion</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.100" end="00:04:30.820" style="s2">people on this planet we can do that for</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.200" end="00:04:34.360" style="s2">everyone if we cooperate and come</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.820" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">together and we just need the systems in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.360" end="00:04:37.330" style="s2">place to be able to do that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:40.419" style="s2">easy to say hey there&#39;s like come</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.330" end="00:04:43.660" style="s2">together big hug big hands across the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.419" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">world but unless we there&#39;s a feasible</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.660" end="00:04:47.380" style="s2">way to do that I get that that just</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">sounds like a pipe dream but I have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.380" end="00:04:51.910" style="s2">feasible way of damina and I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">on I finally figure out my outline well</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.910" end="00:04:54.850" style="s2">falling asleep last night I almost got</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">up writing down a way this is simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.850" end="00:04:59.650" style="s2">enough I feel like I can just remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">it it was pretty much like why we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.650" end="00:05:05.320" style="s2">it all of the problems that we we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:07.240" style="s2">in capitalism in society now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.320" end="00:05:08.890" style="s2">need to go there I mean I&#39;ve read dozens</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.240" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">and dozens of books on those subjects so</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.890" end="00:05:12.610" style="s2">like a chapter a few chapters on what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:18.310" style="s2">climate change is doing what poverty is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.610" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">doing then a how the solution that I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.310" end="00:05:22.210" style="s2">so why the global cooperative what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:24.100" style="s2">global cooperative is and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.210" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">section is like how it works and already</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.100" end="00:05:26.770" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it too how it works and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:28.990" style="s2">then what we can do with it it would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.770" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">the final section there might be three</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.990" end="00:05:32.680" style="s2">specific sections but I I liked that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:35.410" style="s2">that idea to float nicely in my brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.680" end="00:05:37.570" style="s2">last night but after five minutes down</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.410" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">it&#39;s Labor Day and I&#39;m gonna go and hang</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.570" end="00:05:42.510" style="s2">out with my kid so happy Labor Day</p>
