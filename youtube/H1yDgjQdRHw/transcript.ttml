<p begin="00:00:14.450" end="00:00:19.500" style="s2">welcome back to awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:22.500" style="s2">meaning crisis so last time we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.500" end="00:00:25.259" style="s2">taking in an in-depth look at the work</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.500" end="00:00:28.079" style="s2">of Stanovich and rationality because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.259" end="00:00:30.919" style="s2">are building towards an account of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.079" end="00:00:34.500" style="s2">wisdom because that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.919" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">intertwined with the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:41.690" style="s2">enlightenment and of course with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">cultivation of meaning we noted that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.690" end="00:00:46.410" style="s2">rationality is an existential issue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">not just a matter of how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.410" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">processing information it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">that is constitutive of our identity in</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">important ways and our mode of being in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:59.190" style="s2">the world and we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:01.910" style="s2">again one of the core things we saw as</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">we took a look at the rationality debate</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.910" end="00:01:08.969" style="s2">in which stand of its work was situated</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">is that debate showed us a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.969" end="00:01:16.100" style="s2">important things it showed us if I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:19.139" style="s2">put this as a formula that right</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.100" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">rationality does not equal logic</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.139" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">allottee and it does not equal</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">intelligence that debate also showed us</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:31.499" style="s2">that we need multiple competencies when</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:34.259" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about rationality we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.499" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">an inferential competency but we need an</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.259" end="00:01:38.819" style="s2">independent competency of control and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:40.859" style="s2">then I propose to you how we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.819" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">understand what that competency is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.859" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">what the normative theory is acting upon</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">it namely insight good problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:54.179" style="s2">formulation we then moved into what</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">standard it saw as the missing piece if</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.179" end="00:01:59.279" style="s2">intelligence doesn&#39;t give us rationality</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">what&#39;s the missing pieces two missing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.279" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">pieces they overlap in some important</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:08.060" style="s2">ways one is the notion he calls it mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:12.440" style="s2">where what I&#39;ve called psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.060" end="00:02:16.920" style="s2">and the other is a cognitive style and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.440" end="00:02:19.380" style="s2">the cognitive style that he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.920" end="00:02:22.380" style="s2">was active open mindedness which he gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.380" end="00:02:25.600" style="s2">from Jonathan Barron and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:29.140" style="s2">idea that what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.600" end="00:02:32.230" style="s2">is cultivate a sensitivity and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.140" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">ongoing awareness of the presence and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.230" end="00:02:37.870" style="s2">effect of cognitive biases in your</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:40.660" style="s2">cognitive behavior your cognitive life</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.870" end="00:02:43.870" style="s2">and to actively counteract them I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.660" end="00:02:45.610" style="s2">pointed out that unlike Stanovich who</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.870" end="00:02:48.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t emphasize this as much Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.610" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">Barron who&#39;s the originator of this idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.610" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">as a constitutive feature of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">points out that you can&#39;t do that too</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:03:00.490" style="s2">much because if you try to override too</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:02.350" style="s2">many of your cognitive biases you of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.490" end="00:03:05.320" style="s2">course will be also overriding them in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.350" end="00:03:07.240" style="s2">their functioning as heuristics that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.320" end="00:03:11.290" style="s2">help you avoid common and toward</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.240" end="00:03:12.910" style="s2">explosions so getting an optimal form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.290" end="00:03:16.230" style="s2">active open mindedness rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.910" end="00:03:21.310" style="s2">maximal form of it is crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:23.710" style="s2">rationality I want to just briefly stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.310" end="00:03:25.960" style="s2">here and be a little bit more precise</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.710" end="00:03:28.540" style="s2">about how I want to use this term I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.960" end="00:03:31.180" style="s2">been using it throughout and I basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.540" end="00:03:33.220" style="s2">defined it by example and then it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.180" end="00:03:34.300" style="s2">through exemplification but I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.220" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">a little bit clearer about it because</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.300" end="00:03:40.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be relevant as we go</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:43.060" style="s2">forward and talk about wisdom so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.600" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">the definition I want to offer to try</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.060" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">and clarify what I mean and how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:51.520" style="s2">using the term psycho technology as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.510" end="00:03:54.490" style="s2">said I don&#39;t claim to be the originator</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.520" end="00:03:57.550" style="s2">of this idea but I am claiming that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.490" end="00:04:00.130" style="s2">is the particular slant I&#39;m taking on</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.550" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">this idea of psycho technology the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.130" end="00:04:04.350" style="s2">psycho technology is a socially</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:08.370" style="s2">generated and standardized way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.350" end="00:04:11.740" style="s2">formatting manipulating and enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.370" end="00:04:14.590" style="s2">information processing that&#39;s readily</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.740" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">internalized Abell into human cognition</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.590" end="00:04:20.590" style="s2">and that can be applied in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:23.230" style="s2">domain-general manner that&#39;s crucial it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.590" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">must extend and empower cognition in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.230" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">some reliable and extensive manner and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">be highly generalizable among people</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:37.230" style="s2">prototypical instances are literacy</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:39.800" style="s2">numeracy and graphic</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.230" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">so I want to just make it very clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.800" end="00:04:44.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that anything we use</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:49.020" style="s2">mentally will count as a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.790" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">technology so the cognitive style of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.020" end="00:04:54.420" style="s2">active open-mindedness will probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:57.960" style="s2">make use of psycho technologies in order</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.420" end="00:04:59.790" style="s2">to help track bias but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.960" end="00:05:05.910" style="s2">Stanovich means something much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.790" end="00:05:09.080" style="s2">comprehensive he means a set of skills</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.910" end="00:05:12.660" style="s2">psycho technologies sensibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.080" end="00:05:17.130" style="s2">sensitivities right that will help you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.660" end="00:05:19.590" style="s2">in a domain general manner note and risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.130" end="00:05:24.210" style="s2">actively respond to the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.590" end="00:05:27.150" style="s2">cognitive bias we can then ask what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.210" end="00:05:29.010" style="s2">it about people that if intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.150" end="00:05:32.190" style="s2">insufficient for this what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.010" end="00:05:35.490" style="s2">people that is predictive of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.190" end="00:05:36.830" style="s2">acquiring this right now this is learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.490" end="00:05:40.340" style="s2">Abal right</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.830" end="00:05:43.340" style="s2">and we talked about the need for</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.340" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">cognition as being an important</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.340" end="00:05:52.610" style="s2">predictor so this is the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:57.810" style="s2">you are motivated to go out and look for</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.610" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">problems you&#39;re trying to find formulate</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.810" end="00:06:04.710" style="s2">and solve problems so in that sense you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">are generating your own instances of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.710" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">learning and problem-solving and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:12.300" style="s2">quite directed and comprehensive manner</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">I suggested to you that there&#39;s two ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.300" end="00:06:16.680" style="s2">in which we can think about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:20.100" style="s2">curiosity and wisdom I want to stop here</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.680" end="00:06:22.640" style="s2">and note something about this need for</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.100" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">cognition that I&#39;m now going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.640" end="00:06:29.490" style="s2">making use of in today&#39;s lecture which</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">is the connection between the need for</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.490" end="00:06:35.480" style="s2">cognition and what arlynn calls problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:35.480" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.390" end="00:06:42.950" style="s2">because that&#39;s a very central feature I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.610" end="00:06:45.530" style="s2">would think I would say an essential</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.950" end="00:06:48.610" style="s2">feature of what it is to have a high</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.530" end="00:06:52.640" style="s2">need for cognition Ireland argues that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.610" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">problem finders are very good at finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.640" end="00:06:57.110" style="s2">problems as the name indicates there</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:07:00.260" style="s2">they are able to realize problems and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.110" end="00:07:01.940" style="s2">connect things together in ways that</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.940" end="00:07:06.260" style="s2">done some people have argued that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.280" end="00:07:09.500" style="s2">is central to creativity but important</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.260" end="00:07:11.150" style="s2">for our purposes is that our land and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.500" end="00:07:13.190" style="s2">and this is kind of prescient of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.150" end="00:07:15.980" style="s2">whole argument she made this argument in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.190" end="00:07:19.550" style="s2">1990 she argues that this is she argues</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.980" end="00:07:21.770" style="s2">that this is central to wisdom that one</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.550" end="00:07:24.290" style="s2">of the crucial features of being a wise</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.770" end="00:07:27.410" style="s2">person is the capacity to find problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.290" end="00:07:30.470" style="s2">that other people have not yet found I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.410" end="00:07:32.360" style="s2">want to take a moment here and offer a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.470" end="00:07:34.820" style="s2">suggestion of how we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.360" end="00:07:37.640" style="s2">what makes somebody a good problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.820" end="00:07:40.100" style="s2">finder I want to this is not in Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.640" end="00:07:42.470" style="s2">this is my attempt to extend and develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.100" end="00:07:48.230" style="s2">arlynn and make it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.470" end="00:07:54.740" style="s2">concrete and practicable so I want to I</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.230" end="00:07:57.950" style="s2">want to propose to you this idea we</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.740" end="00:08:00.620" style="s2">don&#39;t find problems typically in a</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.300" end="00:08:09.230" style="s2">dealing with other people are dealing</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:10.760" style="s2">with in our culture I would suggest you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.230" end="00:08:14.050" style="s2">that a good problem finder can do this</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.760" end="00:08:17.210" style="s2">here&#39;s some existing problems in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.050" end="00:08:20.030" style="s2">right space in which human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.210" end="00:08:22.280" style="s2">operating and what a good problem finder</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.030" end="00:08:24.650" style="s2">does is I think not just simply add to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.280" end="00:08:27.290" style="s2">that I mean that that would be kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.650" end="00:08:30.200" style="s2">basic skill and problem solving problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.290" end="00:08:32.630" style="s2">fall problem finding but I think people</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.200" end="00:08:34.310" style="s2">that we regard as being exemplary in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.630" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">this and doing it very well and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.310" end="00:08:38.140" style="s2">therefore demonstrating an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">creativity that helps to explain why</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.140" end="00:08:42.680" style="s2">problem finding sort of overlaps between</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:45.580" style="s2">wisdom and creativity they can do the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.680" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">following thing they can find a problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.580" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">that if solved would make a significant</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">impact</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">on these existing problems so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:08:59.840" style="s2">suggesting to you is that good problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:04.370" style="s2">finding is the ability to generate a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.840" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">problem Nexus so that if you go in and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:08.810" style="s2">say here here are some problems in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:12.890" style="s2">various domains and then they are all</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.810" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">centered on this core problem and if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.890" end="00:09:17.870" style="s2">can address that core problem then we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:21.560" style="s2">can go back and make a significant</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.870" end="00:09:23.270" style="s2">impact on this I think many of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.560" end="00:09:25.910" style="s2">people I don&#39;t take credit for this I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.270" end="00:09:27.020" style="s2">think the person who should be given</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.910" end="00:09:27.590" style="s2">credit for this and I&#39;ll talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.020" end="00:09:31.520" style="s2">later today</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.590" end="00:09:33.620" style="s2">it&#39;s Dreyfus the idea right that many of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.520" end="00:09:35.180" style="s2">the central problems of cognition are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.620" end="00:09:37.310" style="s2">centered on this ability to realize</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.180" end="00:09:41.060" style="s2">relevance I think that&#39;s very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.310" end="00:09:42.620" style="s2">kind of problem finding it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:44.960" style="s2">generation of a problem Nexus and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.620" end="00:09:47.390" style="s2">tried to show you how it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.960" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">generative of theoretical and empirical</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.390" end="00:09:55.220" style="s2">research so I think that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">it is to be a good problem finder it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.220" end="00:10:00.350" style="s2">to generate the problem Nexus I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:02.390" style="s2">want to point out something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.350" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">going to come back to which is this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.390" end="00:10:07.610" style="s2">going to overlap with some an important</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:10.520" style="s2">aspect in some current theories of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.610" end="00:10:14.900" style="s2">nature of understanding that have to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.520" end="00:10:16.940" style="s2">with the effectiveness of how we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.900" end="00:10:18.410" style="s2">relating to knowledge now that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.940" end="00:10:20.390" style="s2">very vague and I will come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.410" end="00:10:22.280" style="s2">more carefully what I need you to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.390" end="00:10:26.150" style="s2">understand right now is that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.280" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">problem finding right this the ability</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.150" end="00:10:31.700" style="s2">to generate a problem Nexus will also</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:33.830" style="s2">make a significant impact interact with</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.700" end="00:10:34.970" style="s2">some of the best accounts I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.830" end="00:10:36.770" style="s2">are emerging about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.970" end="00:10:39.140" style="s2">understanding and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.770" end="00:10:44.360" style="s2">important because we want understanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.140" end="00:10:48.910" style="s2">to be part of our Theory our account of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.360" end="00:10:52.010" style="s2">wisdom now I want to come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.910" end="00:10:55.940" style="s2">effective side of this so I&#39;ve suggested</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.010" end="00:11:00.890" style="s2">to you that one part of good problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.940" end="00:11:03.310" style="s2">finding sorry one part of need for</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.890" end="00:11:03.310" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.510" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">right there&#39;s good problem finding and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.480" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">then good problem finding is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:24.390" style="s2">to generate a problem Nexus right need</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:27.390" style="s2">for cognition I look at this word here</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.390" end="00:11:29.810" style="s2">right also points to obviously an</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.390" end="00:11:32.010" style="s2">effective a motivational component and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.810" end="00:11:36.710" style="s2">this takes us into the few things I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.010" end="00:11:36.710" style="s2">talked about before wonder and curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.400" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">then I propose to you that although</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:45.330" style="s2">these terms are slippery one way in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:48.180" style="s2">which we can pick up a sort of polar</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.330" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">opposites is that curiosity is much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.180" end="00:11:51.570" style="s2">in the having mode it&#39;s much more about</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:53.400" style="s2">manipulating and controlling things and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.570" end="00:11:56.100" style="s2">wonder is much more than the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.400" end="00:11:59.310" style="s2">it&#39;s much more vote on encountering</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.100" end="00:12:01.530" style="s2">mystery and calling into question ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.310" end="00:12:03.950" style="s2">the world view one&#39;s identity etc so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.530" end="00:12:08.760" style="s2">that&#39;s why wonder can shade into awe or</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.950" end="00:12:12.150" style="s2">potentially even into work now I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.760" end="00:12:14.250" style="s2">pick up on something here because this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.150" end="00:12:20.250" style="s2">again has some very deep connections to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.250" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">wisdom so I actually have this on a like</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.250" end="00:12:26.670" style="s2">a plaque in my apartment it&#39;s a famous</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:30.500" style="s2">quote from Socrates which is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.670" end="00:12:34.740" style="s2">begins in wonder wisdom begins in wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.500" end="00:12:36.750" style="s2">and like everything about Socrates it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.740" end="00:12:38.820" style="s2">it is simultaneously provocative and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.750" end="00:12:42.420" style="s2">enigmatic as to what did Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.820" end="00:12:45.690" style="s2">actually mean by that then there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.420" end="00:12:48.390" style="s2">different interpretations and you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.690" end="00:12:52.770" style="s2">see this and the different ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.390" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">wonder is treated by Plato and of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.770" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">by Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.519" end="00:13:04.379" style="s2">and I can see this in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:10.230" style="s2">distinction to some of the current work</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.379" end="00:13:15.439" style="s2">on while on Wonder but for Plato the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.230" end="00:13:20.309" style="s2">point of philosophy is to develop and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.439" end="00:13:23.100" style="s2">extend that sense of wonder so that what</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.309" end="00:13:26.339" style="s2">you&#39;re actually trying to do for Plato</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.100" end="00:13:32.279" style="s2">is you&#39;re trying to deepen wonder into</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.339" end="00:13:35.370" style="s2">awe because he feels that this aw will</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.279" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">have the greatest capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.370" end="00:13:42.569" style="s2">transforming us for getting us deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">involved in the an agogic ascent that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.569" end="00:13:45.809" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">Horace dawdle also thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.809" end="00:13:51.959" style="s2">philosophy begins in wonder but I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:54.389" style="s2">you could make a good case that many</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.959" end="00:13:59.699" style="s2">people have right that Aristotle sees</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.389" end="00:14:03.470" style="s2">this more in line with curiosity trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.699" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">to figure things out and then what your</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.470" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">ultimate ly doing I would say for</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:14.279" style="s2">Aristotle is this you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:17.639" style="s2">basically shape wonder into curiosity in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.279" end="00:14:20.670" style="s2">philosophy and then resolve the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.639" end="00:14:25.889" style="s2">curiosity in some answer to some</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.670" end="00:14:31.730" style="s2">question so for Plato wonder sets you on</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.889" end="00:14:34.139" style="s2">a quest of an agog a but for Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.730" end="00:14:36.809" style="s2">wonder gets you to formulate questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.139" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">that you then answer and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.809" end="00:14:40.350" style="s2">fundamental difference between them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:42.569" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because you see Plato</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.350" end="00:14:47.250" style="s2">is here sort of pushing for meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.569" end="00:14:49.290" style="s2">accommodation as we&#39;ve seen before when</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.250" end="00:14:53.910" style="s2">we talked about this when we talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.290" end="00:14:55.709" style="s2">about right the numinous and Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.910" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">is of course putting for meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.709" end="00:15:02.249" style="s2">assimilation of course when I answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.319" style="s2">questions that may force me to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.249" end="00:15:07.050" style="s2">conceptual accommodation but overall</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.319" end="00:15:09.779" style="s2">this is trying to stabilize right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.050" end="00:15:10.630" style="s2">assimilate and sort of home things for</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.779" end="00:15:12.580" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.630" end="00:15:15.160" style="s2">now the kind of stuff we saw and Garett</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.580" end="00:15:17.650" style="s2">so philosophy is working within that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.160" end="00:15:19.180" style="s2">whole structure and why am i pointing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.650" end="00:15:21.580" style="s2">this out because of course again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.180" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">invoking this higher order relevance</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.580" end="00:15:27.370" style="s2">realization that&#39;s at work within this</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:36.550" style="s2">need for a cognition within wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.370" end="00:15:44.970" style="s2">curiosity all right so we saw that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.550" end="00:15:49.570" style="s2">Stanovich was able to respond to many of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.970" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">the defenders of human rationality in</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.570" end="00:15:53.290" style="s2">the rationality debate he was able to</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.380" end="00:16:02.200" style="s2">assumptions we do not have a sim as</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.120" end="00:16:04.030" style="s2">single competence while I also added in</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.200" end="00:16:08.530" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t think of it as static</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.030" end="00:16:10.420" style="s2">or completely individual all right he</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.530" end="00:16:12.280" style="s2">was able to respond to charity act by</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.080" end="00:17:31.630" style="s2">the idea of a dual processing theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.230" end="00:17:33.400" style="s2">that we have multiple competencies now</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.630" end="00:17:35.590" style="s2">what does dual processing is is itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.400" end="00:17:38.020" style="s2">very controversial initially people</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.590" end="00:17:40.030" style="s2">talked about two systems and then they</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.020" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">talked about two styles and because of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.030" end="00:17:45.820" style="s2">critiques it was hard to maintain those</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">terms and I&#39;m not even convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.820" end="00:17:49.900" style="s2">they are just you know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:53.620" style="s2">distinct things they might lie on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.900" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">continuum but the basic idea so to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.620" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">all that controversy they&#39;re simply</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:18:04.510" style="s2">called s1 and s2 right and like I say</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:06.430" style="s2">I&#39;m not claiming that they&#39;re discrete</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.510" end="00:18:08.740" style="s2">systems or even discrete styles it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.430" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">quite possible that they are polar</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.740" end="00:18:11.980" style="s2">positions with on a continuum of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:13.690" style="s2">processing I&#39;m going to put all other</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.980" end="00:18:16.360" style="s2">side because it&#39;s not relevant for what</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.690" end="00:18:19.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here right so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.360" end="00:18:21.790" style="s2">main idea here is that these are</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.000" end="00:18:25.000" style="s2">different ways in which you process</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.790" end="00:18:32.260" style="s2">information and this process works</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.000" end="00:18:37.290" style="s2">largely intuitively and it works very</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.260" end="00:18:37.290" style="s2">much in a highly associational fashion</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.390" end="00:18:47.950" style="s2">it makes use of a lot of implicit</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.830" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">processing and it&#39;s very fast right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.950" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">very fast</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:18:59.260" style="s2">so this is the kind of processing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.310" end="00:19:00.760" style="s2">you&#39;re using all the time in what we you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.260" end="00:19:03.130" style="s2">know we talked about this one Ravello</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.760" end="00:19:06.070" style="s2">Varela talked about your ability to cope</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.130" end="00:19:08.380" style="s2">those are your coping right so when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.070" end="00:19:11.830" style="s2">moving around the environment I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.380" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">relying a lot on my intuitive knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.830" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">my capacity for implicit learning the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:20.530" style="s2">way I can quickly associate things</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:23.470" style="s2">together right and so I would add to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.530" end="00:19:25.270" style="s2">this of course as I argued before that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.470" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">this is also sort of how we&#39;re primarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.270" end="00:19:30.190" style="s2">caring for things being involved with</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">them finding them salient etc but</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.190" end="00:19:38.110" style="s2">nevertheless this is the this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:44.230" style="s2">part of your cognition that is operating</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.110" end="00:19:46.360" style="s2">a lot of the time in the background in</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.230" end="00:19:48.910" style="s2">fact III want to I&#39;m going to step aside</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.360" end="00:19:50.710" style="s2">from Stanovich for a moment and and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.910" end="00:19:53.170" style="s2">propose to you that instead of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.710" end="00:19:54.850" style="s2">of these of discrete systems we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.170" end="00:19:57.490" style="s2">think of different states where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.850" end="00:19:58.990" style="s2">in where one style or other is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.490" end="00:20:00.520" style="s2">foregrounded and the other is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.990" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">backgrounded so I&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.520" end="00:20:08.350" style="s2">let&#39;s do the what&#39;s s2 well s2 operates</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:10.090" style="s2">more deliberately in both senses of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.350" end="00:20:13.060" style="s2">word like deliberation where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.090" end="00:20:15.190" style="s2">engaging in reflection and deliberate in</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.060" end="00:20:16.930" style="s2">the sense that I am aware of it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.190" end="00:20:20.110" style="s2">intentionally directed in it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.930" end="00:20:22.210" style="s2">deliberately right so it tends to not</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.110" end="00:20:26.910" style="s2">work association ly it tends to work</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.210" end="00:20:26.910" style="s2">inferential e argumentatively</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.800" end="00:20:34.330" style="s2">right argumentation in the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.920" end="00:20:36.430" style="s2">sense not in the sense of having an</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.330" end="00:20:39.430" style="s2">emotional conflict with somebody the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.430" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">processing of course all processing has</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.430" end="00:20:42.850" style="s2">and this is an important point some</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:46.450" style="s2">aspects of it that are implicit so this</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.850" end="00:20:48.520" style="s2">is more of a contrast of emphasis but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.450" end="00:20:55.540" style="s2">this processing is much more explicit</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.520" end="00:20:57.010" style="s2">and it tends to be very slow so Kahneman</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.540" end="00:20:59.530" style="s2">has a book out right now thinking fast</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.010" end="00:21:01.390" style="s2">and thinking slow that is a very good</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.530" end="00:21:03.430" style="s2">sort of discussion of this dual</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.390" end="00:21:05.560" style="s2">processing MA dual processing model</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.430" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">because as I said there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.560" end="00:21:09.460" style="s2">theoretical argumentation and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:11.230" style="s2">that is converging on this so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.460" end="00:21:12.820" style="s2">very highly plausible thing you need you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.230" end="00:21:17.040" style="s2">see it&#39;s showing up in many many</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.820" end="00:21:22.810" style="s2">different domains within psychology</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.040" end="00:21:26.530" style="s2">alright so one way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.810" end="00:21:30.220" style="s2">this and this is a way in which standard</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.530" end="00:21:33.100" style="s2">vision Evans have tried to get a clearer</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.220" end="00:21:34.990" style="s2">more precise way of distinguishing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.100" end="00:21:37.540" style="s2">two is the degree to which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.990" end="00:21:40.120" style="s2">tapping making use of working memory so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.540" end="00:21:43.900" style="s2">the idea is s2</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.120" end="00:21:49.180" style="s2">really relies on working memory whereas</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.900" end="00:21:52.510" style="s2">s1 relies much less on it and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.180" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">much more automatic in that sense in its</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.510" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">operation so</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.340" end="00:22:07.110" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s take an example where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.629" end="00:22:10.379" style="s2">use the two systems right so your</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.110" end="00:22:14.340" style="s2">grocery shopping and you come up to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.379" end="00:22:18.779" style="s2">cashier and they&#39;re ringing you in and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.340" end="00:22:23.309" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a normal sort of basket full</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.779" end="00:22:27.269" style="s2">of normal groceries and the cashier says</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.309" end="00:22:29.309" style="s2">to you well that&#39;ll be $1,000 please and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.269" end="00:22:32.700" style="s2">you know what now where did that what</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.309" end="00:22:34.649" style="s2">come from right what did that what come</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.700" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">from well you have associations between</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.649" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">sort of these objects their prices sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:42.389" style="s2">of the amount you get you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.860" style="s2">picked up implicit patterns right notice</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.389" end="00:22:45.419" style="s2">how intuitively Association aliy</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.860" end="00:22:47.429" style="s2">implicitly and quickly you do what</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.419" end="00:22:50.299" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong it can&#39;t be a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.429" end="00:22:50.299" style="s2">dollars that makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:59.429" style="s2">so you call the cashier and the question</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.629" end="00:23:02.309" style="s2">by using your s1 processing now what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.429" end="00:23:05.850" style="s2">cashier has to do right though she can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.309" end="00:23:06.570" style="s2">just she or he can&#39;t just respond this</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.850" end="00:23:10.529" style="s2">way to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.570" end="00:23:12.379" style="s2">the cashier can&#39;t go nah it&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.529" end="00:23:14.669" style="s2">I can sense it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.379" end="00:23:16.860" style="s2">what this they have to do they have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.669" end="00:23:18.869" style="s2">deliberately no they have to take out</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:41.309" style="s2">these of course are in a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.480" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">relationship because the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.309" end="00:23:45.690" style="s2">remnants of course is instead of it</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.690" end="00:23:51.059" style="s2">problem with this is how much demand it</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.920" end="00:25:46.470" style="s2">got the pond and on day one there&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.470" end="00:25:52.020" style="s2">and on day 20 it&#39;s done on what day was</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.280" end="00:26:01.020" style="s2">how it works and that&#39;s wrong because on</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.170" end="00:26:04.070" style="s2">day 19 half the pond was covered right</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.020" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">and what you have to do is s2 has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.070" end="00:26:12.270" style="s2">basically override how you&#39;re leaping to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:14.250" style="s2">conclusions how you leap to the</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.200" end="00:28:47.410" style="s2">and the fact that it kids this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.410" end="00:28:52.300" style="s2">massively convergent it&#39;s so highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.420" end="00:28:54.309" style="s2">plausible and profound that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.300" end="00:28:59.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s all worthy of being noted</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.309" end="00:29:01.750" style="s2">however let&#39;s look to this because is</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.110" end="00:29:03.430" style="s2">sleeping always a bad thing well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.750" end="00:29:07.990" style="s2">already implied you need to leap to cope</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.430" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">but let&#39;s take a look right at the work</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.990" end="00:29:17.110" style="s2">of Baker Senate and CC from 1996 okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:19.030" style="s2">what they investigated a thing they</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.110" end="00:29:21.309" style="s2">called inductive leaping I think calling</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.030" end="00:29:23.470" style="s2">it inductive leaping is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.309" end="00:29:25.809" style="s2">because I understand induction as an</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.470" end="00:29:27.340" style="s2">inferential procedure and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.809" end="00:29:29.320" style="s2">explicitly doing is not inferential</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.340" end="00:29:32.170" style="s2">nature but it is not inferential in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.320" end="00:29:34.090" style="s2">nature so I&#39;m gonna suggest that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.170" end="00:29:35.530" style="s2">don&#39;t use that term and I&#39;m instead</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.090" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">going to use the more neutral term of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.530" end="00:29:42.370" style="s2">cognitive leaping what&#39;s cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:44.710" style="s2">leaping well cognitive leaping how did</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.370" end="00:29:46.210" style="s2">they test it they tested it in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.710" end="00:29:49.320" style="s2">following way so I give you various</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.210" end="00:29:54.160" style="s2">patterns that are unfolding across time</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.320" end="00:29:56.020" style="s2">and that write at various times I stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.160" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">and I ask you you can tell me what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.020" end="00:30:00.550" style="s2">going to be one version of it is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">like we talked about this before I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.550" end="00:30:04.660" style="s2">bunch of dots and what&#39;s it going to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:05.980" style="s2">and more dots get filled and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.660" end="00:30:07.540" style="s2">you are able to leap and say oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.980" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">going to turn out to be a sofa and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.540" end="00:30:11.410" style="s2">notice how you&#39;re doing stuff really</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.410" end="00:30:14.530" style="s2">doing that leap and you&#39;re going from</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.530" end="00:30:17.830" style="s2">them you&#39;re doing an opacity</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.450" end="00:30:28.420" style="s2">involved now why does that matter well</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:32.309" style="s2">what they found was something very</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.420" end="00:30:34.809" style="s2">important this allowed them to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.309" end="00:30:36.580" style="s2">operationalize kind of the in at least</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.260" end="00:30:42.520" style="s2">going on in an insight there&#39;s this leap</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.520" end="00:30:48.520" style="s2">operationalize it was this you&#39;re a good</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.860" end="00:31:05.070" style="s2">and you&#39;re making lots of mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.760" end="00:31:06.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not very good if you&#39;re largely</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.070" end="00:31:08.190" style="s2">accurate but you have to get a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.840" end="00:31:10.460" style="s2">bunch of cues then you&#39;re not a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.190" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">good leaper but if you use few cues and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.460" end="00:31:17.700" style="s2">get to the full you stall reliably right</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:21.420" style="s2">then you&#39;re a very good cognitive leaper</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.700" end="00:31:24.300" style="s2">okay you&#39;re doing this you have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.420" end="00:31:28.710" style="s2">skill this facility with pattern</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.300" end="00:31:32.130" style="s2">detection pattern completion why is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.710" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">so important well because that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.130" end="00:31:36.060" style="s2">that&#39;s what the experiment show this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:42.660" style="s2">directly predictive of insight the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.060" end="00:31:46.800" style="s2">better you are at leaping the better you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.660" end="00:31:50.250" style="s2">are at insight so do you see the tension</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.800" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">here if I try to shut off too much</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.250" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">leaping to conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.270" end="00:32:02.280" style="s2">I&#39;m also shutting off the machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.960" end="00:32:06.680" style="s2">makes me more insightful it&#39;s right we</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.280" end="00:32:11.160" style="s2">have look we have to give up simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.680" end="00:32:12.860" style="s2">notions naive simplistic notions of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.160" end="00:32:15.210" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.860" end="00:32:18.360" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not accusing Stanovich of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.210" end="00:32:22.160" style="s2">not at all but what I&#39;m saying is we</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.360" end="00:32:25.260" style="s2">have to is it being rational is a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.160" end="00:32:27.720" style="s2">complex process in which there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.260" end="00:32:32.310" style="s2">trade-off relationships and a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.720" end="00:32:37.800" style="s2">complicated kind of optimization needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.310" end="00:32:41.520" style="s2">to be trained so we want active open</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.800" end="00:32:44.330" style="s2">mindedness to prett let&#39;s let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.520" end="00:32:47.100" style="s2">this the error of interference so</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.330" end="00:32:51.180" style="s2">sometimes I leap to conclusions and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.100" end="00:32:52.890" style="s2">causes a lot of mistake in inference the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.180" end="00:32:56.280" style="s2">kind of stuff that Stanovich and what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.890" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">need is active open mindedness to</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.280" end="00:33:02.440" style="s2">moderate that and ameliorate it in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:06.120" style="s2">significant degree right</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.440" end="00:33:09.250" style="s2">I wanted I want to leap to the insight</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.120" end="00:33:12.100" style="s2">and I need that for good control and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.250" end="00:33:13.630" style="s2">good control is central to being a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.100" end="00:33:18.550" style="s2">problem solver essential to being</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.630" end="00:33:20.770" style="s2">rational so what do I need well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.550" end="00:33:23.670" style="s2">interesting because if you turn to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.770" end="00:33:28.390" style="s2">domain outside of the academic domain</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.670" end="00:33:30.370" style="s2">and right we have to because rationality</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.390" end="00:33:32.290" style="s2">is existential we have to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.370" end="00:33:34.930" style="s2">to the context even in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.290" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">theorizing about rationality right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.930" end="00:33:39.550" style="s2">if we&#39;re in a largely academic context</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:43.690" style="s2">we&#39;re going to think of rationality as</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.550" end="00:33:47.380" style="s2">primarily about theorizing and so this</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:50.440" style="s2">is a great danger to theorizing and so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.380" end="00:33:52.420" style="s2">would argue if the rationality if the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.440" end="00:33:54.490" style="s2">project you&#39;re engaging in rationality</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.420" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">is the project of theorizing and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.490" end="00:33:59.070" style="s2">that broadly in the sense of generating</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:01.900" style="s2">scientific you know or historical theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.070" end="00:34:06.430" style="s2">right then active open mindedness is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.900" end="00:34:07.210" style="s2">crucial but there are domains but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.430" end="00:34:09.940" style="s2">goes the other way</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.210" end="00:34:12.940" style="s2">there&#39;s domains in which what you do not</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.940" end="00:34:15.070" style="s2">what you need right is you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.940" end="00:34:19.379" style="s2">able to come up with a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.070" end="00:34:19.379" style="s2">insight when you need a radical</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:28.450" style="s2">reconstruct in where&#39;s it domain and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.159" end="00:34:33.929" style="s2">where that&#39;s crucial well we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.450" end="00:34:33.929" style="s2">about it so this is good for theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:42.810" style="s2">the Jacobs in his book and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.980" end="00:34:46.060" style="s2">some related work by Teasdale points out</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.810" end="00:34:47.710" style="s2">there&#39;s an opposite context there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.060" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">context not of theory but there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.710" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">context of therapy right</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:54.280" style="s2">I think it&#39;s broader than this but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">using this because it&#39;s a good contrast</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.280" end="00:34:59.770" style="s2">and that that right the there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:02.860" style="s2">illiterate of relation to help for</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.770" end="00:35:05.050" style="s2">mnemonic purposes so in therapy very</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.860" end="00:35:07.270" style="s2">often what&#39;s needed is and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.050" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">about this remember your existentially</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.270" end="00:35:10.990" style="s2">trapped and you need this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:13.240" style="s2">kind of transformative insight and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.990" end="00:35:15.760" style="s2">cannot infer your way through it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.240" end="00:35:18.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve already tackled that argument in</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.760" end="00:35:20.170" style="s2">you cannot infer your way through it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:23.130" style="s2">the problem in therapy is people try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.170" end="00:35:25.780" style="s2">think their way through it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.130" end="00:35:28.089" style="s2">that&#39;s Jacob&#39;s main point and I say</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.780" end="00:35:30.280" style="s2">related a book called the ancestral mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.089" end="00:35:32.109" style="s2">and there&#39;s the same point as being made</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.280" end="00:35:33.579" style="s2">and I think by Teasdale when he talks</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.109" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">about metacognitive insight being</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.579" end="00:35:45.430" style="s2">central to therapy often what you need</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:47.859" style="s2">is to try and shut this down try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.430" end="00:35:52.359" style="s2">trigger this let me think of frightened</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.859" end="00:35:55.980" style="s2">free association all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.359" end="00:36:04.930" style="s2">you have to try and shut this down</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.980" end="00:36:07.869" style="s2">prevent it from interfering right bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.930" end="00:36:10.030" style="s2">this into the foreground keep this in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.869" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">the background so when we&#39;re theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.030" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">we need this in the foreground and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.790" style="s2">need it protected we need it too</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:17.980" style="s2">seriously background and constrain this</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.790" end="00:36:20.020" style="s2">active open mindedness in doing this but</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.980" end="00:36:22.150" style="s2">in the therapeutic situation this needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.020" end="00:36:24.339" style="s2">to be much more foregrounded this needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.150" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">to be back rounded and it needs to we it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.339" end="00:36:29.170" style="s2">needs to be constrained so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:31.589" style="s2">unduly interfere with this now with what</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.170" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">we can ask ourselves is well what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.589" end="00:36:43.060" style="s2">cognitive style right that makes this</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:46.450" style="s2">much more focal tries to constrain this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.060" end="00:36:47.109" style="s2">and really improves insight well we know</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.450" end="00:36:49.990" style="s2">what that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.109" end="00:36:52.780" style="s2">and teasdale in fact argues for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.990" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">explicitly and it&#39;s what triggers</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.780" end="00:36:59.109" style="s2">metacognitive insight that&#39;s mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:01.720" style="s2">so you think about how much in a mindful</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.109" end="00:37:04.089" style="s2">in a mindfulness practice I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.720" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">argue that there we need an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.089" end="00:37:08.069" style="s2">psycho technologies to cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:10.510" style="s2">cognitive style of mindfulness right</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.069" end="00:37:12.490" style="s2">think of one think of meditation think</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.510" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">about how much in meditation you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.490" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">trying to write really constrain this</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.740" style="s2">shut this down reduce all that inner</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:23.050" style="s2">speech all that inferential processing</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.740" end="00:37:26.890" style="s2">their deliberate or a direction right</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.050" end="00:37:29.679" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to open this up in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.890" end="00:37:34.809" style="s2">very powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.679" end="00:37:38.029" style="s2">so notice that I now have write a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.809" end="00:37:42.380" style="s2">cognitive style that is in a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.029" end="00:37:45.369" style="s2">important sense opponent not adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.380" end="00:37:48.619" style="s2">but opponent to active open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.369" end="00:37:51.469" style="s2">notice that they are both sharing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.619" end="00:37:52.819" style="s2">training of attention and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.469" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">paying attention to and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.819" end="00:38:04.099" style="s2">paying attention so this is great for</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:07.549" style="s2">planning and this as I said this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.099" end="00:38:09.919" style="s2">great for coping and especially when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.549" end="00:38:12.169" style="s2">planning is epistemic when we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.919" end="00:38:16.509" style="s2">to theorize when we&#39;re planning for</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.169" end="00:38:18.679" style="s2">truth this is very good for coping</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.509" end="00:38:20.599" style="s2">especially when we&#39;re doing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.679" end="00:38:22.339" style="s2">coping that&#39;s therapeutic in a broad</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.599" end="00:38:25.219" style="s2">sense in which we are needing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.339" end="00:38:32.599" style="s2">transform and undergo important</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.219" end="00:38:36.229" style="s2">qualitative development so I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.599" end="00:38:39.919" style="s2">what&#39;s missing from Stanovich is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.229" end="00:38:45.259" style="s2">broader account of our competences and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.919" end="00:38:46.819" style="s2">how they can be how they are played off</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.259" end="00:38:49.099" style="s2">against each other how there&#39;s a trade</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.819" end="00:38:51.109" style="s2">off relationship with them and part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.099" end="00:38:53.630" style="s2">what I would argue and I&#39;m going to come</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.109" end="00:38:56.479" style="s2">back to this more more directly later</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.630" end="00:38:58.699" style="s2">what goes into wisdom is a cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.479" end="00:39:01.039" style="s2">of both active open mindedness for</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.699" end="00:39:02.479" style="s2">inference and mindfulness for insight</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.039" end="00:39:04.459" style="s2">and then what we&#39;re going to need is</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.479" end="00:39:06.619" style="s2">well what what coordinates them together</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.459" end="00:39:09.019" style="s2">how are they coordinated together how do</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.619" end="00:39:10.939" style="s2">i optimize the opponent not adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.019" end="00:39:13.130" style="s2">how do i optimize the opponent</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.939" end="00:39:16.519" style="s2">processing between them I want to come</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.130" end="00:39:20.299" style="s2">back to that and explore that in detail</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.519" end="00:39:23.089" style="s2">with you because I can&#39;t push this any</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.299" end="00:39:24.559" style="s2">farther because as we as we push this</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.089" end="00:39:26.449" style="s2">farther we&#39;re getting farther and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.559" end="00:39:28.999" style="s2">farther away from Stanovich who&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.449" end="00:39:30.650" style="s2">and moving in towards a theory that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.999" end="00:39:32.479" style="s2">myself I&#39;m going to propose to you the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.650" end="00:39:35.150" style="s2">work I&#39;ve done with Lea Ferraro and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.479" end="00:39:37.519" style="s2">sort of critically reflect on that so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.150" end="00:39:39.469" style="s2">need you to remember this for when we</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.519" end="00:39:41.059" style="s2">come back to more explicitly talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.469" end="00:39:42.760" style="s2">a theory of wisdom and to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.059" end="00:39:46.820" style="s2">descent of it she&#39;s ultimately no</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.760" end="00:39:49.700" style="s2">offering a theory of wisdom and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.820" end="00:39:52.040" style="s2">when he talks about rationality he</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.700" end="00:39:54.920" style="s2">really means theoretical rationality as</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.040" end="00:40:00.010" style="s2">opposed to what we might call practical</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.920" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">or therapeutic rationality ok I want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.010" end="00:40:06.020" style="s2">stop here though and note it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:08.810" style="s2">continue on with our investigation now</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.020" end="00:40:11.230" style="s2">of explicit theories of wisdom but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.810" end="00:40:13.369" style="s2">want to sort of pull one thing out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.230" end="00:40:15.710" style="s2">our discussion of substantive itch</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.369" end="00:40:21.500" style="s2">before we leave stand of itches good</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.710" end="00:40:23.720" style="s2">company and I want to use somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.500" end="00:40:26.260" style="s2">else&#39;s work to extend that a bit and to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.720" end="00:40:28.580" style="s2">just add more teeth to this claim that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.260" end="00:40:34.820" style="s2">rationality is ultimately an existential</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.580" end="00:40:36.650" style="s2">issue a way of understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.820" end="00:40:40.540" style="s2">Stanovich says is the following</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.650" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">right when I use intelligence to learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.540" end="00:40:46.190" style="s2">the psycho tech and the cognitive stock</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:48.890" style="s2">I can use intelligence to actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.190" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">improve how I&#39;m using my intelligence I</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.890" end="00:40:54.410" style="s2">can use my intelligence to improve right</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:57.260" style="s2">how the competencies are optimizing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.410" end="00:41:00.500" style="s2">I can therefore overall enhance my</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.260" end="00:41:06.339" style="s2">capacity for relevance realization we</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.500" end="00:41:06.339" style="s2">can think of that as rationality</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.780" end="00:41:15.780" style="s2">but something else is emerging right out</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.690" end="00:41:18.940" style="s2">of this which I&#39;m only suggesting now</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.780" end="00:41:22.660" style="s2">but we may perhaps be able to use our</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.940" end="00:41:26.650" style="s2">rationality to improve our rationality</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.660" end="00:41:29.530" style="s2">to make it more optimal overall and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.650" end="00:41:31.960" style="s2">would suggest to you that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.530" end="00:41:34.780" style="s2">crucial to wisdom that that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.960" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">be an essential feature I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.780" end="00:41:37.090" style="s2">argue not everybody agrees with me on</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:39.340" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m trying to be really clear</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.090" end="00:41:42.700" style="s2">about this but I would argue that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.340" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">is a place in which we can find the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.700" end="00:41:47.110" style="s2">locus for understanding the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:50.980" style="s2">wisdom how it relates to rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.110" end="00:41:53.500" style="s2">how it relates to intelligence what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.980" end="00:41:56.380" style="s2">nature of this is we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.500" end="00:41:58.750" style="s2">come back to one more time please</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.380" end="00:42:01.030" style="s2">remember when you see this word that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.750" end="00:42:03.010" style="s2">am NOT equating it to logic allottee or</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.030" end="00:42:05.110" style="s2">intelligence I&#39;ve given you long</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.010" end="00:42:08.530" style="s2">arguments but I&#39;ve tried to expand this</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.110" end="00:42:12.010" style="s2">notion right it&#39;s is much more about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.530" end="00:42:14.710" style="s2">reliable and systematic ability to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.010" end="00:42:17.530" style="s2">overcome self-deception and to afford</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.710" end="00:42:19.990" style="s2">the enhancement of development and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.530" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">meaning in life that&#39;s what I mean by it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.990" end="00:42:29.410" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s keep this in mind let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:32.380" style="s2">take some time now right to take a look</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.410" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">at some more explicit theories of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.380" end="00:42:38.350" style="s2">I can&#39;t look at them all this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:41.080" style="s2">is a growth industry I&#39;m going to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.350" end="00:42:43.000" style="s2">conference tomorrow with it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.080" end="00:42:45.100" style="s2">the people that are working in this and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.000" end="00:42:46.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a discussion to try and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.100" end="00:42:49.480" style="s2">see if we can come to some consensus</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.600" end="00:42:51.850" style="s2">about this precisely because it is such</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.480" end="00:42:54.520" style="s2">an important topic a lot of good work</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.850" end="00:42:56.500" style="s2">has been done on it but again because</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.520" end="00:42:59.500" style="s2">there is such a multitude of viewpoints</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.500" end="00:43:01.780" style="s2">getting a clear consensus on this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.500" end="00:43:07.000" style="s2">going to be it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.780" end="00:43:11.110" style="s2">theoretical challenge okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.000" end="00:43:12.940" style="s2">now the I want to as I said do one more</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.110" end="00:43:15.580" style="s2">thing before I do that before I move to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.940" end="00:43:19.830" style="s2">the explicit theories and I want to show</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.580" end="00:43:19.830" style="s2">you I want to show you a bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.570" end="00:43:31.120" style="s2">and the point about this is to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.910" end="00:43:32.680" style="s2">something that stander which is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.120" end="00:43:34.660" style="s2">addressing which is the existential</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.680" end="00:43:37.480" style="s2">aspect of rationally the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.660" end="00:43:41.890" style="s2">we identify with our higher cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.480" end="00:43:46.120" style="s2">processes okay so this is the work of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.890" end="00:43:51.220" style="s2">Dweck Carol Dweck and it&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.120" end="00:43:53.320" style="s2">mindset she has a book entitled that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.220" end="00:43:54.580" style="s2">this is course is again an ongoing thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.320" end="00:43:59.470" style="s2">it&#39;s been taking up in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.580" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">different research so I want to describe</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.470" end="00:44:07.170" style="s2">an experiment to you and and then I want</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.910" end="00:44:11.530" style="s2">to sort of challenge a little bit a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.170" end="00:44:14.050" style="s2">potential ambiguity or confusion in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.530" end="00:44:16.980" style="s2">Dweck that I think we can clarify by</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.050" end="00:44:20.410" style="s2">making use of this work from Stanovich</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.980" end="00:44:22.930" style="s2">so what did the following thing sheet he</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.410" end="00:44:27.070" style="s2">brought she had a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.930" end="00:44:28.270" style="s2">experiments but let&#39;s talk about one she</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.070" end="00:44:30.460" style="s2">brought in a bunch of school children</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.270" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">and she randomly assigned them to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.460" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">three groups Group a group B and Group C</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.730" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">now Dweck talks about two different ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.350" end="00:44:55.230" style="s2">in which you can set your mind towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">your your traits and the trait that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.230" end="00:44:59.130" style="s2">really crucial hood and this is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:00.750" style="s2">is intelligence so she talks about two</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.130" end="00:45:02.520" style="s2">views you can have two ways in which you</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.750" end="00:45:04.020" style="s2">can set your mind now it&#39;s a mindset</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.520" end="00:45:05.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just a belief it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.020" end="00:45:08.460" style="s2">way in which you are identifying with</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.880" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s the way in which you feel you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.460" end="00:45:12.690" style="s2">are embodying the the traits we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:15.150" style="s2">talking about so you can have a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.690" end="00:45:20.760" style="s2">view of your intelligence or a malleable</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.150" end="00:45:23.460" style="s2">view okay and so in the fixed view you</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.760" end="00:45:26.130" style="s2">think intelligence is like fixed</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.460" end="00:45:28.350" style="s2">basically sort of birth or earlier on</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.130" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">and then once it&#39;s locked in there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.350" end="00:45:32.460" style="s2">much you can do with it so for example</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:34.740" style="s2">my height is affixed to trait there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.460" end="00:45:38.430" style="s2">not a lot I can do to modify it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.740" end="00:45:40.590" style="s2">fixed trait okay my weight is a much</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.430" end="00:45:42.120" style="s2">more malleable trait I can change it can</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.590" end="00:45:44.850" style="s2">it&#39;s quite variable it can change quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.120" end="00:45:46.110" style="s2">a bit so you may think that intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.850" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">is more like my height you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.110" end="00:45:50.150" style="s2">born with it you&#39;re fixed you got this</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:52.740" style="s2">number assigned and that&#39;s it or</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.150" end="00:46:00.840" style="s2">intelligence is malleable it can develop</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.740" end="00:46:02.790" style="s2">and change now notice your behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.840" end="00:46:05.010" style="s2">going to be different if you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.790" end="00:46:08.340" style="s2">intelligence is fixed if you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.010" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">intelligence is fixed your attitude</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.340" end="00:46:24.780" style="s2">towards error is that error will reveal</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:27.540" style="s2">that you have a defect in a non</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.780" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">changeable trait it&#39;ll reveal it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.540" end="00:46:36.420" style="s2">it&#39;ll permanently disclose that you are</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:42.710" style="s2">not smart so fixed intelligence tends to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.420" end="00:46:42.710" style="s2">turn error into permanent revelation</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.100" end="00:46:49.080" style="s2">right if I make mistakes that will show</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.070" end="00:46:51.000" style="s2">that I have low intelligence and once</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.080" end="00:46:52.590" style="s2">once everybody knows that including</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.000" end="00:46:53.339" style="s2">myself there&#39;s nothing I can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.590" end="00:46:58.259" style="s2">and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.339" end="00:47:00.299" style="s2">doomed to being a stupid person okay if</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.259" end="00:47:05.880" style="s2">you have the malleable view of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.299" end="00:47:10.170" style="s2">intelligence error doesn&#39;t right error</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.880" end="00:47:13.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do that for you there doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.170" end="00:47:18.690" style="s2">see error is now oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.369" end="00:47:21.450" style="s2">error points towards the skills I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.690" end="00:47:22.619" style="s2">using I need better skills or the effort</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.450" end="00:47:24.989" style="s2">I&#39;m putting it I need to put in more</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.619" end="00:47:26.849" style="s2">effort because if it&#39;s malleable I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.989" end="00:47:29.039" style="s2">do things to change it so the error says</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.849" end="00:47:30.269" style="s2">the errors brace is pointing you need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.039" end="00:47:31.890" style="s2">make some changes you need to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.269" end="00:47:34.019" style="s2">more skills you need to call to more</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.890" end="00:47:34.849" style="s2">effort now notice something right away</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.019" end="00:47:37.859" style="s2">please</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.849" end="00:47:41.960" style="s2">notice how the fixed view focuses you on</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.859" end="00:47:44.670" style="s2">the product right it focuses you on</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.960" end="00:47:50.130" style="s2">right you just get fixated on the error</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.670" end="00:47:52.799" style="s2">oh no this focus is you remember the key</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.130" end="00:47:57.960" style="s2">of rationality it focuses you on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.799" end="00:47:59.759" style="s2">process the process okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.960" end="00:48:02.130" style="s2">so she has a lot of experiments showing</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.759" end="00:48:04.650" style="s2">that right to fix you and the malleable</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.130" end="00:48:09.329" style="s2">view have a huge impact on your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.650" end="00:48:11.190" style="s2">but interesting thing the way how could</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.329" end="00:48:12.690" style="s2">how can you trigger people into this</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.190" end="00:48:15.269" style="s2">mode well if you&#39;re in sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.690" end="00:48:17.219" style="s2">authority position like like like being</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.269" end="00:48:20.759" style="s2">a teacher out of school the one way you</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.219" end="00:48:23.700" style="s2">can trigger the mode and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.759" end="00:48:28.200" style="s2">a mode right the mode that people are in</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.700" end="00:48:32.130" style="s2">is how you praise them the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.200" end="00:48:34.829" style="s2">feedback you give them if I praise you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.130" end="00:48:38.460" style="s2">using trait language like you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.829" end="00:48:42.269" style="s2">smart you&#39;re so bright that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.460" end="00:48:44.670" style="s2">tend to trigger this orientation if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.269" end="00:48:46.529" style="s2">praise you for the process wow you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.670" end="00:48:48.029" style="s2">really you&#39;re using a really good skill</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.529" end="00:48:49.950" style="s2">you&#39;re putting in a lot of effort for</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.029" end="00:48:52.019" style="s2">that that&#39;s going to make the process</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.950" end="00:48:54.539" style="s2">salient to you the more I make this</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.019" end="00:48:56.729" style="s2">salient the more you&#39;re going to be in</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.539" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">that mode the more I make this salient</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.729" end="00:49:03.589" style="s2">anymore you&#39;re going to be in that mode</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:03.589" style="s2">okay so I can praise the trait</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.130" end="00:49:11.180" style="s2">right or I can praise the process think</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.650" end="00:49:13.940" style="s2">about how important this is to parenting</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.180" end="00:49:16.310" style="s2">or schooling okay so let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.940" end="00:49:18.290" style="s2">the experiment we have these three</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.310" end="00:49:20.840" style="s2">groups the three group it&#39;s the control</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.290" end="00:49:22.610" style="s2">group they&#39;re all given a set of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.840" end="00:49:23.840" style="s2">problems that have been pre-tested for I</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.610" end="00:49:25.010" style="s2">think they were great for it they could</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.840" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">all solve these problems they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.010" end="00:49:29.420" style="s2">challenging but they&#39;re all solvable and</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:33.260" style="s2">they all solve them so all groups solve</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.420" end="00:49:37.160" style="s2">them but group a is praised for its</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.260" end="00:49:38.990" style="s2">trait Group B is praised for the process</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.160" end="00:49:41.720" style="s2">and then Group C is given the neutral</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.990" end="00:49:43.730" style="s2">just acknowledgement oh oh the praises</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.720" end="00:49:50.330" style="s2">we you succeeded so well in that problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.730" end="00:49:52.490" style="s2">okay so neutral so the idea is this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.330" end="00:49:54.080" style="s2">going to trigger right these people into</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.490" end="00:49:56.120" style="s2">the fixed view that&#39;s going to trigger</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.080" end="00:49:58.580" style="s2">people into the value of all view so now</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.120" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">what you do is you give the kids a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.580" end="00:50:04.070" style="s2">of tests you ask which ones want to take</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:05.840" style="s2">on some more challenging problems notice</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.070" end="00:50:07.550" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing here i&#39;m looking for need</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.840" end="00:50:11.170" style="s2">for cognition looking for need for</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.550" end="00:50:13.970" style="s2">cognition what i find is this group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.170" end="00:50:16.460" style="s2">sorry that was completely wrong descrip</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.970" end="00:50:20.570" style="s2">says no i don&#39;t want to try harder</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.460" end="00:50:23.030" style="s2">problems why because if they try harder</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.570" end="00:50:25.160" style="s2">problems there&#39;s a very good chance that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.030" end="00:50:28.340" style="s2">they will generate error and then error</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.160" end="00:50:29.540" style="s2">will generate right the recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.340" end="00:50:31.490" style="s2">they&#39;re less intelligent and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.540" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">they&#39;re permanently stained with that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.490" end="00:50:36.920" style="s2">permanently marked the process people</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.440" end="00:50:39.530" style="s2">say yeah I&#39;d like to try harder problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.920" end="00:50:42.910" style="s2">they have a need for cognition seems to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.530" end="00:50:45.830" style="s2">be triggered of course neutral right</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.910" end="00:50:48.890" style="s2">then you give them some harder problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.830" end="00:50:53.950" style="s2">and ask do they enjoy them and do do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.890" end="00:50:53.950" style="s2">not enjoy this yeah I enjoy this neutral</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:51:01.550" style="s2">now here&#39;s the crucial thing now you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.100" end="00:51:03.980" style="s2">give them a set of problems that were</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.550" end="00:51:05.600" style="s2">equal in difficulty to the first set of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.980" end="00:51:07.070" style="s2">problems you get us give them a set of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.600" end="00:51:08.300" style="s2">problems that were equal in difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.070" end="00:51:09.980" style="s2">to the first Center problem this has all</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.300" end="00:51:12.950" style="s2">been massively pre-tested so it&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.980" end="00:51:15.320" style="s2">right and what you find is this group</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.950" end="00:51:17.030" style="s2">does about the same this group does much</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.320" end="00:51:19.240" style="s2">worse and this group that&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.030" end="00:51:19.240" style="s2">it did</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:27.320" style="s2">and now I want to I want to extend this</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.460" end="00:51:31.010" style="s2">and notice how this is starting to fold</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.320" end="00:51:34.430" style="s2">into a kind of self-deception right you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.010" end="00:51:36.200" style="s2">asked these kids to write - I believe</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.430" end="00:51:38.210" style="s2">the experiment was done in America you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.200" end="00:51:40.520" style="s2">ask these people to write to a student</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.210" end="00:51:42.710" style="s2">in Germany that they&#39;ll never they will</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.520" end="00:51:46.369" style="s2">never meet by the way and report how</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.710" end="00:51:49.580" style="s2">they did on the experiment so these two</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.369" end="00:51:52.820" style="s2">groups write largely tell the truth they</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.580" end="00:52:01.090" style="s2">just took you know 40 percent of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.820" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">people lie about their performance okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.090" end="00:52:08.170" style="s2">what am I trying to show you I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:11.300" style="s2">to show you the way you frame yourself</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.170" end="00:52:15.890" style="s2">the way you identify with your</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.300" end="00:52:18.470" style="s2">processing has a huge impact on your</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.890" end="00:52:20.359" style="s2">problem-solving ability your proclivity</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.470" end="00:52:23.780" style="s2">for self-deception and your need for</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.359" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">cognition rationality is an existential</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.780" end="00:52:32.540" style="s2">thing it is not just an informational</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:37.010" style="s2">processing thing now one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.540" end="00:52:42.700" style="s2">comes out of this is the question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.010" end="00:52:42.700" style="s2">but is intelligence fixed or malleable</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:56.490" style="s2">and and wek is not quite clear about</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.300" end="00:52:58.810" style="s2">that the evidence is pretty clear that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.490" end="00:53:01.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a few things you can do to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.810" end="00:53:03.550" style="s2">modify your intelligence there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.690" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">suggestion that long-term mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.550" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">practice by enhancing attention and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:12.849" style="s2">working memory can improve your your</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:15.400" style="s2">measures of general intelligence but by</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.849" end="00:53:17.890" style="s2">and large intelligence is is fixed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.400" end="00:53:19.750" style="s2">not that malleable and then you may say</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.890" end="00:53:25.170" style="s2">okay then this whole thing is based on</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.750" end="00:53:27.910" style="s2">you know lying to the kids right</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.170" end="00:53:29.859" style="s2">basically getting them to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.910" end="00:53:34.060" style="s2">intelligence is something malleable not</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.859" end="00:53:35.530" style="s2">really not really at all because what</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.060" end="00:53:36.460" style="s2">we&#39;re actually talking about here and</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.530" end="00:53:38.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been continually</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.460" end="00:53:39.880" style="s2">alluding to here is that something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.140" end="00:53:43.859" style="s2">is terrifically there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.880" end="00:53:43.859" style="s2">intelligence is terrifically malleable</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.810" end="00:53:50.460" style="s2">and this is exactly what mine setting is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.520" end="00:53:55.540" style="s2">the way in which intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.460" end="00:53:56.710" style="s2">recursively relates to itself is a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.540" end="00:53:58.599" style="s2">in which we can think about it being</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.710" end="00:53:59.530" style="s2">rational but that might sorry the way in</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.599" end="00:54:01.720" style="s2">which we can think about it being</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.530" end="00:54:03.400" style="s2">malleable and you my word slip shows you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.720" end="00:54:05.410" style="s2">what my thinking is a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.400" end="00:54:07.630" style="s2">talking about this is that intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.410" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">is fixed and this is what what Santa</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.630" end="00:54:14.320" style="s2">bitches argues but rationality is highly</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:19.359" style="s2">malleable and then here&#39;s Stanovich</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.320" end="00:54:20.950" style="s2">whose main point about this we care too</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.359" end="00:54:23.859" style="s2">much for intelligence and not enough for</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.950" end="00:54:25.330" style="s2">rationality because yes intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.859" end="00:54:27.250" style="s2">highly predictive of all these things</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.330" end="00:54:30.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s why measurements of G are</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.250" end="00:54:31.990" style="s2">such powerful predictors but if I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.220" end="00:54:33.430" style="s2">to know something about you now</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.990" end="00:54:35.500" style="s2">following state of itches argument I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.430" end="00:54:38.050" style="s2">want to know not how intelligent you are</p>

<p begin="00:54:38.050" end="00:54:45.180" style="s2">that is highly malleable okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.800" end="00:54:48.520" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to show you is this that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.180" end="00:54:50.680" style="s2">rationality is an existential issue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.520" end="00:54:53.320" style="s2">about how you&#39;re identifying with your</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.680" end="00:54:55.300" style="s2">own cognitive processing and the way in</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.320" end="00:54:57.849" style="s2">which that identification process can</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.300" end="00:54:58.190" style="s2">impede how you&#39;re applying and using an</p>

<p begin="00:54:58.190" end="00:55:03.140" style="s2">or it can enhance it and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.410" end="00:55:05.780" style="s2">the possibility right of cultivating the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.140" end="00:55:07.550" style="s2">right kind of recursion and identity the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.780" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">right kinds of cognitive styles so</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.550" end="00:55:11.720" style="s2">somehow we have to put processes of</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:14.060" style="s2">identification processes of coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.720" end="00:55:19.580" style="s2">cognitive styles together and we can get</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.060" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">a clear path for becoming much more</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.580" end="00:55:25.550" style="s2">rational and as I&#39;m suggesting to you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:28.580" style="s2">therefore much more wise because if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.550" end="00:55:30.800" style="s2">if we use rationality to better learn</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.580" end="00:55:33.380" style="s2">how to use rationality and identify with</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.800" end="00:55:35.420" style="s2">our rationality then of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.380" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">suggesting to you that&#39;s wisdom and as I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.420" end="00:55:41.360" style="s2">promised we should now next we should</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:45.800" style="s2">now turn to some of the explicit</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.360" end="00:55:47.600" style="s2">psychological theories of wisdom now I</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.800" end="00:55:51.820" style="s2">can&#39;t as I&#39;ve already mentioned I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.600" end="00:55:53.660" style="s2">do all of them I&#39;m gonna zero in on four</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.820" end="00:55:56.750" style="s2">theories that I think are quite</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.660" end="00:55:59.480" style="s2">representative of central ideas in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.750" end="00:56:02.330" style="s2">psychology of wisdom I and then I will</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.480" end="00:56:04.070" style="s2">then propose I&#39;ll put my I&#39;ll propose my</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.330" end="00:56:06.140" style="s2">theory that work I&#39;ve done with Leo</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.070" end="00:56:08.570" style="s2">Ferraro and I&#39;ll put that into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.140" end="00:56:12.620" style="s2">dialogue with these existing theories as</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.570" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">well as critiquing the theory that I the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.620" end="00:56:16.310" style="s2">work that I did with Leo and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:19.820" style="s2">ultimately what we want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.310" end="00:56:22.210" style="s2">resituated account of wisdom right into</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.820" end="00:56:26.650" style="s2">its connection with the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.210" end="00:56:28.940" style="s2">meaning and the pursuit of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.650" end="00:56:30.890" style="s2">we will take a look at that next time</p>
