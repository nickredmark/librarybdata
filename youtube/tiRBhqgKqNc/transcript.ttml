<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:50.899" style="s2">practice so we have time for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.759" end="00:16:53.089" style="s2">questions one is from Dean ruble I find</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.899" end="00:16:55.670" style="s2">my Letta mantra&#39; turns into a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.089" end="00:16:57.679" style="s2">prayer 11 step recovery related then</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.670" end="00:16:59.689" style="s2">just fall back into the past now after</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.679" end="00:17:01.730" style="s2">those I visualize had dissipated in any</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.689" end="00:17:03.769" style="s2">temporal issues with this so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.730" end="00:17:08.329" style="s2">question I would ask you to Dean is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.769" end="00:17:11.779" style="s2">is when it becomes a prayer not that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.329" end="00:17:13.970" style="s2">familiar with 12 steps I&#39;ve dated</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.779" end="00:17:17.740" style="s2">somebody at one time and I went to some</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.970" end="00:17:21.559" style="s2">meetings I have some sense of it but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.740" end="00:17:23.059" style="s2">guess the thing I want to know is when</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.559" end="00:17:25.429" style="s2">you&#39;re into that prayer state is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.059" end="00:17:28.010" style="s2">doing what the meta is intended to do is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.429" end="00:17:29.990" style="s2">it doing that reciprocal opening are you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.010" end="00:17:32.179" style="s2">moving are you letting go of categorical</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.990" end="00:17:35.539" style="s2">identities are you opening up in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.179" end="00:17:37.789" style="s2">reciprocal fashion like a reciprocal and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.539" end="00:17:40.520" style="s2">couple fashion the mortise within and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.789" end="00:17:42.950" style="s2">the mortise without our use very</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.520" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">basically remembering the being mode if</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.950" end="00:17:47.539" style="s2">that&#39;s happening then the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:49.070" style="s2">prayer like is fine there are various</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.539" end="00:17:52.429" style="s2">forms of meditation Christian meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.070" end="00:17:54.020" style="s2">that overlap with prayer in this manner</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.429" end="00:17:56.539" style="s2">so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.020" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">that&#39;s fine if after you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.539" end="00:18:01.640" style="s2">visualized the people what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:03.770" style="s2">you know it sort of dissipates and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.640" end="00:18:06.710" style="s2">return to the past no that&#39;s fine as</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.770" end="00:18:08.899" style="s2">well but see once you when you realize</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.710" end="00:18:11.779" style="s2">you&#39;re back into Posner see you can then</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.899" end="00:18:14.270" style="s2">just gently go back out to where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.779" end="00:18:17.960" style="s2">were in meta and then let it come back</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.270" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">to the past and generally it again and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.960" end="00:18:25.429" style="s2">then back this is a question from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:27.529" style="s2">music group I find while I&#39;m meditating</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.429" end="00:18:28.909" style="s2">when mouth fills with saliva or I get to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.529" end="00:18:30.950" style="s2">the ER to swallow is there anything I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.909" end="00:18:34.039" style="s2">to prevent this that it often becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.950" end="00:18:35.620" style="s2">distraction so just follow as much as</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.039" end="00:18:39.340" style="s2">you want for a while</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.620" end="00:18:40.659" style="s2">okay just keep swallowing you&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.340" end="00:18:41.789" style="s2">up the habit that you don&#39;t notice that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.659" end="00:18:44.230" style="s2">throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.789" end="00:18:45.730" style="s2">so you know you&#39;ve got monkey mind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.230" end="00:18:47.409" style="s2">figured out a thing to use to distract</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.730" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">you but throughout the day you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.409" end="00:18:50.890" style="s2">probably swallowing without noticing so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:53.650" style="s2">just let yourself swallow just swallow</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.890" end="00:18:55.240" style="s2">swallow a lot all oh and then keep going</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.650" end="00:18:56.890" style="s2">back to the breath again and again again</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.240" end="00:18:59.710" style="s2">and what you&#39;re trying to do is trigger</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.890" end="00:19:00.940" style="s2">your deeper long-standing habit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.710" end="00:19:03.100" style="s2">swallowing throughout the day without</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.940" end="00:19:04.510" style="s2">giving you to these special noticing but</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.100" end="00:19:06.789" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re sort of trying not</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.510" end="00:19:09.100" style="s2">to notice it is making it&#39;s alien so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.789" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">sort of have to okay befriend it I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.100" end="00:19:15.309" style="s2">just swallow you&#39;ll take my attention</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:17.620" style="s2">for a bit I&#39;ll label it swallowing ing</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.309" end="00:19:18.940" style="s2">and then return to the breath again and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.620" end="00:19:21.610" style="s2">again and again and eventually what will</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.940" end="00:19:25.059" style="s2">happen is that will fall away into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.610" end="00:19:26.710" style="s2">background and a career i watch the net</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.059" end="00:19:29.470" style="s2">instructions a few times but I still</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.710" end="00:19:31.000" style="s2">only come out as asking three four</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.470" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">questions that feel like not really</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.000" end="00:19:38.169" style="s2">getting in yet is it okay to stay with</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:39.850" style="s2">training the arrow for now yes yes so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.169" end="00:19:42.340" style="s2">you&#39;re getting a strong sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:44.940" style="s2">need to keep working on the capacitor</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.340" end="00:19:51.399" style="s2">for a while and that needs to get deeper</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.940" end="00:19:54.580" style="s2">before you can move it to better that do</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.399" end="00:19:59.470" style="s2">that maybe try once a week doing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.580" end="00:20:02.649" style="s2">meadow and and then try also throughout</p>
