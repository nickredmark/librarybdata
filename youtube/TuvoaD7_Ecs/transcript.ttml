<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">it does take a village to raise a child</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:24.830" style="s2">and so being able to coordinate that no</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:28.920" style="s2">matter whether you&#39;re a single parent or</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">a Mize risk and maximize reward I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">in maximizing reward you minimize risk</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:12.750" style="s2">in this case so and it takes a village</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:15.450" style="s2">app that helps you coordinate having</p>
