<p begin="00:01:51.350" end="00:01:56.540" style="s2">understand the deeper structures that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.729" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">were functioning on so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.540" end="00:02:01.619" style="s2">deconstruct how we&#39;re doing things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">reconstruct something new which I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.619" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">you are familiar with the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:09.170" style="s2">Soviet ed coagula from alchemy and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">those who don&#39;t know it&#39;s Latin for</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.170" end="00:02:14.550" style="s2">deconstruct and reconstitute and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:16.860" style="s2">idea is that everything is made up of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.550" end="00:02:19.070" style="s2">certain components and layers and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.860" end="00:02:21.960" style="s2">you can go down the layers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.070" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">deconstruct or or destroy the upper</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.960" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">layers and then rebuild them so for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">that that comes up a lot recently and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:30.690" style="s2">because it seems that that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">have to do on many levels and in society</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.690" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">in how we see ourselves and how we see</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">ourselves in relationship to our earth</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">etc etc I was gonna say I see what</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">you&#39;re saying in terms of to quote</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:43.350" style="s2">Daniel he keeps talking about generator</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:44.850" style="s2">functions and it seems like this is one</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.350" end="00:02:47.130" style="s2">of those things that&#39;s a generator</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.850" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">function of having a catalyst for change</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.130" end="00:02:53.670" style="s2">in the world so people who both enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:55.350" style="s2">and know how to self teach and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.670" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">continue learning and and to pick</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.350" end="00:03:00.270" style="s2">domains that are of value to them into</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">the world and then to go deep into those</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.270" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">domains so it seems like and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">something I believed and it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.630" style="s2">important to me is like the love of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:12.180" style="s2">learning and the ability to learn at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.630" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">maximum rate that you can learn that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.180" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">been super important I like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">kind of what you&#39;ve latched on to in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">this conversation yeah there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">of things that I think that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">bring up so one is this remember I used</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:28.220" style="s2">the metaphor of a radio antenna going</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">from noise to signal the point there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.220" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to hear the music and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">you&#39;re at I think it was eighty nine</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:40.170" style="s2">point nine you&#39;re going to have to try</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:43.530" style="s2">really really hard to hear a very small</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.170" end="00:03:45.660" style="s2">amount of music but if you just tuned</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:49.739" style="s2">the radio ever so slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.660" end="00:03:53.180" style="s2">literally one notch up it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.739" end="00:03:55.670" style="s2">effortless to hear all of the music now</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.180" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a characteristic of reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.670" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">reality has this characteristic that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">there are is a relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;ve constructed an</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.630" style="s2">instrument that is deeply attuned to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.630" end="00:04:11.750" style="s2">and hear it now becomes an ethical rule</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:15.540" style="s2">of thumb if you have a choice between</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.750" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">tuning your instrument or trying to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.540" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">your instrument harder tune your</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">instrument sharpen the soft yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:28.159" style="s2">this mist of attunement is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:31.259" style="s2">really good heuristic that it to build</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.159" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">that when in doubt become more capable</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.259" end="00:04:34.110" style="s2">of tuning your instrument in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:35.909" style="s2">relationship to the thing that is being</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.110" end="00:04:38.909" style="s2">considered because that possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.909" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">getting a massive return signal is often</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.909" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">not always often available so then to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:46.229" style="s2">make it very concrete let&#39;s talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:50.159" style="s2">subject that I imagine is present to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.229" end="00:04:55.250" style="s2">mind of many people and that is the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.159" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">problem of fake news or the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.250" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">generalized breakdown of our collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:03.419" style="s2">sense making systems so you find</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:06.060" style="s2">yourself on Facebook and you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.419" end="00:05:08.750" style="s2">yourself in a flow of information from</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.060" end="00:05:12.719" style="s2">people and what you&#39;re noticing is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.750" end="00:05:16.770" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.719" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s going on or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.770" end="00:05:22.469" style="s2">dysfunctional easy to do so what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:24.389" style="s2">by that latter part is you can&#39;t of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.469" end="00:05:26.430" style="s2">course choose to have a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.389" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">sense making framework and then smash</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.430" end="00:05:29.569" style="s2">all of reality into that sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">framework it&#39;s a very binary</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.569" end="00:05:33.029" style="s2">us-versus-them mentality and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:35.009" style="s2">everything that comes from fox news is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.029" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">true or everything that comes from CNN</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.009" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">is true and everything that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">the opposite is false and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:43.949" style="s2">what&#39;s that called externalize but grant</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:45.449" style="s2">your sense making authority to some</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.949" end="00:05:47.159" style="s2">other third party who&#39;s doing sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.449" end="00:05:49.409" style="s2">making but in the event that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.159" end="00:05:51.930" style="s2">actually want obtain your own agency and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.409" end="00:05:54.659" style="s2">make sense of what&#39;s going on what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.930" end="00:05:57.629" style="s2">would recommend is to be to consider</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.659" end="00:05:59.729" style="s2">these concepts of discernment for</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.629" end="00:06:01.979" style="s2">example to become sovereign in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.729" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">domain of sense making so when you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.979" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">about discernment in this domain what</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:08.849" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice is there a number of</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.330" end="00:12:24.050" style="s2">meaningful thing to add to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:27.740" style="s2">conversation which is a totally separate</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.050" end="00:12:30.050" style="s2">thing and notice how distinct that is</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.050" end="00:12:34.310" style="s2">news that as we build skillfulness to</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.520" end="00:12:53.780" style="s2">collaborating well now you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.500" end="00:12:55.460" style="s2">something that&#39;s real and can be can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.780" end="00:12:57.770" style="s2">things whereas if you&#39;re in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.460" end="00:13:01.970" style="s2">with somebody who either is reckless in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.770" end="00:13:03.800" style="s2">their expression or not clear in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.970" end="00:13:06.980" style="s2">listening and there&#39;s only so much you</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.800" end="00:13:08.900" style="s2">can actually do and well then you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.980" end="00:13:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like if you&#39;re parenting a</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.400" end="00:13:13.550" style="s2">throwing a tantrum there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.230" end="00:13:18.200" style="s2">things aren&#39;t working you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.910" end="00:13:20.270" style="s2">deal with the fact they&#39;re in a tantrum</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.200" end="00:13:22.340" style="s2">and so that level discernment</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.270" end="00:13:24.790" style="s2">at parenting is an example of how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.340" end="00:13:27.800" style="s2">can use this capacity for internal</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.790" end="00:13:31.280" style="s2">expressive and relational discernment in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.800" end="00:13:33.380" style="s2">the context of communication the context</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.280" end="00:13:35.180" style="s2">of sense-making as a group this is such</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.380" end="00:13:37.340" style="s2">an important thing that you&#39;re touching</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.180" end="00:13:39.620" style="s2">on here that I&#39;m not sure everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.340" end="00:13:42.370" style="s2">gonna see it but when I look at the news</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.620" end="00:13:45.290" style="s2">now and I see all this conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.370" end="00:13:46.670" style="s2">like left versus right and offense and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.290" end="00:13:48.860" style="s2">social justice war and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.670" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">stuff and I imagine you know we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.860" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">jordan peterson on before and I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:55.670" style="s2">him giving these talks all over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:57.350" style="s2">world to certain mixed audiences and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.670" end="00:13:59.480" style="s2">having people asking themselves the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.350" end="00:14:01.280" style="s2">exact question that you asked is is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.480" end="00:14:03.560" style="s2">person a member of my tribe or not and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.280" end="00:14:05.840" style="s2">just looking for those kind of key</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.560" end="00:14:07.460" style="s2">commands that it seem like he&#39;s on one</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.840" end="00:14:09.170" style="s2">side of the other instead of actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.460" end="00:14:10.460" style="s2">listening to what he&#39;s saying like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.170" end="00:14:12.650" style="s2">is such an important thing in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.460" end="00:14:14.600" style="s2">culture in our generation that I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.650" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">people are overlooking to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.600" end="00:14:19.900" style="s2">listen properly and discern for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">whether something is true or false</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.900" end="00:14:25.250" style="s2">sure yes absolutely it is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:27.710" style="s2">absurdly needful so let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.250" end="00:14:28.790" style="s2">this concept of accelerating change and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.710" end="00:14:31.550" style="s2">just think about the context of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.790" end="00:14:33.260" style="s2">listening for effectively the totality</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.550" end="00:14:35.030" style="s2">of human history which is just say from</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.260" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">the beginning of humans being humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.030" end="00:14:39.500" style="s2">until about fifteen thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:41.960" style="s2">every single being was born and raised</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.500" end="00:14:43.640" style="s2">among a group of other beings who were</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.960" end="00:14:46.460" style="s2">both genetically related to them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.640" end="00:14:47.720" style="s2">were also born and raised among a group</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.460" end="00:14:49.940" style="s2">of beings who were genetically related</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.720" end="00:14:52.340" style="s2">to them right the tribe and think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.940" end="00:14:54.440" style="s2">what that means what it means to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.340" end="00:14:58.490" style="s2">every single human being you literally</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.440" end="00:15:01.430" style="s2">have ever met is of the same tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.490" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">they have only met people who are of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.430" end="00:15:06.530" style="s2">same tribe more or less you literally</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.840" style="s2">never once sit down at a dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.530" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">with people who did not grow up with and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.840" end="00:15:13.340" style="s2">who did not grow up with each other at</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:16.850" style="s2">the level of what that means in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.340" end="00:15:19.330" style="s2">your underlying biological expectations</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.850" end="00:15:23.330" style="s2">of engaging in a conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.330" end="00:15:24.680" style="s2">comparison to now and so today as fast</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.330" end="00:15:26.650" style="s2">forward if you have history you could</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.680" end="00:15:28.910" style="s2">just kind of did the fast-forward of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.650" end="00:15:31.790" style="s2">cosmopolitanism today we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.910" end="00:15:33.170" style="s2">situation where well first and I&#39;ll like</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.790" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">with it you&#39;ve never actually even</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.170" end="00:15:36.440" style="s2">physically met the pea</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:41.660" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with and that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">heterogeneous basis of their experiences</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.660" end="00:15:47.030" style="s2">is well at the maximum that is even</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:49.610" style="s2">maybe possible to be you may not even</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.030" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">share the same well it&#39;s quite likely</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.610" end="00:15:53.270" style="s2">you do not share even vaguely the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:54.890" style="s2">culture and so right now I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.270" end="00:15:57.080" style="s2">conversation with you where are you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.890" end="00:15:59.000" style="s2">actually from I&#39;m from Russia originally</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.080" end="00:16:00.380" style="s2">mic is from Canada Canada and Russia are</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.000" end="00:16:03.170" style="s2">actually pretty good examples so as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.380" end="00:16:04.790" style="s2">Russian who speaks English very well we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.170" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">actually can have a nice relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.790" end="00:16:09.080" style="s2">knowing a kind of an intuitive level</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:11.450" style="s2">that there is going to be a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.080" end="00:16:13.670" style="s2">divide between us although by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.450" end="00:16:16.130" style="s2">think it&#39;s not as well understood how</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.670" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">distant my particular cultural lineage</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.130" end="00:16:22.040" style="s2">is from yours that the Russian culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">is actually further away from American</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:28.550" style="s2">culture than is I think conventionally</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.370" end="00:16:30.710" style="s2">grasped its origins deeper and further</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.550" end="00:16:31.970" style="s2">and then the Canadian case we actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.710" end="00:16:34.310" style="s2">have the opposite problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.970" end="00:16:36.140" style="s2">hilarious you know if I walk into China</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.310" end="00:16:38.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a really neat category that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.140" end="00:16:40.850" style="s2">exists called the obvious stranger where</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.630" end="00:16:43.430" style="s2">most of the expectations of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.850" end="00:16:45.290" style="s2">norms are put into the category of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.430" end="00:16:47.240" style="s2">stranger where nobody has an expectation</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.290" end="00:16:48.890" style="s2">that I actually know how to respond</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:51.020" style="s2">appropriately to all the various subtle</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.890" end="00:16:52.580" style="s2">signals that are going on it&#39;s funny you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.020" end="00:16:54.440" style="s2">use this example because it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.580" end="00:16:57.140" style="s2">our experience from the last seven years</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.440" end="00:16:59.090" style="s2">like this is our lives now as being the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.140" end="00:17:00.230" style="s2">stranger in an environment like that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.090" end="00:17:02.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.230" end="00:17:04.550" style="s2">times like what it&#39;s like to meet</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.810" end="00:17:05.959" style="s2">someone that you know is from the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.550" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">culture just because of their skin</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.959" end="00:17:10.189" style="s2">colour or that you know has a set of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:12.199" style="s2">similar experiences just because of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.189" end="00:17:14.030" style="s2">way they look and it&#39;s not racist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.199" end="00:17:16.430" style="s2">not assumptive it&#39;s not a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.030" end="00:17:18.500" style="s2">it&#39;s just that everyone else is Asian</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.430" end="00:17:20.900" style="s2">here except for that one other person I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.500" end="00:17:22.790" style="s2">can spot out of the crowd yeah so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.900" end="00:17:25.069" style="s2">interesting is that it&#39;s actually easier</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.790" end="00:17:27.589" style="s2">to be in relationship with somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.069" end="00:17:29.680" style="s2">is distinctly other than it is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.589" end="00:17:32.390" style="s2">relationship with somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.680" end="00:17:33.770" style="s2">superficially close you know so one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.390" end="00:17:35.720" style="s2">the experiences that particularly</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.770" end="00:17:38.780" style="s2">Americans have in going into Canada is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.720" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">that there&#39;s a bit of confusion when a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.780" end="00:17:42.230" style="s2">Canadian is communicating with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:43.910" style="s2">initially if they don&#39;t know that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.230" end="00:17:46.070" style="s2">American if they think you&#39;re Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.910" end="00:17:48.020" style="s2">they&#39;re sending signals that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.070" end="00:17:50.540" style="s2">Canadian signals des jeux d&#39;eau have</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.020" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">for and so you&#39;re not responding well</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.540" end="00:17:55.309" style="s2">they&#39;re interpreting your non-response</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">as some kind of actual response usually</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.929" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">switch and say oh it&#39;s weird like you</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.240" end="00:18:15.559" style="s2">things and now you&#39;re gonna move in to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.679" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">have a more formal dialogue we&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.590" style="s2">lower expectations and how fluidly</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.610" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">communication can happen and when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.309" end="00:18:28.490" style="s2">and so they may do something which in</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:30.770" style="s2">your culture would immediately be a sign</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.490" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">of nastiness but you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.770" end="00:18:33.500" style="s2">necessarily jump to that conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">because you&#39;re familiar with that gap</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.500" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">because we&#39;re in a situation right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:42.970" style="s2">where we&#39;re trying to build an</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.750" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">to break down why would we expect</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:19.340" style="s2">otherwise why do we expect that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:22.429" style="s2">have n the ability to communicate in</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.340" end="00:19:23.630" style="s2">those circumstances and so yes to the</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.630" end="00:19:28.340" style="s2">use this medium at all in anything other</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.059" end="00:19:31.220" style="s2">than to create conflict it is most</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.340" end="00:19:33.110" style="s2">needful that we rather substantially</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.220" end="00:19:34.850" style="s2">upgrade our capacity for communication</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.110" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">now we can return back to sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.850" end="00:19:40.070" style="s2">the primary point the deep basis for</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:41.870" style="s2">upgrading capacity is this cycle that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.070" end="00:19:43.340" style="s2">just described and it has the</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.340" end="00:19:47.179" style="s2">meaning that okay well if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.650" end="00:19:48.830" style="s2">build my skillfulness and communicating</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.179" end="00:19:50.420" style="s2">with somebody from Vietnam I could just</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.830" end="00:19:52.790" style="s2">go do a deep immersion in Vietnam and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.420" end="00:19:54.140" style="s2">kind of build a the spoke one time</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.790" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">channel that is able to take into</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.140" end="00:19:58.490" style="s2">consideration what Vietnamese people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:19:59.960" style="s2">like well okay that works that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.490" end="00:20:01.730" style="s2">happen but if I want to do it where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.960" end="00:20:03.290" style="s2">actually adaptive response</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.730" end="00:20:05.720" style="s2">to an arbitrarily large number of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.290" end="00:20:07.790" style="s2">interlocutors over an arbitrary large</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:11.780" style="s2">because they&#39;re actually changing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.610" end="00:20:13.730" style="s2">relationship to who they&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.780" end="00:20:15.320" style="s2">with that process doesn&#39;t work at all I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.730" end="00:20:17.960" style="s2">have to actually go deeper I have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.320" end="00:20:19.240" style="s2">build the sensibility of very subtle</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.960" end="00:20:21.680" style="s2">discernment and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.240" end="00:20:23.060" style="s2">everything snaps to a meta level have</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.680" end="00:20:23.810" style="s2">you heard the phrase find the others</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.060" end="00:20:25.460" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.810" end="00:20:27.110" style="s2">the meta level is when you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.460" end="00:20:29.870" style="s2">recognize individuals who&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.110" end="00:20:31.610" style="s2">developed a level of discernment of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.870" end="00:20:33.650" style="s2">kind where you&#39;re now actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.610" end="00:20:35.240" style="s2">signalling is oh we can actually engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.650" end="00:20:37.880" style="s2">in a conversation at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.240" end="00:20:39.470" style="s2">collaboration it&#39;s almost like a the way</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.470" end="00:20:43.850" style="s2">protocol works</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.220" end="00:20:44.900" style="s2">remember the Bongbong tuning in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.850" end="00:20:47.350" style="s2">beginning what happens is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.900" end="00:20:48.980" style="s2">actually sending signals that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.350" end="00:20:51.020" style="s2">ultimately really just about</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.980" end="00:20:52.610" style="s2">establishing what level of communication</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.020" end="00:20:54.560" style="s2">and collaboration is actually available</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.610" end="00:20:56.090" style="s2">in this relationship and when you find</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.560" end="00:20:57.830" style="s2">that it&#39;s a consequence those signals</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.090" end="00:20:59.240" style="s2">that you can actually enter into a truly</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.240" end="00:21:03.710" style="s2">collaborative conversation that&#39;s of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.180" end="00:21:05.780" style="s2">completely different kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.710" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">it&#39;s its own attractor that sits over</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.780" end="00:21:10.550" style="s2">here it&#39;s not the same as what happens</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:12.500" style="s2">when you&#39;re engaging in sort of trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.550" end="00:21:14.750" style="s2">to navigate the bloomin buzzing</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.500" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2">confusion of social media it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.750" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">now a completely different space that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.020" end="00:21:22.580" style="s2">can happen because the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:24.530" style="s2">capacities have been built among all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.580" end="00:21:26.540" style="s2">different participants you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.530" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">enter into a new space which we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.540" end="00:21:30.950" style="s2">just call the space of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:33.050" style="s2">which can be invariant to all possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.950" end="00:21:35.510" style="s2">media of communication because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.050" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">has taken responsibility for listening</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.510" end="00:21:40.250" style="s2">and responsibility for expressing we</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.010" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">and for noticing things for example like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">your own sovereignty does it sound like</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">this is because it makes sense to me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">out of my element and I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">little bit confused or I&#39;m physically</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:58.430" style="s2">tired and I can&#39;t actually hold was</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:22:00.410" style="s2">being presented here or that particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.430" end="00:22:03.050" style="s2">concept or phrase doesn&#39;t make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.410" end="00:22:05.240" style="s2">me can we slow down these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.050" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">things and so you could say that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.240" end="00:22:08.570" style="s2">s&#39;alright so now I&#39;m gonna have to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.370" end="00:22:10.850" style="s2">if I can put something together which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.570" end="00:22:12.440" style="s2">really nice okay so let&#39;s go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.850" end="00:22:14.030" style="s2">practical applications of this way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.440" end="00:22:15.309" style="s2">thinking what does it mean for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.030" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">future and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.309" end="00:22:19.149" style="s2">we become better at communicating and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.499" style="s2">building relationships all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.149" end="00:22:22.600" style="s2">in the beginning we were talking to our</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.499" end="00:22:24.999" style="s2">hypothetical truck driver about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.600" end="00:22:26.740" style="s2">that we had a game and they came at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.999" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">certain way of being played and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.740" end="00:22:30.070" style="s2">game was coming to an end that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:32.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work anymore and the world that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:34.539" style="s2">we live in and in point of fact if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.620" end="00:22:35.710" style="s2">look at it closely it kind of had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.539" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">come to an end because of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.710" end="00:22:39.789" style="s2">game that it was the good news is</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:40.899" style="s2">there&#39;s a new kind of game it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.789" end="00:22:42.549" style="s2">game and the sense that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.899" end="00:22:45.429" style="s2">choosing to play it but it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.549" end="00:22:48.070" style="s2">different kind of game and there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.429" end="00:22:51.009" style="s2">for you to be able to notice when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.070" end="00:22:55.899" style="s2">playing this new game and when you found</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.899" end="00:22:58.809" style="s2">this new game and are building</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.769" end="00:23:10.619" style="s2">in this new game one of the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:13.990" style="s2">shows up as the difference between</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.590" end="00:23:53.669" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t involve things like how to</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.669" end="00:23:59.350" style="s2">to confuse and we&#39;ve actually filtered</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.350" end="00:24:04.299" style="s2">once you&#39;ve done that you now have this</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.389" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">well it actually looks like a graph or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.299" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">mesh of people who are committed to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:15.850" style="s2">skillfulness of communication that has</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:36.169" style="s2">well actually it&#39;s an awful lot like</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.549" end="00:24:38.120" style="s2">what happened with the difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.169" end="00:24:39.769" style="s2">between personal computers in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.120" end="00:24:41.690" style="s2">internet you can say that we were</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.690" end="00:24:46.330" style="s2">this concept of the Internet what</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.640" end="00:24:49.429" style="s2">happens when you take things that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.330" end="00:24:51.529" style="s2">computers and you connect them so they</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.429" end="00:24:52.760" style="s2">can communicate and then you make it so</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.529" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">that they have protocols for</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.760" end="00:24:56.809" style="s2">communication so that they can all</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">communicate with each other and share</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.809" end="00:25:01.789" style="s2">information in a way that has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">fidelity to it well this has to do what</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.789" end="00:25:05.139" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about here this process of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">building a certain skillfulness in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.139" end="00:25:09.380" style="s2">communication listening and expressing</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">and informing relationships of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.380" end="00:25:13.130" style="s2">collaboration it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:16.460" style="s2">internet for human communication and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.130" end="00:25:18.789" style="s2">it&#39;s the necessary corollary to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.460" end="00:25:21.019" style="s2">Internet the physical Internet that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.789" end="00:25:22.940" style="s2">physical substrate for communication the</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.940" end="00:25:30.289" style="s2">has it&#39;s different than the medium of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">person-to-person embodied communication</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.289" end="00:25:36.049" style="s2">that we grew up in tribally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:38.269" style="s2">different than broadcast communication</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.049" end="00:25:39.500" style="s2">that has been the primary mode of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.269" end="00:25:41.450" style="s2">communication for the past millennium</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.500" end="00:25:43.250" style="s2">and so it requires a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.450" end="00:25:45.529" style="s2">skills completely different just</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.250" end="00:25:46.850" style="s2">flat-out different you can&#39;t Cluj the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.529" end="00:25:48.679" style="s2">old approach you have to build a new one</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.850" end="00:25:50.570" style="s2">and you build a new one like the way you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.679" end="00:25:53.059" style="s2">build anything new by starting at this</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.570" end="00:25:55.159" style="s2">loop from discernment to embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.059" end="00:25:58.010" style="s2">you build those raw capacities to listen</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.159" end="00:26:00.169" style="s2">and to express and then to enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.010" end="00:26:02.929" style="s2">space of collaboration and then once</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.169" end="00:26:04.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve done that well a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.929" end="00:26:09.649" style="s2">very powerful and important things</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.100" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">follow are there methods for teaching</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.649" end="00:26:15.320" style="s2">this to people effectively I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:18.679" style="s2">there are but let&#39;s say somebody hears</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.320" end="00:26:21.019" style="s2">this show and says okay I really should</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.679" end="00:26:22.730" style="s2">at understanding what is being</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.019" end="00:26:24.769" style="s2">communicated to me or I&#39;m really sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.730" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">communicating what I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.769" end="00:26:30.830" style="s2">where can I learn how to get better at</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:32.510" style="s2">this well in point of fact building that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.830" end="00:26:33.860" style="s2">is one of the things that deep code is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.510" end="00:26:35.480" style="s2">working on because it is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.860" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">things that is most needful and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.480" end="00:26:40.490" style="s2">kind of two parts to it when I sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:42.460" style="s2">there&#39;s three one is what we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.490" end="00:26:43.960" style="s2">the uplift Academy and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.460" end="00:26:45.580" style="s2">just as an example there are many many</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.960" end="00:26:47.710" style="s2">possible variations of this that many</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.580" end="00:26:49.890" style="s2">other people are doing but sukham kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.710" end="00:26:54.520" style="s2">of generalized the uplift Academy is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.890" end="00:26:58.440" style="s2">self-directed self orientation that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.520" end="00:27:01.030" style="s2">the ability to access a curated list of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.440" end="00:27:03.550" style="s2">practices that are good there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.030" end="00:27:05.380" style="s2">practices that are good and most of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.550" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">have lots of problems as well so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.380" end="00:27:09.820" style="s2">take for example what&#39;s it called</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:12.160" style="s2">landmark so landmark forum is a nice</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.820" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">good central example there are aspects</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.160" end="00:27:15.730" style="s2">of landmark that are very effective in</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2">helping an individual become more</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.730" end="00:27:22.540" style="s2">conscious of the way their own mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:23.860" style="s2">constrains the way they can think so one</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.540" end="00:27:24.490" style="s2">of the things that you might do is go to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.860" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">landmark</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.490" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">however landmark as a process grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:34.060" style="s2">the context of this old game and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:35.290" style="s2">a lot of multi-level marketing / jerking</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.060" end="00:27:38.280" style="s2">people around into spending more money</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.290" end="00:27:41.650" style="s2">that has also become part of landmark so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:43.510" style="s2">if you were to engage with that and be</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.650" end="00:27:46.870" style="s2">mindful of the parts that are good and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.510" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">be mindful the parts that aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.870" end="00:27:51.430" style="s2">said there&#39;s actually a large number of</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.289" end="00:29:54.899" style="s2">how does the sermon show up and you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.789" end="00:29:56.970" style="s2">going to be something that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.899" end="00:29:59.789" style="s2">categorically impossible for me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.970" end="00:30:02.010" style="s2">actually share your version is your</p>

<p begin="00:30:02.010" end="00:30:06.929" style="s2">try to be conscious of the process</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.470" end="00:30:09.779" style="s2">whereby you go about using discernment</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.929" end="00:30:12.210" style="s2">to actually begin to gather together the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.779" end="00:30:14.789" style="s2">sense of coherence like can you notice</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.210" end="00:30:17.130" style="s2">when you&#39;ve actually gotten better at</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.789" end="00:30:19.860" style="s2">something when you&#39;re skillfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.130" end="00:30:21.059" style="s2">increased can you generalize that can</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.860" end="00:30:23.640" style="s2">you get a sense of the difference</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.059" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">between getting better at dancing and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.640" end="00:30:29.070" style="s2">getting better at speaking French can</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.020" style="s2">you feel those things can you go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.070" end="00:30:33.029" style="s2">the specific domain to the general then</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.020" end="00:30:34.679" style="s2">all the way around the loop so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.029" end="00:30:38.789" style="s2">interesting invitation it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.679" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">invitation to learning new things but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.789" end="00:30:44.659" style="s2">principally for the purpose of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:48.029" style="s2">skillful in building in yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.659" end="00:30:50.250" style="s2">conscious awareness of what are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.029" end="00:30:52.890" style="s2">capacities that you use to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.250" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">learn new things and then you could take</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:56.039" style="s2">this and run it backwards so if I take</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:58.500" style="s2">that third part which shows up anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.039" end="00:30:59.850" style="s2">and I embed it in the first part I</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.500" end="00:31:01.470" style="s2">embedded in practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.850" end="00:31:04.470" style="s2">themselves specifically focused on</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.470" end="00:31:05.640" style="s2">building these kinds of capacities now</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.470" end="00:31:08.250" style="s2">what can happen is I can go into</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.640" end="00:31:10.200" style="s2">landmark and I can use my discernment</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.250" end="00:31:13.050" style="s2">to try to separate out that which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.200" end="00:31:15.960" style="s2">helpful and that which is not I can go</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.050" end="00:31:17.190" style="s2">into collaboration with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.960" end="00:31:19.380" style="s2">themselves and different to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.190" end="00:31:21.510" style="s2">collaborate and I can use my discernment</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.380" end="00:31:23.670" style="s2">to try to see how well we can come into</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.510" end="00:31:27.330" style="s2">a to MIT as a group you make it a meta</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.670" end="00:31:28.380" style="s2">conversation are we in coherence oh I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.330" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">just noticed that I&#39;m dropping out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:32.160" style="s2">coherence I mean it seems to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:33.720" style="s2">may be dropping out of coherence you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.160" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">know that kind of a thing so if you make</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.720" end="00:31:38.190" style="s2">it the object of consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:40.560" style="s2">you allow the other activities to become</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.190" end="00:31:42.380" style="s2">the medium of experimentation I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.560" end="00:31:46.740" style="s2">some sense that&#39;s all there is to it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.380" end="00:31:51.960" style="s2">that seems that it would require a high</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.740" end="00:31:55.800" style="s2">degree of awareness and skillfulness to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.960" end="00:32:01.640" style="s2">begin with and it seems that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.800" end="00:32:04.890" style="s2">an advanced practice in a way or maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.640" end="00:32:08.550" style="s2">know that there&#39;s I noticed myself in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.890" end="00:32:10.290" style="s2">this bias sometimes where because</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.550" end="00:32:12.570" style="s2">something is easy for me or because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.290" end="00:32:14.820" style="s2">know how to do it I assume that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.570" end="00:32:17.480" style="s2">that way for everybody else but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.820" end="00:32:21.140" style="s2">discount that you know an average person</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.480" end="00:32:23.610" style="s2">maybe you know hasn&#39;t had the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.140" end="00:32:25.500" style="s2">learning the same skills that I have and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.610" end="00:32:28.410" style="s2">for them it&#39;s just going to be a huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.500" end="00:32:31.520" style="s2">mountain to climb so this is why I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.410" end="00:32:34.980" style="s2">asking about kind of a simpler framework</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.520" end="00:32:37.350" style="s2">or a book some sort of reference where</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.980" end="00:32:40.980" style="s2">people can get started without having</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.350" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">much prior skill or awareness yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.980" end="00:32:45.750" style="s2">the answer to that is it turns out by</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:47.370" style="s2">definition no but I can explain why so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.750" end="00:32:48.990" style="s2">let&#39;s start with the I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.370" end="00:32:50.390" style="s2">funny phrase from the 60s which is no</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.990" end="00:32:53.130" style="s2">matter where you are there you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.390" end="00:32:55.650" style="s2">everybody is entering into this thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.130" end="00:32:57.150" style="s2">from where they are right now now maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.650" end="00:32:59.730" style="s2">the where you are right now happens to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.150" end="00:33:01.890" style="s2">have a lot of these capacities already</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.730" end="00:33:03.180" style="s2">well refined for whatever reason it may</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.890" end="00:33:05.490" style="s2">be that where you are right now happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.180" end="00:33:07.290" style="s2">to have these capacities very poorly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.490" end="00:33:08.700" style="s2">we&#39;re finding for whatever reason maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.290" end="00:33:10.350" style="s2">it&#39;s because you&#39;re too maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.700" end="00:33:11.970" style="s2">because you&#39;re 73 but your life has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.350" end="00:33:14.580" style="s2">one that hasn&#39;t exposed to these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.970" end="00:33:16.530" style="s2">of things it doesn&#39;t matter you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.580" end="00:33:21.049" style="s2">now with the capacities that you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.530" end="00:33:22.580" style="s2">now and the key is a sing</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.049" end="00:33:26.389" style="s2">point and that is the point of making</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.580" end="00:33:29.149" style="s2">the choice to endeavor to up gradient</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.389" end="00:33:32.869" style="s2">that&#39;s it from where you are now are you</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.149" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">making a choice to get better at these</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.869" end="00:33:36.769" style="s2">kinds of things in it where if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:39.529" style="s2">happen to be at a very low level right</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.769" end="00:33:40.909" style="s2">now here&#39;s the good news it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.529" end="00:33:43.879" style="s2">got the ability to get a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.909" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">Bella to flee quickly because you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.879" end="00:33:47.480" style="s2">a lot that you haven&#39;t learned yet of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:49.340" style="s2">course the hard part is it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.480" end="00:33:50.600" style="s2">easy to learn it it may not feel like</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.340" end="00:33:52.580" style="s2">you&#39;re making a lot of progress because</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.600" end="00:33:55.549" style="s2">you&#39;re moving from a low basis to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.580" end="00:33:57.350" style="s2">slightly less low basis so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.549" end="00:33:59.239" style="s2">like the difference between you again</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.350" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">juggling as the metaphor drives of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.239" end="00:34:05.239" style="s2">know how to juggle very poorly I also</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:07.159" style="s2">juggle very poorly like I can juggle two</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.239" end="00:34:08.299" style="s2">balls and I can juggle three balls in</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.159" end="00:34:09.319" style="s2">the way that when Joe goes two balls</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.299" end="00:34:14.510" style="s2">like there are three balls like there</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.319" end="00:34:17.149" style="s2">are two balls yes same with me well</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.510" end="00:34:19.819" style="s2">learning how to juggle is a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.149" end="00:34:22.669" style="s2">you can choose and if you choose you</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.819" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2">then begin practicing and you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.669" end="00:34:26.450" style="s2">to start with where you are and the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:30.260" style="s2">committin you have to have is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:31.339" style="s2">continue to practice and continue to try</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.260" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">to look for different ways that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.339" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">you can get better now here from this</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">point you can say okay I&#39;m gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">for a book or a video or a teacher or a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:41.540" style="s2">community or a club now of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.940" style="s2">gonna be depend on you you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.540" end="00:34:45.619" style="s2">actually do that if I say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.940" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">book it turns out book isn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.619" end="00:34:50.540" style="s2">you I&#39;ve actually hurt you significantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:53.059" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually overridden your own agency</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.540" end="00:34:54.889" style="s2">without a deep sense now maybe that as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.059" end="00:34:57.170" style="s2">teacher if I enter into relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.889" end="00:34:59.480" style="s2">with you I could develop a very high</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.170" end="00:35:01.700" style="s2">degree of insight into you and I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.480" end="00:35:04.520" style="s2">gently guide you into more effective</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.700" end="00:35:05.869" style="s2">choices but then again maybe you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.520" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">very good at entering into relationships</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.869" end="00:35:08.599" style="s2">with teachers maybe you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:10.130" style="s2">relationship with authority that would</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.599" end="00:35:12.970" style="s2">make my recommendations point you in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.130" end="00:35:15.559" style="s2">opposite direction so it&#39;s gonna be you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.970" end="00:35:18.410" style="s2">sorry everybody has to figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.559" end="00:35:19.309" style="s2">for themselves what we can do is we</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.410" end="00:35:21.799" style="s2">could try to get out of other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.309" end="00:35:24.290" style="s2">way and we could try to make ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.799" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">capable of entering into relationships</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.290" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">with other people that are more likely</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:32.200" style="s2">than not to generate positive effects</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:33.950" style="s2">with Spinoza called joyful relations</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.200" end="00:35:37.430" style="s2">meaning I</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.950" end="00:35:40.250" style="s2">going to express to you in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.430" end="00:35:42.710" style="s2">I can just kind of ordinary ways I kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.250" end="00:35:45.619" style="s2">of try to be to deliberate I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.710" end="00:35:47.750" style="s2">gonna try to be authentically expressing</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.619" end="00:35:50.329" style="s2">these things and what happens as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.750" end="00:35:52.760" style="s2">result is that perhaps you notice</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.329" end="00:35:55.130" style="s2">something or you feel something or</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.760" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">something connects for you and in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.130" end="00:36:02.930" style="s2">relationship maybe something for you has</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">upgraded and if I at least am NOT making</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.930" end="00:36:07.700" style="s2">noise if I at least I&#39;m doing my best to</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:10.820" style="s2">provide as much signal as I can and</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.270" end="00:40:36.710" style="s2">music I&#39;m gonna propose that you learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.760" end="00:40:38.350" style="s2">how to play guitar but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.710" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">propose it in a way that is going to be</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:46.180" style="s2">everybody&#39;s experience of that take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:49.880" style="s2">guitar or any other kind of device and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.180" end="00:40:54.080" style="s2">do exactly and nothing but this pluck</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.880" end="00:40:57.350" style="s2">one string and listen to it try to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.080" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">how carefully you can sense the sound</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.350" end="00:41:02.870" style="s2">that it makes the difference between the</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.870" end="00:41:08.570" style="s2">strength of the sound how it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.180" end="00:41:11.380" style="s2">quieter over time literally just do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.570" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">and maybe maybe if you feel up to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.380" end="00:41:16.700" style="s2">consider plucking another string and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:19.370" style="s2">seeing if you can notice the difference</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.700" end="00:41:21.590" style="s2">between the two that&#39;s discernment that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.370" end="00:41:23.540" style="s2">is the discernment in its Raw&#39;s deepest</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.590" end="00:41:26.420" style="s2">sense and don&#39;t do anything more than</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.540" end="00:41:27.710" style="s2">that that&#39;s humility don&#39;t try to rush</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.420" end="00:41:30.650" style="s2">into something don&#39;t try to suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.710" end="00:41:31.820" style="s2">become be playing free bird or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.650" end="00:41:34.220" style="s2">stairway to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.820" end="00:41:36.890" style="s2">just learn how to listen to the sound of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.220" end="00:41:40.310" style="s2">a single note being plucked and die and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.890" end="00:41:42.680" style="s2">maybe also if you can see if you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.310" end="00:41:45.590" style="s2">relate to that as the story of all lives</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.680" end="00:41:46.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s the sacred so there you go</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.590" end="00:41:49.430" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.900" end="00:41:51.620" style="s2">effectively everybody everywhere has the</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.620" end="00:42:02.300" style="s2">needful is good friends but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.750" end="00:42:03.890" style="s2">sometimes hard to know what a good</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.870" end="00:42:09.710" style="s2">that if you sort of had to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.120" end="00:42:11.480" style="s2">next thing above your own body being</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.710" end="00:42:12.740" style="s2">able to be a friend with yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.480" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">being able to be friends with other</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.740" end="00:42:17.770" style="s2">people if you get a crew of</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.470" end="00:42:27.400" style="s2">from that basis you can do anything I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.150" end="00:42:29.140" style="s2">think we have to wrap up it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.400" end="00:42:31.089" style="s2">it&#39;s wrapping up on his own anything you</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.140" end="00:42:32.290" style="s2">guys want to close with well I think the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.089" end="00:42:35.020" style="s2">thing that feels to me like it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.290" end="00:42:38.589" style="s2">wants to be said is just to remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.020" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">that kind of all in the same boat</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.589" end="00:42:44.230" style="s2">that almost nobody and myself very much</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:48.339" style="s2">included has any meaningful skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.230" end="00:42:50.650" style="s2">in this new game Daniel the Dalai Lama</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.339" end="00:42:51.940" style="s2">fill in the blanks and by the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.650" end="00:42:53.349" style="s2">not trying to draw a comparison between</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.940" end="00:42:54.940" style="s2">among us I&#39;m trying to as I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.349" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">about as like I will who might somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.940" end="00:43:00.010" style="s2">imagine is way way serious awesome and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:01.510" style="s2">to be sure the Dalai Lama has got some</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.010" end="00:43:04.750" style="s2">mad skills when it comes to certain</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.510" end="00:43:06.970" style="s2">things but this is a big game we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.750" end="00:43:08.410" style="s2">of all at level one we&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.970" end="00:43:10.510" style="s2">beginning to try to figure how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.410" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">I can tell you that I don&#39;t have many</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.510" end="00:43:14.260" style="s2">friends and I&#39;m not very good at being a</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:16.810" style="s2">friend in the context of what this thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.260" end="00:43:19.000" style="s2">is about and so I think that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.810" end="00:43:22.089" style="s2">bit heartening is to know that no matter</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.000" end="00:43:25.089" style="s2">where you are almost everybody else is</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.089" end="00:43:26.589" style="s2">more or less in the same place and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.089" end="00:43:29.319" style="s2">kind of trying to figure this out I</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.589" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">found one of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.319" end="00:43:32.770" style="s2">stories that we talked about from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:36.069" style="s2">last time or the first time we talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.770" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">was the conversation about your daughter</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.069" end="00:43:40.599" style="s2">and your observation of your daughter</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:42.339" style="s2">playing Minecraft and having this sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.599" end="00:43:46.359" style="s2">of like swarm intelligence with her</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.339" end="00:43:49.060" style="s2">friends and that has become like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.359" end="00:43:51.430" style="s2">the most interesting thing for me to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.060" end="00:43:53.560" style="s2">like ask you about is your how these</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.430" end="00:43:55.780" style="s2">things apply in your context of raising</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.560" end="00:43:58.359" style="s2">a child watching something come from</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.780" end="00:44:00.190" style="s2">nothing to functioning human being and</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.359" end="00:44:02.920" style="s2">what it must be like to be a kid of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.190" end="00:44:04.780" style="s2">yours with such a deep understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.920" end="00:44:06.339" style="s2">how people learn and in deep code and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.780" end="00:44:08.920" style="s2">everything like like what kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.339" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">you would in part to a child well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.920" end="00:44:12.130" style="s2">not gonna be very much different for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:13.150" style="s2">conversation we just had which by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.130" end="00:44:16.060" style="s2">way is one of the reasons why I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.150" end="00:44:18.430" style="s2">difficulty doing the e Li 5 because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.060" end="00:44:20.020" style="s2">actually tend to communicate with 5th</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.430" end="00:44:21.579" style="s2">graders or five-year-olds like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.020" end="00:44:23.079" style="s2">communicate with everybody else and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.579" end="00:44:25.390" style="s2">turns out that works out fine I</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.079" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">appreciate that I appreciate when people</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.390" end="00:44:30.280" style="s2">talk to kids like adults expect</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">behavior of children that&#39;s it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.280" end="00:44:32.860" style="s2">and they like it too of course they like</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:34.450" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.860" end="00:44:35.650" style="s2">absolutely and because they would they</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.450" end="00:44:37.630" style="s2">feel as they feel that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.650" end="00:44:40.060" style="s2">respecting them and your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.630" end="00:44:41.800" style="s2">with them as a person and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.060" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">probably by the way that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.800" end="00:44:48.460" style="s2">central the central is to convey in</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:52.420" style="s2">indeed in actual act that you fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.460" end="00:44:56.910" style="s2">recognize that as a parent you are in</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.420" end="00:45:01.270" style="s2">relationship with a soul that is as</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.910" end="00:45:03.190" style="s2">sovereign as yours that while you may</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.270" end="00:45:06.130" style="s2">have a particular relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.190" end="00:45:07.600" style="s2">service to Stuart a body that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.130" end="00:45:09.610" style="s2">process of learning how to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.600" end="00:45:11.320" style="s2">world the much more important</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.610" end="00:45:13.030" style="s2">relationship is the relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.320" end="00:45:15.670" style="s2">the soul and that soul is as fully</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.030" end="00:45:22.600" style="s2">realized as profound and as sovereign as</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.670" end="00:45:25.300" style="s2">yours and so to act on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.600" end="00:45:30.010" style="s2">understanding and of course being able</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.300" end="00:45:32.740" style="s2">to do that is no joke and I can assure</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.010" end="00:45:35.740" style="s2">you that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I certainly did</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.740" end="00:45:37.570" style="s2">not have the level of artfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.740" end="00:45:39.850" style="s2">parenting that I would have liked</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.570" end="00:45:43.110" style="s2">however your daughter might listen to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.850" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">this and be like dad you&#39;re full of</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.110" end="00:45:50.770" style="s2">but why did you grab me the other day</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:52.530" style="s2">then Vanessa is pregnant so we will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.770" end="00:45:54.900" style="s2">going through this process again and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.530" end="00:45:57.310" style="s2">that was actually done intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.900" end="00:46:00.910" style="s2">obviously well not not obviously but in</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.310" end="00:46:03.790" style="s2">this case quite intentionally we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.910" end="00:46:08.680" style="s2">distinctly having skin in the game in</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.790" end="00:46:10.030" style="s2">this future world and and in this way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.680" end="00:46:13.860" style="s2">being in relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.030" end="00:46:17.980" style="s2">and with a being who we have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.860" end="00:46:19.450" style="s2">kind of responsibility for and parenting</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.980" end="00:46:21.100" style="s2">is actually precisely the right metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.450" end="00:46:23.500" style="s2">you could actually say that if you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.100" end="00:46:25.900" style="s2">reduce all of this to parenting how do</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.500" end="00:46:27.700" style="s2">you parent yourself how do you entrance</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.900" end="00:46:29.620" style="s2">relationships of parenting with other</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.700" end="00:46:30.850" style="s2">people and by the way how do you enter</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.620" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">into relationships of parenting with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.850" end="00:46:37.090" style="s2">world but recognizing the parenting</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:38.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t authoritarianism if you can really</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.090" end="00:46:40.360" style="s2">get to the essence that what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.530" end="00:46:41.560" style="s2">apply these concepts of discernment for</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.360" end="00:46:45.910" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.560" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">to make exquisite choices under duress</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.910" end="00:46:50.140" style="s2">and where you have amazing intense</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:52.090" style="s2">uncertainty is what the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.140" end="00:46:54.910" style="s2">might be like that&#39;s what parenting</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.090" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">really is every choice you make as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.910" end="00:47:00.280" style="s2">parent is fundamental to the development</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:03.580" style="s2">of the child every choice every</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.280" end="00:47:07.510" style="s2">expression every tone of voice deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:09.100" style="s2">deep and so the stakes are high and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.510" end="00:47:11.560" style="s2">to the degree to which you actually have</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.100" end="00:47:13.510" style="s2">this internal discernment this ability</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.560" end="00:47:15.790" style="s2">to listen to what at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.510" end="00:47:17.590" style="s2">calling for and then to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.790" end="00:47:21.340" style="s2">an exquisite choice in response to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.590" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">is that its most stark its most intense</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.340" end="00:47:31.510" style="s2">so I saw a post somebody who asked the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">question what are the most unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.510" end="00:47:36.210" style="s2">things they learned from being a parent</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:39.310" style="s2">and one of the things they said was that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.210" end="00:47:42.340" style="s2">suddenly everything matters and nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.310" end="00:47:46.120" style="s2">becomes impossible like air every</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.340" end="00:47:49.230" style="s2">tiniest thing matters and thus if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.120" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">relate to the world in a similar way</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.230" end="00:47:53.980" style="s2">how would that actually change</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:56.920" style="s2">everything because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.980" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">nihilism today in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.920" end="00:48:01.120" style="s2">disconnectedness in all of this these</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.740" style="s2">ways that we&#39;re relating to things or</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.120" end="00:48:06.070" style="s2">where things are happening so far away</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.740" end="00:48:08.920" style="s2">from us that we can&#39;t possibly see how</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.070" end="00:48:11.770" style="s2">it affects anything and it&#39;s easy to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.920" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">very nihilistic but we can&#39;t be because</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.770" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">everything is connected in such a deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:21.160" style="s2">way and our world is at a point right</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:24.790" style="s2">now where if we don&#39;t observe all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.160" end="00:48:27.910" style="s2">those connections we might well it all</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.790" end="00:48:29.560" style="s2">might end I mean the existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.910" end="00:48:32.020" style="s2">are real don&#39;t you think it all comes</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.560" end="00:48:33.250" style="s2">back to responsibility okay in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.020" end="00:48:35.890" style="s2">situation of being a parent you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.250" end="00:48:38.020" style="s2">forced to have the responsibility but we</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.890" end="00:48:40.180" style="s2">don&#39;t take that same responsibility when</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.020" end="00:48:43.360" style="s2">we look at the rest of the world just in</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.180" end="00:48:45.160" style="s2">our small little environment this this</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.360" end="00:48:46.180" style="s2">folks with made a play on words but</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.160" end="00:48:48.700" style="s2">they&#39;ve transformed the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.180" end="00:48:51.610" style="s2">responsibility to the ability to respond</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.700" end="00:48:53.290" style="s2">and if you make that transformation I</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.610" end="00:48:55.310" style="s2">think the answer is right and and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.290" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">think that the parenting</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.310" end="00:48:59.270" style="s2">if you put parenting in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.230" end="00:49:01.430" style="s2">this notion of taking responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.270" end="00:49:04.790" style="s2">the whole world it actually provides a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.430" end="00:49:07.240" style="s2">very nice comparison and what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.790" end="00:49:09.800" style="s2">this parenting is overwhelming you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.240" end="00:49:11.420" style="s2">actually for sure cannot take</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.800" end="00:49:12.920" style="s2">comprehensive responsibility at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.420" end="00:49:15.230" style="s2">level of the responsibility that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.920" end="00:49:17.390" style="s2">have as a parent no human being has ever</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.230" end="00:49:20.090" style="s2">been able to actually have that level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.390" end="00:49:21.740" style="s2">capacity to be able to do that so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.090" end="00:49:24.490" style="s2">that means is that you have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.740" end="00:49:27.530" style="s2">to make to do two things simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.490" end="00:49:30.740" style="s2">you have to have an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.530" end="00:49:35.240" style="s2">humility and self compassion for your</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.740" end="00:49:38.420" style="s2">own inadequacy and then you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.240" end="00:49:41.240" style="s2">a commitment to continuing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.420" end="00:49:43.820" style="s2">best you can to be adequate to the thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.240" end="00:49:46.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re responsible for and both</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.820" end="00:49:47.450" style="s2">have to happen simultaneously well the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.280" end="00:49:49.220" style="s2">same thing is true in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.450" end="00:49:51.500" style="s2">the world you have to have an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.220" end="00:49:53.540" style="s2">amount of humility and self compassion</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.500" end="00:49:55.370" style="s2">in relationship to your own inadequacy</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.540" end="00:49:56.920" style="s2">in the context of the world for which we</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.370" end="00:50:00.440" style="s2">are all collectively responsible and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.920" end="00:50:01.820" style="s2">then simultaneously you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.440" end="00:50:04.190" style="s2">complete commitment to doing the best</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.820" end="00:50:06.170" style="s2">you can to becoming adequate to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.190" end="00:50:08.860" style="s2">level responsibility so well then</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.170" end="00:50:08.860" style="s2">perhaps we should end here</p>
