<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">they thought that the stoa was a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.280" end="00:00:49.840" style="s2">good example of something</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">uh called the merasenga and he meant it</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.840" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">in more</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">and non-badus uh like buddhistic terms</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">sort of like a space that can house a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2">uh wisdom and spiritual traditions that</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">um yeah i thought the meta song is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">really interesting idea but i thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:35.879" style="s2">you know it would just end up being kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">of an abstract conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.879" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">meta-systematic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">you know like community and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">really have a bunch to say about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">to be honest still trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">build these spaces and so i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">much to say on them because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem clear to me exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">to do that um but i think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">pieces that might be helpful or</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">one piece uh that i could imagine being</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">in creating spaces where people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">practicing across</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">different traditional contexts is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">interpersonal practices available in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">practices that we can do together</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">and of course social meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">nothing new</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">since people have been meditating which</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">is probably since people</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">since human beings were uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:24.879" style="s2">we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve been contemplating meditating</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">um you can look back at the history of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">indict traditions and see these</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">incredible examples of social</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">chanting you know of everyone chanting</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">over and over again out loud together</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">and getting into this deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">collective flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">or trance and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really only been in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">last couple hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">uh with with with the advent of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">that it seems like meditation has become</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:57.599" style="s2">something new or different the way we</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">kind of currently understand it</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">and that is as a solo kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">self-improvement project</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">you know meditation something we do to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">improve ourselves or develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">our capacities or you know become better</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">at not reacting</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">to our you know impulses or uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of vision of modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">meditation uh everyone can be their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">you know and everyone can can follow</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">their own path</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">and and i think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">beautiful about that but i</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">and i practice in that context um quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">a bit that&#39;s where i</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">began but i also found it quite also</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">limiting</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">to be focused primarily on my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">all the time and so when i</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">first encountered uh the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">social meditation about 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">um from one of my own teachers</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">uh it was like a revel it was a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">revelation um to me because i&#39;d spent</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">about a year or so up to that point on</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">silent retreat</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">uh in my 20s i spent a year in total not</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">all at once</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">in silence meditating for 10 to 12 hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">a day</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">and that was a great experience except</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">that meditation and ex</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">it became this thing that like it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">only happening in my inner world and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">i could find some people who i could</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">talk to about it which were rare</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">um you know then we could have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">esoteric conversation about our weird</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">uh and and that was great but but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">felt like something that was very</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">isolated from</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">others from other people from the rest</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">of the world it felt like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">that just existed in my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">and so to do to actually verbalize and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">to meditate out loud with another person</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">it just made me realize of course it</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be that way</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">we could actually meditate together uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">again uh and and maybe we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">a new way we&#39;re not all just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">to to become</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:04.960" style="s2">one with the same mantra you know what</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">what if instead there was a way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.960" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">the diversity of experience that can</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">arise</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">uh in in in our collective experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">um and and and and yet not all just be</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">experiencing that diversity internally</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">while we sit together in silence</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">so for me social meditation is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">practice of bringing meditation</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">out of just one&#39;s inner experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">a collective process of investigation</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">listening curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">so um so i&#39;d like today to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">couple of social meditation</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">practices for for this group</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">with this group and these are very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">practices so if you if you find them</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">helpful and you want to share them</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">you can one because they&#39;re open source</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">and two because</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">uh you know anyone can facilitate these</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">these practices that the instructions</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">are quite simple</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">um uh actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">doing them is the challenging part</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">so uh today i wanted to offer a couple</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">of social meditation practice and to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">do the practices together maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">five or ten minute</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">period of practice and then to open up</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">after each of these practices</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">and just check in and say hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">how was that for you what did you notice</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">uh were there any questions that came up</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">for you any insights that you had any</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">challenges</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">that occurred so there&#39;ll just be an</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">open space</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">for discussion after we do each</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">of these two techniques that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">like to propose</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">for our time today</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">the two techniques uh that i have in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">mind one is um just a simple mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">practice and it comes out of a technique</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">called social</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">noting and in noting meditation</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">traditionally this is a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">traditionally one would sit eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">by oneself</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">and to internally note or label what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">arising moment to moment to give a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">one or two word label um</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">to identify okay this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">and in the practice of social noting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">only difference is we</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">do it out loud with other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s the big that&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">innovation</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">um and it&#39;s surprising surprisingly not</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">more people have thought of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">uh and yet when we do that my experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">after having done the noting</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">practice internally for i don&#39;t know 3</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">000 or so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">hours i started to do it out loud and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">found wow this is a different practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">it both is and isn&#39;t a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">practice it&#39;s different because</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">now i&#39;m able to hear other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">experience what</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">they&#39;re experiencing and not only that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">i can model my experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">and and if you&#39;re able to meditate with</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">someone out loud</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">who has a few thousand hours of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">experience under their belt</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly helpful to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">how they actually practice you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">they actually experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">uh which is by the way no different than</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">what what each of us experiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">um and uh and and sometimes it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s just having someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.279" style="s2">acknowledge oh there&#39;s anger</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">there&#39;s frustration there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.279" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">self-aggrandizing thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">oh okay yeah just like me you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">maybe i could</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">actually let this anger or let this</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">self-referential thinking maybe i could</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">actually notice that it&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">and acknowledge that this is true for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">um and and i think that&#39;s the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">social meditation</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">um you know we can we can see each</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">other&#39;s humanity</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">so the first practice i&#39;d like to offer</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">is a it&#39;s a mindfulness-based practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">in which we will just moment-to-moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.279" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">uh be noticing what we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">and the form of that of this practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">is called there is noting</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">there is noting</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">this technique was developed by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">teacher that i mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">uh kenneth falk who um had the bright</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">idea of doing these practices out loud</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">with other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">and the reason he did that actually was</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">he decided that the traditional method</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">of teaching</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">vapasana or mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">this noting practice in particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t work that well so traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">you&#39;d go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">mostly you&#39;d go to a monk uh and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">monk would give you the instructions</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">and then you go off and you practice the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">instructions by yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">and then at some point in the future</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">whether it&#39;s an hour or a day or a week</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">or month</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">or even longer you&#39;d come back and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">report</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">on your first person experience you say</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">okay when i did that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">this is what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">then the monk would hear you you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">left for a lot of my teachers that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">they&#39;d be working with an asian monk</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">so then they&#39;d have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">translation challenges between english</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">and um in this case bernice and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">then the teacher would offer them</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">feedback and instructions okay do this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">try this modify this and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">with that is there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">in this in this way of learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">meditation where we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">um not understand each other where</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">of miscommunication and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">such a huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">long time between the initial receiving</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">of the instructions and getting feedback</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">so the learning loop the feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">of how quickly we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">understand put into practice and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">refine our technique</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">is extraordinarily long and what what</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">kenneth discovered is if you just do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">out loud with another person</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">and you just take turns for instance</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">going back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">noting out loud what you&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing there&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">there&#39;s dryness there is investigating</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.320" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">there&#39;s nervousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">there&#39;s allowing there&#39;s uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">there&#39;s breathing</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">if you do that then very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">you can sort of see oh okay this is how</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">the practice works</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:59.519" style="s2">oh okay got it ah okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">the thing that you just noted there um</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">of a thought than it is a sensation</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">there is a fan moving above in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">ceiling it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">actually no there&#39;s just they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">you can actually make that more simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">so you can offer feedback and you kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">of very quickly refine the technique so</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">this practice arose as as as an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">to improve the pedagogy of teaching</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">and then the side effect is that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">interpersonal intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">so in this practice the instructions are</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna break out into small groups</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">of say three to four people each</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna have about 10 minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">just take turns</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">noting our experience as it&#39;s arising</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">saying there is and then using a word or</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:51.920" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">to describe what your current experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">and this is your current sensory</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">experience you know what are you sensing</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">right now what are you seeing hearing</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">smelling tasting touching</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">feeling thinking feel free to use any</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">words you like that help describe</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">that experience in this practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">so there&#39;s a creative component to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">sometimes we call this freestyle noting</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">whatever you want to know is okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">whatever words you want to use to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">describe your experience are fine</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">um and then the other important thing i</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">want to say about social meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">also okay to not participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">verbal</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">out loud component um because</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">as i&#39;m sure some of you have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">you know social anxiety is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s not appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">perhaps to open up and share</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">our experience maybe we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">you know ease our way into to that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">of level of vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">my wife often says trust is earned you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">know so if you don&#39;t want to just come</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">blazing into just open sharing what</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">you&#39;re also very welcome to participate</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">in this practice as a witness</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">so you can take the role of witness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">just silently observing</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">and participating through that silent</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">so know that that&#39;s also an option in</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">this practice</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">and i&#39;ll probably ask if anyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">wants to do that beforehand so we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">just identify</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">and we can know who&#39;s witnessing so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">don&#39;t kind of expect each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">to be doing something we&#39;re not social</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">expectations</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">yeah a big part of social meditation</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">so let me stop here um are there any</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">questions so far</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">by other people&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">there is uh sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">large upswellings of energy like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">if one of us went out of turn or</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">if somebody said something that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">was funny or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">all of a sudden the energy would arise</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">and then it would settle down</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">and that was a fairly common occurrence</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">throughout the course of the 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">right awesome i&#39;m a long time</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.120" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s really basic but it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">entertaining and instructive</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">just to see things change things shift</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">context for other people but then also</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not the practice like if i</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">was doing this on my own i probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">would just say you know there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">smelling</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">and then what i&#39;m saying to people i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">like well they&#39;re going to want to know</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe vegetables they&#39;re smelling</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">maybe cooking vegetables or something</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">yeah like because but that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">also like simply somehow but i noticed</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">i i was doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">um i mean it sounds to me like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the social conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">you know that that we all uh carry um</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">smelling like that could be i could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">smelling my own farts right you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">people to think you&#39;re you&#39;re over here</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">smelling your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">your own body odor so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">so i mean that could be one reason to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">want context</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:56.400" style="s2">see makes sense but this practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give you that</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.400" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t afford that so instead we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">seeing car conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">i seldom smell myself until i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">far down</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">smart going yeah good point yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">it has to be pretty intense</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">all right well um thank you all for for</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">trying this practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">um i wanted to to maybe do one more</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">uh and have a chance to check in about</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">um so this next practice we did a sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">practice to begin with and here i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">to offer</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">a heartfulness practice to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">incline the mind toward opening the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">heart so</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">that&#39;s to me the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">heartfulness it doesn&#39;t mean we will</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">experience an open heart it just means</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re pointing uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">our intention uh the gps of our heart in</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">that direction</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">so um here uh the next practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">um this this practice is very simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">it&#39;s called spontaneous thanks</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">and in this practice the instructions</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">are in your small group</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.039" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">whenever you feel moved this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">spontaneous part</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">feel free to say out loud thank you</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s the practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.039" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">um are there any questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">everybody is saying thank you but</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">uh yes uh when you feel moved as you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">feel moved to say it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">so this is kind of like a you could say</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">this is a gratitude practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">if you like it&#39;s focused on on</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.840" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">developing gratefulness</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">it&#39;s even a devotional practice if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">orient in that in that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">it can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">any other questions</p>
