<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:54.678" style="s2">We&#39;re going to start conversing as a consequence. So thanks a lot for making the time to talk with me</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:01:57.259" style="s2">Thank you for the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:01.459" style="s2">So, why don&#39;t we start with with your book and your tour</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:05.179" style="s2">Yeah, well, it&#39;s the book came out</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.530" style="s2">Actually just a month after I was diagnosed with cancer. So</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.380" end="00:02:14.449" style="s2">The it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s Bennett last year a lot of highs and lows like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:18.200" style="s2">The highs have been incredible because I&#39;ve had the privilege of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.200" end="00:02:22.280" style="s2">Like you being able to go around and speak to people about my book and my ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.010" end="00:02:29.660" style="s2">Certainly, not as large audiences as you have but you know been able to go to places in the country that I think young men</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:36.110" style="s2">need to hear stories of self empowerment and what individual agency can accomplish and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.390" style="s2">shared though that that experience with in in areas where I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.009" style="s2">You know books are often not seen as relevant to the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:53.420" style="s2">everyday people I think I&#39;ve been able to learn a lot about the disconnect between the literary industry and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:02:56.929" style="s2">Everyday Canadians and I think that&#39;s true in other countries as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:04.100" style="s2">sometimes aren&#39;t written for an audience of people who might most benefit from those ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:07.759" style="s2">I feel very privileged today and we&#39;ll go around and talk to people about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.880" end="00:03:11.630" style="s2">the struggles young men face the tools that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:16.549" style="s2">are often given to them in terms of how to overcome those struggles and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.769" end="00:03:22.669" style="s2">Also the tools they find in the absence of better options. Do you have a copy of your book just behind you?</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.670" end="00:03:25.880" style="s2">You should maybe hold it up so that we could all see it. Yeah. Yeah, let&#39;s take a look</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.269" end="00:03:31.879" style="s2">Yeah, so here&#39;s the book. The the US Edition will have a similar cover and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s been it&#39;s been it&#39;s been a heck of an experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:42.500" style="s2">you know, I think there&#39;s something very humbling about people caring what you think about anything quite honestly, so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:47.419" style="s2">And there&#39;s a there&#39;s a responsibility that comes with to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:55.189" style="s2">the opportunity of an audience and do something meaningful with it, and I&#39;ve tried my best to do that with the book and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:59.030" style="s2">Excited to do that in other countries next year as well. So</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:06.709" style="s2">You said something interesting about books and it&#39;s something worth delving into a bit, you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.709" end="00:04:10.878" style="s2">the number of people the proportion of people who buy books is relatively small and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.610" end="00:04:13.610" style="s2">It&#39;s not like books are everybody&#39;s friend</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.200" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">The act of literate audience is actually a rather small minority of people and one of the things that&#39;s quite cool about YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:27.089" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and also about podcasts is that it enables people who might be intimidated by books</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:31.320" style="s2">But who are perfectly capable of understanding relatively complex ideas to?</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:37.529" style="s2">Access them another way and it is really too bad. That reading is a minority taste because</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:43.049" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s such an effective means of communication. But at least these other channels have been opening up. I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.770" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">Agree and I think perhaps most effectively books are a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.640" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">conversation starter</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:55.049" style="s2">You know the idea of putting ideas out there and then being able to go to a city you&#39;ve never been before and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.270" end="00:04:56.440" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:03.119" style="s2">Starting point in which they can engage you and talk about their lives and your life and what&#39;s similar and what&#39;s different? That&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">Maybe the most powerful part of a book to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:11.129" style="s2">I actually think a lot about it in the sense of you know, the most read book for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:17.159" style="s2">like the Bible and texts like that, which I think their greatest power is in trying to offer some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.890" end="00:05:21.719" style="s2">shared kind of moral universe for people of different backgrounds and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:27.809" style="s2">Ancestors and in different parts of the world to kind of come under write and I feel like with a book you have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.540" end="00:05:34.859" style="s2">Ability, I hope which is to tell a story where you have no real say or power and who picks it up</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.990" end="00:05:36.990" style="s2">but you hope that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.390" end="00:05:44.039" style="s2">Powerful enough and truthful enough that whoever picks it up is going to feel like they&#39;re part of that that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.040" end="00:05:44.470" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.470" end="00:05:50.609" style="s2">Maybe you could outline for us the main points of your book and also talk about how it grew out of your experience being part</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.610" end="00:05:54.930" style="s2">Of what&#39;s really quite remarkable about your biography is the apparent</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:57.839" style="s2">disjuncture between your status</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:03.959" style="s2">Hypothetically as illiterate at age 16 and then no a very high academic achiever by the age of 18</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:06.540" style="s2">It&#39;s like so I&#39;m curious about the interplay</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.540" end="00:06:11.790" style="s2">I&#39;m curious about that period about how that happened and and and and what it Manton but then also about</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.010" end="00:06:15.689" style="s2">The journey that you took so to speak on the road to writing this book</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">yeah when I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.479" end="00:06:25.149" style="s2">16 I I would maybe describe myself as someone who was the the depths of despair, right?</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:29.470" style="s2">I was a really angry person. My father had left my family</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.470" end="00:06:33.610" style="s2">My mom was raising me and two younger sisters by herself</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.610" end="00:06:39.819" style="s2">I was in a neighborhood where I saw what I regarded as a lot of unfairness</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:43.090" style="s2">You know things like racial profiling by police officers</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.480" end="00:06:50.469" style="s2">Disproportionate poverty a lack of job opportunities. This is in the suburbs of Brampton where most of the people in my neighborhood were</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.020" end="00:06:53.529" style="s2">newcomers to the country or children of newcomers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.140" end="00:07:00.069" style="s2">I was kind of I think being weighed down by a perspective that encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:06.670" style="s2">Hopelessness and victimization in my life. So I was a cognitively capable young man</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">that&#39;s how you go from, you know illiterate to a Yale Law student in less than six years, but</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.990" end="00:07:20.650" style="s2">What was was missing was the desire to show that that those good parts of me to anyone?</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.650" end="00:07:23.739" style="s2">So what do you taking was? What do you think? It was exactly that?</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.650" end="00:07:26.330" style="s2">produced that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.330" end="00:07:27.890" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.890" end="00:07:31.539" style="s2">Despair despair that possessed you when you were 16</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.540" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">I mean you you outlined some of it, you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:38.049" style="s2">You lived in a neighborhood that was well an immigrant neighborhood and and and you saw</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:41.109" style="s2">What you regarded as Manifest social unfairness?</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.330" end="00:07:48.999" style="s2">but then it&#39;s obviously the case too that for some reason when you decided to I don&#39;t know if you dropped that idea or</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.340" end="00:07:49.960" style="s2">Transcended it</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.960" end="00:07:55.659" style="s2">You did something different and all of a sudden your life took off in in a variety of extremely positive directions</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.660" end="00:08:01.989" style="s2">Like, how do you how do you account for that initial possession by that set of ideas and then more importantly?</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.990" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">How do you account for the fact that you somehow managed to let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.380" end="00:08:08.150" style="s2">Escape it</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.150" end="00:08:11.079" style="s2">Hmm. So for my situation</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.080" end="00:08:14.619" style="s2">I think this describes out of my peer group as well not having a father around</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.870" end="00:08:18.250" style="s2">And and the kind of dysfunction that that often comes with</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:24.610" style="s2">put us in a position where we were looking at a lot of the wrong places for cultural leadership and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.310" end="00:08:30.730" style="s2">Pop culture right hip hop gangster movies things like that filled the void in our case</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.220" end="00:08:35.469" style="s2">So the tools I was given to understand my life, too</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.210" end="00:08:43.669" style="s2">Explain my frustrations were tools that encouraged me to I think live in us with a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:52.309" style="s2">Victim identity as my default right that I could for example lit</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:57.560" style="s2">Believe that being a gangster and a criminal was acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.290" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">for me and my peers because we</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.130" end="00:09:07.309" style="s2">Experienced unfairness, right the way the world treated us determine the kind of morals that we picked up, right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.310" end="00:09:14.030" style="s2">so it&#39;s justifiable revenge in some sense against an entire system, right or at minimum it winds up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:18.499" style="s2">Just you lower the expectations of yourself, right you walk around thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.140" end="00:09:25.759" style="s2">What you know to be good is something that you don&#39;t have to achieve you don&#39;t have to strive for goodness</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.130" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">Because the world has put you in this unfair position and therefore anything is possible. So we think so. Ok</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:34.460" style="s2">So how much of that I&#39;m curious about that?</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.460" end="00:09:40.489" style="s2">I mean that it&#39;s a common it&#39;s a common human attitude to adopt that sort of perspective and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.830" end="00:09:42.830" style="s2">plenty of people have reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.170" end="00:09:44.970" style="s2">doubtful about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:51.740" style="s2">Appropriateness or fairness of their life in their situation but that you know, there&#39;s two things there that get tangled together</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.740" end="00:09:55.160" style="s2">I think and one is a sense of thwarted justice</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.410" end="00:10:00.859" style="s2">Right and that might be the optimistic viewpoint that people look out in the world and they see that it&#39;s unfair and that bothers them</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.960" end="00:10:06.499" style="s2">Morally, and and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being bothered that way but the problem too is is that adopting that?</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:14.630" style="s2">Victimization stance and worse maybe adopting a stance that justifies a certain amount of antisocial or criminal</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:19.460" style="s2">Attitude towards society given its unfairness also provides young people</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.010" end="00:10:22.969" style="s2">That&#39;s a young man in this case with an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.130" end="00:10:28.309" style="s2">not to do their best and not to put effort into anything and I think that that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.490" end="00:10:31.820" style="s2">excuse is often masked by a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.460" end="00:10:34.699" style="s2">self justification that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.400" end="00:10:38.359" style="s2">That hypothetical stressed striving for justice</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.330" end="00:10:49.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s another thing to use that as an excuse not to strive forward and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.310" end="00:10:54.920" style="s2">Right because there&#39;s a psychological element and a sociological element there that are at play. So so</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.370" end="00:12:28.790" style="s2">poverty in Appalachia called learned helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.820" end="00:12:37.369" style="s2">right, and I think that&#39;s a lot of it which is you disassociate your actions and behaviors with the outcome of what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.470" end="00:12:40.279" style="s2">experience in life and when you get to that point</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:47.809" style="s2">It&#39;s really hard to find the motivation to work hard or believe that there&#39;s a meritocracy at all in the world around you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.810" end="00:12:50.540" style="s2">All right, but the funny thing is about learned helplessness, you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.540" end="00:12:56.899" style="s2">And then this is something that I think it&#39;s really reasonable for us to delve into is that in the animal in the animal?</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.570" end="00:13:03.969" style="s2">Experimental world which is where the concept of learned helplessness emerges what happens that to produce learned helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.519" end="00:13:11.049" style="s2">What you do is you you punish an animal for any sort of active behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.329" end="00:13:12.619" style="s2">No matter what it does</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.619" end="00:13:15.789" style="s2">It&#39;s hopeless and it and it truly is hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.790" end="00:13:21.249" style="s2">right because the animal keeps trying but every time it tries to do whatever it&#39;s going to do it ends up being punished and</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.139" end="00:13:29.258" style="s2">Cease to act and that has been put forward at least in part as a model for depression</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.259" end="00:13:33.459" style="s2">And and I think there&#39;s a certain amount of validity to that. Although depression is a very complex concept</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.009" end="00:13:37.299" style="s2">the situation you&#39;re describing is somewhat different because</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.099" style="s2">what you pointed out was that when you were sitting at home as a as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.619" end="00:13:48.939" style="s2">Adolescent let&#39;s say and you had the choice between doing your homework and putting forward your your motive agency. However,</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.490" end="00:13:51.379" style="s2">forceful that might have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.379" end="00:13:53.558" style="s2">and justifying doing something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.110" end="00:13:57.159" style="s2">Slinking off to smoke dope and avoiding your responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.160" end="00:14:02.980" style="s2">You could justify the avoidance by making reference to the fundamental unfairness of society</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.980" end="00:14:10.149" style="s2">But that isn&#39;t the same as actually having tried really hard a dozen times or a hundred times and failed each time</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.309" end="00:14:17.889" style="s2">It&#39;s like it&#39;s more like the premature presumption of learned helplessness. And I do see this very frequently among young men</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.889" end="00:14:21.909" style="s2">is that they they&#39;ve adopted this attitude that the world is such a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.189" end="00:14:28.299" style="s2">catastrophic ly unfair place and life is so unjust in its fundamental essence that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.429" end="00:14:33.369" style="s2">There&#39;s no sense even trying to begin with that. You&#39;re only a fool if you do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.819" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">Yeah, I agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:42.519" style="s2">I think what happens is you see other people&#39;s failings or other other</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.889" end="00:14:45.459" style="s2">young men whether they&#39;re your peers or people you even just</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.709" end="00:14:52.119" style="s2">listen to in the music and music or you see on television or whatever the case you see their attempts and failures as</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.429" end="00:14:53.980" style="s2">Evidence of your own right?</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.980" end="00:14:56.559" style="s2">And so if hmm if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.559" end="00:15:02.709" style="s2">You know has struggled for example to go to college or university then that is in some way you trying right?</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.709" end="00:15:05.888" style="s2">You don&#39;t see a distinction between your own efforts and those of other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.259" end="00:15:10.539" style="s2">not that&#39;s how I would describe my mentality at the time, which is for instance I could</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.179" end="00:15:12.610" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.610" end="00:15:13.930" style="s2">Go on</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.930" end="00:15:16.260" style="s2">Turn on the news and see a story about</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.450" end="00:15:21.629" style="s2">Let&#39;s say like when I was really young kids seeing Rodney King got beat up by police officers in Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.640" end="00:15:24.780" style="s2">Right and that could stick with me and become</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:31.710" style="s2">an example of what someone like me would have gone through but for not being there at the time right and so you see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.710" end="00:15:34.289" style="s2">right empal and you internalize that as an instance of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.390" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">Well people like me when we walk around the street we get treated that way by cops</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:42.809" style="s2">So I might as well have gone through that too because I see that as an example of me</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.390" end="00:15:50.879" style="s2">Potentially exert, you know asserting myself in society and then paying a deep price for it, right? So it should emulate those right?</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:54.780" style="s2">So that&#39;s done. That&#39;s the the price paid for</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.780" end="00:15:59.489" style="s2">for adopting a certain dimension of identity and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.490" end="00:16:04.770" style="s2">I think it&#39;s inevitable to do that to some degree because we do belong to different group identities</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.110" end="00:16:09.390" style="s2">But you&#39;re saying that you you classified yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.390" end="00:16:13.590" style="s2">Let&#39;s say or you saw yourself in the same group as someone like Rodney King</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.020" end="00:16:20.340" style="s2">You saw that the group that he was attributed to you you believed that that was a valid group</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.680" end="00:16:22.799" style="s2">attribution and then drew</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.320" end="00:16:30.059" style="s2">Conclusions that weren&#39;t favorable to your own striving and that but that also still sets you up so that you&#39;re not really testing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.310" end="00:16:33.150" style="s2">Against the world, right? You&#39;re starting out with these assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.820" end="00:16:37.499" style="s2">About the privacy of group identity. Let&#39;s say it now you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.140" end="00:16:43.169" style="s2">curious about that too because you also talked about the negative consequences of fatherlessness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.750" end="00:16:51.270" style="s2">One of the so I&#39;m inferring from that that you see a link between the presence of a father</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:54.630" style="s2">And an antidote to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.930" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">Socialization by by what by popular culture group identity something like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:06.150" style="s2">I mean, we know that fairness isn&#39;t good for people by any spy by any measure. It&#39;s it&#39;s a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:12.568" style="s2">Yeah, well I think like if you&#39;re in that that that frame of mind where</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.240" end="00:17:20.219" style="s2">Those instances of group identity starts you tell you something about yourself then having a man in your house</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.220" end="00:17:22.410" style="s2">Who&#39;s not getting beat up by the cops is?</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:30.459" style="s2">Automatically what a complicated right having a man in your house who looks after his kids and goes to work and and takes responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.710" end="00:17:32.710" style="s2">For his family in this community</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.710" end="00:17:38.169" style="s2">who shows you how to love a woman and be kind to people that is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">Complication of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:47.620" style="s2">An other world view that might otherwise think that every other man who&#39;s not your dad has something to teach you about who you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.870" end="00:17:48.850" style="s2">Yeah, okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.850" end="00:17:52.419" style="s2">so that&#39;s identity centers a lot in that so the idea is something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.760" end="00:17:59.169" style="s2">If and I believe this like is one of the things I&#39;ve noticed about kids who are let&#39;s say neurologically intact</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.810" end="00:18:04.299" style="s2">so so maybe these are there&#39;s lots of reasons why people</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.780" end="00:18:13.420" style="s2">can develop psychological disorders and some of them are physical but imagine that you take a child who&#39;s physically healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.940" end="00:18:19.450" style="s2">You put them in a given environment. My my intuition has been that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.060" end="00:18:22.060" style="s2">Child needs to have at least one</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.730" end="00:18:24.730" style="s2">positive role model within</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:29.889" style="s2">Immitation distance now. Sometimes he or she can sort of piece that together</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.440" end="00:18:33.130" style="s2">Fragmentarily also from popular media images, you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.130" end="00:18:39.159" style="s2">The images of the heroes in movies and so on but it&#39;s really helpful to have at least one person in your immediate environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.740" end="00:18:40.910" style="s2">who is</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.910" end="00:18:43.930" style="s2">manifesting the pattern that characterizes individual success</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.930" end="00:18:49.570" style="s2">and so maybe it&#39;s something like if that positive role model isn&#39;t there then the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.790" end="00:18:54.279" style="s2">Default is to a victimized group identity. Does that seem reasonable? I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.860" end="00:19:01.750" style="s2">Think it&#39;s reasonable, especially if you&#39;re if you&#39;re from a community and you share an identity that has been</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.780" end="00:19:04.730" style="s2">very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.730" end="00:19:08.889" style="s2">associated with victimization in the first place and I think that&#39;s a big part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.990" end="00:19:13.389" style="s2">You know when you when when I was a kid and thought of myself as a black man</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:20.289" style="s2">that immediately came with a certain kind of baggage of historical and present-day victimization and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.140" end="00:19:22.750" style="s2">Because my father is black</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.750" end="00:19:27.339" style="s2">my mother is white so him being gone and and in some ways being my</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.560" end="00:19:31.269" style="s2">My kind of connection to the to a black family being gone</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.270" end="00:19:32.390" style="s2">I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.390" end="00:19:35.859" style="s2">Very vulnerable to how blackness was being presented to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.050" end="00:19:42.259" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t have a black person house showing me something different and the blackness that I was presented was one that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.510" end="00:19:47.900" style="s2">Deeply tied to victimization right and one that was constantly excusing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.450" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">any poor behavior we might have</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.060" end="00:19:56.869" style="s2">maybe not more than any other group of people but but associating any poor behavior we might have with</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:00.169" style="s2">History, right? And so it&#39;s this idea that you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.080" end="00:20:02.550" style="s2">inheriting</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.550" end="00:20:05.659" style="s2">low expectations of yourself and of your behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.090" end="00:20:10.399" style="s2">And you don&#39;t know what it would look like to look in the mirror and not see a victim, right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:16.040" style="s2">Would that even be right great where I didn&#39;t know it also provides that Avenue for justification that we already described</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.040" end="00:20:19.009" style="s2">And so okay. So so let&#39;s look at this two ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:24.379" style="s2">well, there&#39;s an old psychoanalytic idea, you know of secondary gains and so if we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.470" end="00:20:27.470" style="s2">critical in our analysis about</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.960" end="00:20:30.139" style="s2">victimization culture we might ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.140" end="00:20:36.860" style="s2">Well, what benefits does it bring to the people who adopt it so and you know those can and when I mean benefits</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.860" end="00:20:38.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean long-term</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.660" end="00:20:41.550" style="s2">iterative</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.550" end="00:20:44.239" style="s2">high-quality benefits, I mean short-term payoffs</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:49.550" style="s2">Let&#39;s say you know how it is if you have work to do and you avoid it that&#39;s a short-term payoff. It&#39;s a benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.280" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2">Because you don&#39;t have to do the work now. There&#39;s a medium to long term cost but</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:21:00.769" style="s2">I&#39;m very curious about about the the element of victimization culture that justifies I</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">Think antisocial and avoidant behavior is probably the right way of putting it now</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:09.049" style="s2">You know where I grew up I grew up in a working-class community</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:14.210" style="s2">And I had friends and associates who were who ranged from you know?</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.210" end="00:21:18.409" style="s2">pretty decent kids to pretty solidly planted in the delinquent camp and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.050" end="00:21:25.100" style="s2">generally, the more delinquent types had a whole handful of rationalizations for their behavior and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:31.339" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s very dangerous to have those rationalizations at hand because most forms of anti-social behavior</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.040" end="00:21:36.980" style="s2">Or avoidant behavior for that matter very bad medium to long term strategies. So</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.650" end="00:21:38.910" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.910" end="00:21:44.869" style="s2">What negative psychological elements of yours do you think the victimization narrative?</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:49.489" style="s2">Supported and what positive aspects did it suppress?</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.690" end="00:21:55.190" style="s2">Well it the the negative ones is supported were</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.929" end="00:21:59.400" style="s2">What it</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.400" end="00:22:03.229" style="s2">wanting to be mad at my circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.049" end="00:22:09.589" style="s2">To not see anyway, I might be responsible for changing them, right? Yeah, so</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.830" end="00:22:12.949" style="s2">Justification for I was looking for that justification</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.020" end="00:22:13.640" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.640" end="00:22:17.059" style="s2">the other thing that it does and I don&#39;t know if it was unique to me because I think it&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.130" end="00:22:20.479" style="s2">Variations of it in everybody, but it just means that you don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.030" end="00:22:23.989" style="s2">The burden of solving a problem, right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.990" end="00:22:30.919" style="s2">I mean, it&#39;s hard to walk around feeling like if you worked a little bit harder if you listen to people</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.919" end="00:22:32.919" style="s2">who care about you if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">You know just made the effort and put the time in that maybe things could be different that makes you you you feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.780" end="00:22:43.369" style="s2">Responsible for that and when and that comes with the possibility of failing, right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.370" end="00:22:49.010" style="s2">Yes, Gary to think that you you could do something and if you don&#39;t get it, then you&#39;re failing out</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.010" end="00:22:51.859" style="s2">yeah, so that&#39;s another interesting thing about that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:54.859" style="s2">assumption of learned helplessness is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">if you don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.960" end="00:23:01.669" style="s2">Huh as Homer Simpson told Bart if you never try you can&#39;t fail</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.220" end="00:23:05.179" style="s2">Okay, great. Right, right, so which is very comical</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.179" end="00:23:11.418" style="s2">So that was that was definitely I would say like a negative part of my thinking that wanting to see myself as a victim supported</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.299" end="00:23:17.899" style="s2">In terms of the positive stuff that it kind of pushed down. I think it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.600" end="00:23:20.600" style="s2">meant that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.260" end="00:23:26.089" style="s2">For example was willing to put my mom through some really</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.790" end="00:23:28.909" style="s2">I did some really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:35.209" style="s2">situations where she had to stress and worry about me and what I was doing and I would later learn that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.429" end="00:23:37.410" style="s2">positive power to actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.410" end="00:23:44.419" style="s2">Burn value to her life and to make things easier for her and to help her raise my sisters and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.940" end="00:23:46.940" style="s2">Those are strengths that I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.190" end="00:23:54.919" style="s2">those are that is a desire for for responsibility and to be part of a family that I had that I was that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.260" end="00:23:58.459" style="s2">didn&#39;t learn about myself until later on because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.070" end="00:24:00.150" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">Couldn&#39;t see myself as someone who had assets right who had strengths to offer</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.940" end="00:24:06.940" style="s2">Yeah, there&#39;s always about</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.950" end="00:24:14.529" style="s2">What other people were doing to me? Yeah, not about how I might positively affect somebody else or at minimum not negative. Right, right</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.529" end="00:24:19.299" style="s2">well, which is definitely something well, yeah, so one of the things it&#39;s interesting with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.909" end="00:24:26.378" style="s2">Conversation about responsibility because one of the things that I&#39;ve been talking to audiences about all around the world now is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.690" end="00:24:32.830" style="s2">That maybe we find the sustaining meaning in their life precisely through the adoption of responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.830" end="00:24:36.429" style="s2">And you know you talked about reasons to be terrified of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.429" end="00:24:39.908" style="s2">And I think those are valid reasons what if you try and fail</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.249" end="00:24:46.449" style="s2">especially when there&#39;s a fair bit of evidence around that that might be either the most likely path and it is in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.450" end="00:24:50.859" style="s2">You have to often try a lot of things before you succeed. Even if you turn out to be a successful person</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.529" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">but the price that you pay for abandoning that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.470" end="00:25:02.379" style="s2">responsibility is that that is where you find the meaning in life that can buttress you against the fact that life is unfair and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.659" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:04.820" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.820" end="00:25:09.429" style="s2">What would you call typify by suffering and also by malevolence and betrayal, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.429" end="00:25:15.998" style="s2">You talked about discovering later in life that you could be a positive asset to your family and that&#39;s a big discovery, man</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.009" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">It&#39;s really something to be able to wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night and think well</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:22.009" style="s2">you know, at least I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.009" end="00:25:24.608" style="s2">I&#39;m doing something positive for the people that love me</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.220" end="00:25:27.220" style="s2">To not have that&#39;s really a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.500" end="00:25:36.869" style="s2">Absolutely, the other thing is you you you tone you kind of tune out a lot of the people in your life who</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.390" end="00:25:41.640" style="s2">Might have really important things to say to you right who might possess some genuine wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.770" end="00:25:45.989" style="s2">but because what they&#39;re saying doesn&#39;t line up with the ideology you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.809" end="00:25:48.809" style="s2">unknowingly in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.940" end="00:25:51.780" style="s2">Clung to so strongly you don&#39;t hear them</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.780" end="00:25:53.780" style="s2">and so the good people in your life that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.830" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">Actually might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:26:00.929" style="s2">Teach you something and put the right idea in your head and plant a seed that could grow into something beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.480" end="00:26:05.699" style="s2">those people become less important to you and instead the the folks, who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.220" end="00:26:12.300" style="s2">manipulative in some cases who want to tell you negative things and want you to believe that you can&#39;t do something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.550" end="00:26:17.699" style="s2">Like you might you are you are destined to suffer until the evil system around right has collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.130" end="00:26:23.579" style="s2">people who tell you that or variations of that message are the folks that you you hear from and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.520" end="00:26:27.869" style="s2">That that&#39;s sad because when I look back there were good people in my life</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.870" end="00:26:31.439" style="s2">and there were people who at my school who did do really well and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.630" end="00:26:35.369" style="s2">I would say in fact maybe most people in my community made really good decisions</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.710" end="00:26:38.760" style="s2">And cared for each other and did really good things</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.760" end="00:26:40.829" style="s2">And yeah, I was trapped in a world where I couldn&#39;t see them</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.830" end="00:26:43.559" style="s2">They didn&#39;t even exist in my narrative about my life</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.630" end="00:26:49.829" style="s2">Those people were either anomalies or they just didn&#39;t they were not part of my worldview at all. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.830" end="00:26:53.100" style="s2">Well, the thing is too is that people who start down the bad road?</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.100" end="00:26:57.990" style="s2">let&#39;s say the bad road sake that&#39;s characterized by irresponsibility avoidance and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.900" end="00:27:04.019" style="s2">Like a kind of a cruel rebellion a cruel and counterproductive rebellion, you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.020" end="00:27:11.160" style="s2">They&#39;re also they also tend to be quite annoyed and irritated by counter examples and so they are likely to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.530" end="00:27:14.399" style="s2">Someone else a younger person for example or their peers</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.280" end="00:27:16.870" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.870" end="00:27:20.130" style="s2">Participating in behaviors that aren&#39;t in anyone&#39;s best interest</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.679" end="00:27:22.709" style="s2">Because they don&#39;t want the counter-examples</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.900" end="00:27:29.189" style="s2">around and why would you if you you don&#39;t want to be you don&#39;t want to have your cynicism proved wrong because that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.350" end="00:27:31.860" style="s2">Shattering, you know, even though it would be the best thing for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.220" end="00:27:39.419" style="s2">Yeah, absolutely. Right? I think that&#39;s absolutely right and the transition I wound up experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:44.680" style="s2">Where I get out of high school and and kind of find my voice</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.470" end="00:27:48.189" style="s2">comes out of some things that were completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.910" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:57.189" style="s2">Unintentional right? So I get to this point in grade 11 after I rewrite the literacy tests that we have to take in in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.230" end="00:28:00.069" style="s2">Ontario public schools I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.650" end="00:28:04.749" style="s2">Finally considered literate. So that means I can finish high school and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.720" end="00:28:06.770" style="s2">get very</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.770" end="00:28:11.770" style="s2">Desperate to earn money because I didn&#39;t see a future where I could earn money legally</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.770" end="00:28:14.589" style="s2">I thought I would have to be a criminal and I I genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.230" end="00:28:22.209" style="s2">Believed that was my my destiny. And so I come close to buying a gun and I asked a friend for it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.210" end="00:28:24.140" style="s2">He quotes me a price</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.140" end="00:28:25.640" style="s2">He says let me know</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.640" end="00:28:30.160" style="s2">When you want it, and I go home on a day where I thought I was going to feel like a million bucks</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.160" end="00:28:36.759" style="s2">cuz I finally had this tool of a criminal enterprise that I had been looking forward to and I wind up just</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.040" end="00:28:41.619" style="s2">like crying my eyes out and I was devastated and I was scared and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.780" end="00:28:48.790" style="s2">If my mom found out I had a gun she might give up on me and disown me I was okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.790" end="00:28:49.960" style="s2">So that&#39;s oh that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.960" end="00:28:57.550" style="s2">so part of what called out to you when you were making what would have been a life-changing decision was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.890" end="00:29:00.099" style="s2">violation of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.830" end="00:29:02.830" style="s2">intimate relationship that you had</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.990" end="00:29:06.370" style="s2">The love that you had that your mother had bestowed on you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.410" end="00:29:07.660" style="s2">So you were yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.660" end="00:29:14.499" style="s2">You felt deeply by all appearances that you were betraying that what else brought you to tears because you said, you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.500" end="00:29:18.189" style="s2">You felt you thought that one possibility was that you&#39;d feel somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.350" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">triumphant and finally managing this task and and joining the that the cast of outcasts, but that isn&#39;t how your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.090" end="00:29:27.530" style="s2">responded</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.530" end="00:29:35.379" style="s2">No, my conscience responded with with a fear knowing how owning a gun sends you into a spiral</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.380" end="00:29:37.599" style="s2">I had seen other people go go down</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.630" end="00:29:43.479" style="s2">You know when you own a gun as a young man, especially in a if you intend to use it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:45.410" style="s2">You wind up having?</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.410" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">problems with people who have guns and all of a sudden just to walk around the street you feel like you have to carry a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:55.969" style="s2">Gun on you for your own safety. Like if you look at the lives of young men who?</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.610" end="00:30:04.610" style="s2">Wind up either victims or perpetrators in inner-city gang violence. Those are often young men who are committing what they call</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.370" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">Retaliatory bond. Yes, right. It is a web of responding to trauma and and killings and I was very scared</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:15.259" style="s2">I would be in the middle of something like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.690" end="00:30:18.379" style="s2">the other thing that really bothered me was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.690" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">concern that I was so angry at police officers for how I&#39;d seen them shoot my father when I was a kid and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.930" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">the treatment that I had experienced in terms of being followed around</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.980" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">The mall or followed home from the bus stop and seeing things like I mentioned, you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.800" end="00:30:36.560" style="s2">the Rodney King beating and having that be part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.530" end="00:30:41.930" style="s2">How I saw how the world worked and and and it presented a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.390" end="00:30:45.920" style="s2">Almost like a disturbing rite of passage right as a black man</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.920" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">I felt like well when that happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:53.749" style="s2">That means you&#39;re growing up because people are supposed to think you&#39;re dangerous and a criminal and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.330" end="00:30:56.300" style="s2">You know, there&#39;s even something about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.300" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s true because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:03.830" style="s2">Think that people are supposed to think that you&#39;re dangerous when you grow up the question is what do you do with the dangerousness?</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.110" end="00:31:09.320" style="s2">You know, so there is a yeah because you don&#39;t want to be naive and weak it&#39;s not help. Absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.320" end="00:31:15.019" style="s2">But that there have a path there has to be a pathway to strength that isn&#39;t associated with catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:22.160" style="s2">yeah, well in my case it felt like I had Ari I had already felt like I was being treated like someone who carried a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.160" end="00:31:29.719" style="s2">gun around and there was something that really where I was almost disgusted by myself with the idea that I might validate that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.120" end="00:31:33.469" style="s2">stereotype by then doing that thing, right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.260" end="00:31:40.010" style="s2">and and so there was this like conflate it was a it was a mix of shame that I felt right a mix of</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.710" end="00:31:43.700" style="s2">fear and a certain sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.090" end="00:31:48.110" style="s2">You know worrying that I might never be able to come back from that decision</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.110" end="00:31:53.930" style="s2">And so what the positive effect all of that had on me is I wound up isolating</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.090" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">Myself from my social network, like all the friends I had who I&#39;d spent years talking tough with and sharing</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:02.500" style="s2">you know gangster fairy tales and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.080" end="00:32:07.129" style="s2">And and and things like that. I wound up just not being able to show my face around them</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.129" end="00:32:10.248" style="s2">Like I was scared they would think I was a punk. I&#39;m a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.860" end="00:32:14.809" style="s2">So you decided not to purchase the gun as a concept, I do not know</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.809" end="00:32:15.169" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.169" end="00:32:17.169" style="s2">And so and that that and my life</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.309" end="00:32:18.299" style="s2">Changed really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.299" end="00:32:24.319" style="s2">Because all the people I&#39;ve skipping class are that I didn&#39;t want to see anymore and the people I was smoking drugs with I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">Want to hang out with and the people who?</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.669" end="00:32:33.829" style="s2">You know, I wasted so much of my time with the people who we cultivated that kind of victimization identity together</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.169" end="00:32:38.689" style="s2">No longer were part of my life except for a few outliers. And so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.749" end="00:32:46.339" style="s2">Unknowingly put myself in a situation where I could just think about the world differently and I started to go to class</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.710" end="00:32:49.879" style="s2">Seriously for the first time and I wasn&#39;t a good student overnight</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.879" end="00:32:53.149" style="s2">Like I finished I had to do day school in night school to graduate on time</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.149" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">And I just so badly wanted to get out of that building the high school. So I just left and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.980" end="00:33:01.789" style="s2">And the way to leave was to was to get my credits</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.789" end="00:33:05.988" style="s2">So I graduate I wind up at Humber College because in one of the transfer program</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.029" end="00:33:10.429" style="s2">Let&#39;s go through that in a bit more detail because it&#39;s pretty quite a remarkable story. So</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.009" end="00:33:17.959" style="s2">Okay, so you had a choice point in your life and and the choice point was whether or not you were gonna well become armed</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.960" end="00:33:19.799" style="s2">and dangerous fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.799" end="00:33:24.229" style="s2">Yeah and take that particular path and you decided not to you had a crisis of conscience</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.690" end="00:33:27.830" style="s2">You decided not to and that in the that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.350" end="00:33:34.639" style="s2">Allowed you or forced you hard to say which to alienate you from your peers</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.649" end="00:33:38.479" style="s2">But that must have been very lonesome. Like how did you put up with that?</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:43.189" style="s2">Yeah, it wasn&#39;t easy and this is actually one of the hardest things</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.279" end="00:33:51.378" style="s2">that I talk about with young men who are going through similar experiences as I&#39;m describing in terms of negative peer pressure is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.960" end="00:33:53.929" style="s2">It&#39;s really hard to accept being alone</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.929" end="00:33:56.479" style="s2">And I don&#39;t know why I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.730" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">Able to do it quite honestly because I look back and I think I&#39;m not sure at 31 I could do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:03.949" style="s2">Yeah, right exactly. That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s quite because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a huge transformation not only to start buckling down at school</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:17.299" style="s2">Especially at that age because you know, you had 16 years of not being disciplined. Let&#39;s say and also</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.180" end="00:34:20.569" style="s2">isolating yourself from your peers at a point where</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.180" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">Arguably there&#39;s nothing more important than that peer Association</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.660" end="00:34:26.510" style="s2">So and what did your mother make of this?</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.510" end="00:34:30.230" style="s2">I mean all of a sudden you weren&#39;t seeing your friends and you were studying. I mean, she must have been shocked</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.350" end="00:34:34.339" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure she knew what was going on to be honest because</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.890" end="00:34:40.039" style="s2">We didn&#39;t communicate much like we lived in the same house, but she was so busy. Just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.860" end="00:34:46.849" style="s2">You know get to the next day and pay the bills and and make sure we had a house and and everything we needed</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.010" end="00:34:53.239" style="s2">That I didn&#39;t really have an adult in my life who was providing any supervision. Right, right</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:59.180" style="s2">For example, my mom never signed off for in all four years of high school. She never signed off those papers</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.180" end="00:35:03.799" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to say I&#39;m acknowledging you saw your kids or poor card because I would just Forge it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:08.029" style="s2">Bring it in and and she never said anything because she wasn&#39;t paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.610" end="00:35:10.789" style="s2">I I didn&#39;t say anything to her</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.820" end="00:35:17.390" style="s2">And so we had this this period of time where we were just ships passing in the night that we had barely any interaction</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">but she still revered there was a phrase you used in your conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.410" end="00:35:28.549" style="s2">Group of boys for the BBC radio at a boxing club where you said you need someone in your life who?</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:30.710" style="s2">represents the light at the end of the tunnel</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.750" end="00:35:33.560" style="s2">Yeah, and that&#39;s what my mom was to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.560" end="00:35:34.910" style="s2">like even when we didn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.910" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">even when I was angry at her for picking my father and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.380" end="00:35:47.150" style="s2">Putting me in a situation where I had a parent who rejected me and I resented her for it and yet she still had this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:50.390" style="s2">belief in me that never went away this belief that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.820" end="00:35:56.870" style="s2">Some point Jamil could be better than he&#39;s proven himself to be right. So she was that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.870" end="00:36:01.910" style="s2">So it wasn&#39;t just her. It was also the fact that you had someone around that actually had more faith in you than you did</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.030" end="00:36:06.229" style="s2">Exactly. Yeah, and and and and I think that&#39;s such a key part</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.230" end="00:36:11.150" style="s2">Yeah, I agree when you really need that from a parent a if you get that from both parents</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.150" end="00:36:16.489" style="s2">You&#39;re unbelievably fortunate but you desperately need it from at least one person. Someone&#39;s gotta believe in you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:23.239" style="s2">Yeah, so that the reason I get comfortable I guess with with loneliness is you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.240" end="00:36:27.620" style="s2">And this is I think the role that the internet I think still plays in people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.620" end="00:36:30.019" style="s2">Which is when you break away from us</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:34.690" style="s2">From an in-person social network at a school or a workplace or whatever the case</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.850" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">The internet becomes the place where you can find an alternative social network and in my case</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.470" end="00:36:44.740" style="s2">I was on these, you know, these like hiphop message boards all the time when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.740" end="00:36:52.329" style="s2">I was always online reading about hip-hop and like conspiracy theories and I got caught up in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">like Nation of Islam</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.920" end="00:36:56.920" style="s2">doctrine and propaganda and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.410" end="00:37:03.009" style="s2">Those ideas were especially helpful to be honest in some cases. I think they delayed my</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:10.659" style="s2">Ability to shake off the victimization identity I had adopted but what it did do for me was it just gave me an alternative?</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.820" end="00:37:14.590" style="s2">Place to belong and so yeah those became the social networks</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.590" end="00:37:16.690" style="s2">I had were online relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.120" end="00:37:20.829" style="s2">I think that was part of how I was able to adjust away from my friend</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.990" end="00:37:25.449" style="s2">circle was that I just had a bunch of stuff on the internet that I could I</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.850" end="00:37:30.970" style="s2">Could go to and feel like I was connecting with people in another way. Okay now also now you said</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.700" end="00:37:35.529" style="s2">Something interesting. You said that you really wanted to get out of that building and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.290" end="00:37:37.510" style="s2">speaking about your school</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.510" end="00:37:43.600" style="s2">But the way that you chose to get out was to path to graduate and pass was to accomplish the tasks</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.600" end="00:37:46.660" style="s2">Now why in the world did you decide that that was a good idea. I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.870" end="00:37:51.759" style="s2">Suppose that&#39;s also because I wasn&#39;t sure what else I would do like at the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:54.310" style="s2">You know, I was a kid who I did my grade 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.490" end="00:37:57.020" style="s2">career</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.020" end="00:38:02.080" style="s2">Project. My career&#39;s project saying that I was going to be the Canadian Suge Knight, right?</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.080" end="00:38:06.789" style="s2">Who&#39;s a gangster who started a record label that produced Tupac and Snoop Dogg and these guys?</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.310" end="00:38:11.740" style="s2">That&#39;s what I thought like my future was gonna be like and when that gets like taken from you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.960" end="00:38:17.529" style="s2">Because you realize you&#39;re not this game of chicken. You&#39;ve been playing with yourself. You&#39;re going to lose it</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.530" end="00:38:19.530" style="s2">And so you get off the train tracks</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.730" end="00:38:25.869" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know what else to do and I just thought I have to just walk the path that was available to me which</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.870" end="00:38:29.799" style="s2">Was okay. So go through school. Hey, well that that&#39;s a brilliant observation</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.800" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">I think because one of the things that people have often asked me when they&#39;re when they&#39;re directionless is well, what should I do?</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:43.299" style="s2">And the answer is well, you take the best path that&#39;s laid out ahead of you. All right, if you don&#39;t have an option</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.990" end="00:38:50.679" style="s2">Where you are staying in despair not moving forward is a very bad option if you have a bad pathway forward</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.050" end="00:38:56.289" style="s2">Or a suboptimal pathway forward let&#39;s say but it&#39;s at least forward then that&#39;s the one you should choose</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.290" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">And so you decided that you were gonna buckle down and get the hell out of school and you were gonna do it by passing</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.119" end="00:39:04.779" style="s2">Yeah, well, I I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t feel like I was choosing</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.630" end="00:39:10.540" style="s2">To do it by passing. I just thought that was my way out and I wasn&#39;t sure how else to get out</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.540" end="00:39:13.330" style="s2">Alright because if I dropped out, I don&#39;t know what else I would do</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.390" end="00:39:20.619" style="s2">So in the process of trying to you know, rush out right? I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m working as a dishwasher at Red Lobster. I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.500" end="00:39:28.030" style="s2">Taking night classes. I&#39;m taking day classes. I&#39;m trying to get out of my circumstances as quickly as I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.700" end="00:39:32.260" style="s2">Guidance counselor says to me but you don&#39;t qualify for many programs</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.390" end="00:39:37.810" style="s2">You were streamed in the in the applied system, which was what we call in, Ontario</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.810" end="00:39:43.209" style="s2">Which means you can&#39;t go to university you&#39;ve got to go to Community College, but your grades are so bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.210" end="00:39:49.389" style="s2">There&#39;s no Community College program. You could get into except for what they call general Arts and Sciences program</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.790" end="00:39:54.489" style="s2">Which in some ways is almost like what grade 13 used to be in Ontario</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.490" end="00:39:57.219" style="s2">Which is you would learn a lot of the things you should have learned in grade 12</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.220" end="00:40:00.879" style="s2">but didn&#39;t and so I go into that program and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.400" end="00:40:02.510" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.510" end="00:40:09.790" style="s2">What what what changed for me immediately in terms of my academics was this is the first time I had college professors</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.040" end="00:40:11.780" style="s2">Who said to me?</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.780" end="00:40:18.550" style="s2">Here you&#39;ve got to write this, you know, twenty page essay you get to decide what it&#39;s about and it seems so simple</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.830" end="00:40:24.189" style="s2">But it was a breakthrough for me because what that meant was the part of me that was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.230" end="00:40:28.689" style="s2">You know hip-hop and the Nation of Islam and conspiracy theories and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.690" end="00:40:32.139" style="s2">I was doing on the internet that no adult had ever seen before. Nope</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.140" end="00:40:37.540" style="s2">My mom my teachers no one had ever seen a part of me that could think critically that had</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.970" end="00:40:44.500" style="s2">Curiosity intellectually that part of me and and the version of me that was going to school merged for the first time, right?</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.500" end="00:40:52.090" style="s2">Well, thank God that&#39;s that&#39;s the huge advantage of higher education is that is exactly what should happen, right? So absolutely. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.090" end="00:40:53.950" style="s2">Yeah, and that&#39;s what I try to tell young men</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.950" end="00:40:58.300" style="s2">all the time is like you might be going through a hard time in high school and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.520" end="00:41:03.580" style="s2">It&#39;s hard sometimes to know how life could mine is going to be different if you just stay the course</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.190" end="00:41:06.820" style="s2">Because you have no reference point to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:13.660" style="s2">But in my case, I it was it was absolutely a meaningful shift like the idea that I could write 20 pages about</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.120" end="00:41:18.279" style="s2">You know Malcolm X or about Tupac like all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:22.929" style="s2">the the writing ability that I had never shown people before started to come out and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.330" end="00:41:28.419" style="s2">My analytical thinking and all it was just it flowed out of me and literally in less than a year</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">I went from barely getting out of high school</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.370" end="00:41:37.630" style="s2">Say getting the highest grades in all of Humber College and and that was not something that ever felt deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.630" end="00:41:44.890" style="s2">I was just kind of stumbling around in the dark and hoping things are gonna work out for the better my mom for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.890" end="00:41:46.370" style="s2">When she came to my graduation</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.370" end="00:41:51.849" style="s2">At Humber like she was shocked that I gotten of the President&#39;s Medal for highest grades</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.850" end="00:41:56.799" style="s2">Like she had no idea that I was actually a completely different person by that point</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.170" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">Well, you said something interesting too about what you were doing in high school</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:06.549" style="s2">You said that you were attending classes during the day and at night and you were working as a dishwasher?</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.370" end="00:42:10.089" style="s2">As a dishwasher, right? Yes. Yeah, okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.090" end="00:42:16.239" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting too because one of the things that&#39;s very useful I think to point out to people who are in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.370" end="00:42:22.779" style="s2">Situation that&#39;s analogous to the one that you found yourself in is that there is something to be said for trying to make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.780" end="00:42:24.969" style="s2">So busy that it&#39;s absolutely ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.850" end="00:42:30.069" style="s2">You know to take on a big burden that&#39;s part of that burden of responsibility. It&#39;s like, okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.070" end="00:42:32.769" style="s2">Can I go to school during the day and can I go to school at night?</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.770" end="00:42:34.870" style="s2">And can I also work at a job?</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.870" end="00:42:40.779" style="s2">Can I do all that because the answer is I&#39;ve seen this time and time again with undergraduates who start to work in my lab</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.090" end="00:42:45.100" style="s2">It&#39;s like they&#39;re already taking a full course load and they&#39;re busy and some of them also have work</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.100" end="00:42:48.219" style="s2">You know, they have part-time jobs and then they come and work in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.220" end="00:42:50.320" style="s2">and so then they&#39;re so busy that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.420" end="00:42:56.470" style="s2">Ridiculous and then they have to get organized and they can&#39;t waste time and their grades almost inevitably go up not down</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.020" end="00:43:00.709" style="s2">Yeah, and and it&#39;s one of those things where</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.290" end="00:43:05.540" style="s2">Before you get to a point where you get busy like that you have no idea you&#39;re capable</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.700" end="00:43:13.250" style="s2">Yeah, right accomplishing so many things and then it starts to become normal to achieve right? It&#39;s it&#39;s normal to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.250" end="00:43:16.670" style="s2">oh, I could set out and accomplish something in a given day or</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.190" end="00:43:22.040" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s always it. It also becomes it also becomes something that&#39;s really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.590" end="00:43:29.689" style="s2">Experiment with because once you stir once you start realizing that your capability for responsibility exceeds your original expectations</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.090" end="00:43:33.590" style="s2">You start to become curious about what the limitations of that are. It&#39;s like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.200" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">Turns out I can do a lot more than I thought I could or that people told me I could or that I was willing</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:45.290" style="s2">To believe how much more could I actually do if I really got my act together and got disciplined? It&#39;s like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.870" end="00:43:47.150" style="s2">Purpose it&#39;s like what?</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.150" end="00:43:48.270" style="s2">What are you made out of?</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.270" end="00:43:53.150" style="s2">And how do you find out and I think you really need to find that out as a you certainly have to find that out</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:55.160" style="s2">As a young man, you probably have to find that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.160" end="00:43:56.360" style="s2">I was a person in general</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.360" end="00:44:02.239" style="s2">but it&#39;s absolutely crucial for young men to find out that there was far more to them than they think and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.340" end="00:44:05.209" style="s2">You can&#39;t find that out without burdening yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.090" end="00:44:11.509" style="s2">You&#39;re right. And it is it&#39;s it&#39;s the opposite of what we were talking about earlier in terms of that fear of failure, right?</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.510" end="00:44:14.030" style="s2">because it&#39;s saying I&#39;m gonna push myself to the limit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.340" end="00:44:20.449" style="s2">Explore where that line of failing is and because you&#39;re not running from that one. No, you&#39;re running toward you where it exists</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.670" end="00:44:23.209" style="s2">Absolutely, and the funny thing is about running towards that line</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.210" end="00:44:26.120" style="s2">is that as you walk towards it it recedes and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.370" end="00:44:30.949" style="s2">As you as you get more disciplined the probability that you&#39;ll fail gets smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.980" end="00:44:37.100" style="s2">Perfect example of the pathology of avoidance right because avoidance of that just makes you weak</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.040" end="00:44:40.040" style="s2">yeah, absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.200" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">You know the the transition from Humber College to York University</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.510" end="00:44:48.949" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s just kind of a continuation of what you&#39;re describing, right</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.950" end="00:44:56.689" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s running to the line and it&#39;s me continuing to say okay, maybe that 12 years of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:44:58.940" style="s2">I have of being a really poor student</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:02.120" style="s2">Could be proven wrong with every assignment that I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.220" end="00:45:08.449" style="s2">right and leaving that if I try in this class and I get an A and all of a sudden getting an A stops being</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.420" end="00:45:12.050" style="s2">The an anomaly it starts to become normal, right?</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.050" end="00:45:16.009" style="s2">And and and then when you don&#39;t get an A or a B or whatever your you&#39;re hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.230" end="00:45:19.730" style="s2">You start to feel that sting of disappointment because you actually have higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.130" end="00:45:26.749" style="s2">Expectations of yourself and your professors who didn&#39;t know you back when you were a knucklehead getting into trouble</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.750" end="00:45:32.239" style="s2">they only know you as the guy who came into their class and tried hard and so they start to speak to you as</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.340" end="00:45:34.610" style="s2">Someone who could do really well - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.370" end="00:45:42.049" style="s2">Because that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s so lovely - about about about being able to go off to somewhere new, you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.300" end="00:45:45.259" style="s2">Because you could leave your past identity behind you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.290" end="00:45:49.820" style="s2">I found that such a relief when I moved from the little town that I grew up in even because I went to a community</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.820" end="00:45:54.799" style="s2">College for the first two years of my education as well and I had an experience. That was well</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">Yours is more dramatic by quite a substantial margin, but it they&#39;re not dissimilar</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:04.669" style="s2">I was so relieved when I got to college that I could start to write and think about things that I was actually thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.670" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">That it was like a complete transformation</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:12.530" style="s2">But I also had the chance to leave my old personality behind at least at least some of it, you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.530" end="00:46:15.560" style="s2">some of it some of it that I didn&#39;t want to carry ahead with me and</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.930" end="00:46:23.150" style="s2">and that&#39;s another thing about moving forward in the world is that you can leave the old and insufficient you behind and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.670" end="00:46:27.110" style="s2">That that can be hard on you and hard on people around you - but man</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.110" end="00:46:30.019" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s such a relief. It&#39;s and it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s life itself. I would say it&#39;s the opposite of despair</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.579" end="00:46:38.119" style="s2">And that&#39;s absolutely right and I as</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.759" end="00:46:40.739" style="s2">much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.739" end="00:46:43.879" style="s2">Create the circumstances for that to happen in your life</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.880" end="00:46:49.819" style="s2">Even if you don&#39;t have a chance to move somewhere new or go to a new school or or get a new job</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.819" end="00:46:51.749" style="s2">but but just</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.749" end="00:46:59.389" style="s2">Convince yourself that renewal is something you get to decide and get to control. I mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.509" end="00:47:05.898" style="s2">Part of being a victim is to is to notice all of a sudden that you have the capacity to transform yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.109" end="00:47:13.038" style="s2">Despite at least to a large degree despite external circumstances or or sometimes even as a consequence of leveraging them</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.289" end="00:47:18.109" style="s2">Because it isn&#39;t always obvious that that having an impediment is a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.689" end="00:47:23.839" style="s2">Sometimes it&#39;s a I mean, it&#39;s what would you call it? It&#39;s a call to action. It&#39;s a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.169" end="00:47:30.829" style="s2">Absolutely, and in some ways the the the challenging periods of my life that we&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.469" end="00:47:38.239" style="s2">provided a roadmap for what I would do with with the remainder of my academic career, which is I would pursue opportunities where I could</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.789" end="00:47:44.359" style="s2">Imagine going back in time and solving some of the problems I had experienced right and and that I studied</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.269" end="00:47:48.708" style="s2">international development and nonprofit management at York</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.709" end="00:47:54.769" style="s2">I went and did a law degree because I thought the law was was relevant to my life and insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.529" end="00:48:01.789" style="s2">It made a difference and how I wound up and how some of my peer group did and that I was lucky to not be</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.789" end="00:48:03.789" style="s2">involved in the legal system, so</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.259" end="00:48:08.388" style="s2">yeah, I mean it was a call to action for me and I think it gave me the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.239" end="00:48:15.648" style="s2">motivation but also the the toughness I would need to to push forward and do things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.469" end="00:48:19.309" style="s2">You know, I had good reason to believe we&#39;re impossible, you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.309" end="00:48:23.658" style="s2">because the victim narrative is something like well you&#39;re so little compared to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.539" end="00:48:29.539" style="s2">Arrayed against you in all of its historical catastrophe, right which is like the evil father</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.669" end="00:48:32.059" style="s2">you&#39;re so little that you don&#39;t have a chance and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.299" end="00:48:38.958" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s not good because you&#39;re not that little and what&#39;s arrayed against you. Isn&#39;t that big?</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.959" end="00:48:39.949" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.949" end="00:48:45.289" style="s2">It&#39;s not that it&#39;s not big because it is big but it&#39;s that you&#39;re nowhere near as little as you might have been</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.419" end="00:48:47.419" style="s2">enticed to think</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.930" end="00:48:55.700" style="s2">Exactly and I think I think what you&#39;re describing is very like I think most people hear that and would agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.830" end="00:49:03.590" style="s2">but they just selectively apply it to different people in our society like they want to tell some of us because of of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.930" end="00:49:09.469" style="s2">Circumstances that that&#39;s less true for some than others and that&#39;s what yeah. Well, that&#39;s the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.470" end="00:49:11.810" style="s2">It really makes you wonder where the true racism is</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.630" end="00:49:14.360" style="s2">Yeah, and well</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.360" end="00:49:19.339" style="s2">You know and as I as I travel around Canada and I go to other countries and I speak to young men who are in</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.650" end="00:49:25.430" style="s2">In some cases very difficult circumstances. I see over and over again how they&#39;re being denied that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.980" end="00:49:30.080" style="s2">That belief that it&#39;s they&#39;re being told that that belief is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.950" end="00:49:38.179" style="s2">Competing with recognition of unfairness. Yeah. I heard that despite John Henry ISM</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.250" end="00:49:43.010" style="s2">It&#39;s a new form of pathology identified by psychologists as the belief among</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.590" end="00:49:50.210" style="s2">Minority young men that personal effort and sacrifice and responsibility will actually produce positive outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:57.890" style="s2">It&#39;s actually for exactly the reasons that you just described because it runs counter to the victim and oppressor narrative</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:02.150" style="s2">It&#39;s actually being treated by some people now as a form of psychological disorder</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.270" end="00:50:05.270" style="s2">Wow, yeah Wow</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.550" end="00:50:13.279" style="s2">Yeah, and and and that like and and when you when you when you say those things right when you go to people who?</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.710" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">are in difficult circumstances and remind them even to some small degree that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.380" end="00:50:25.400" style="s2">individual agency might matter right that it could affect their outcome that they do not have they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.590" end="00:50:27.769" style="s2">Destined to us to a life of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.560" end="00:50:30.560" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.140" end="00:50:34.489" style="s2">There are a lot of people get it threatened by that right and they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.950" end="00:50:38.539" style="s2">You&#39;re undermining the narrative that they desperately want to be true</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.540" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">Which is that that young man has to suffer until everything else changes right that until we get rid of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.290" end="00:50:53.660" style="s2">and and patriarchy and white supremacy and all these other evils right quote-unquote evils of our society that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.940" end="00:50:55.650" style="s2">you you</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.650" end="00:50:58.400" style="s2">You you will you cannot have a good life?</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">until that is first dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.220" end="00:51:03.709" style="s2">and asking people to sit around and wait for</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.230" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.310" end="00:51:10.219" style="s2">Kind of activist class to create this utopia for them</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.770" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:17.750" style="s2">Find that to be very immoral and very bothersome because I see I see you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.750" end="00:51:25.189" style="s2">The biggest obstacles I have to getting my message out to young men are people who I would describe as you know victim celebrators</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.190" end="00:51:28.010" style="s2">Right people who really really want to celebrate when we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.770" end="00:51:34.969" style="s2">Because it fits their narrative but ideas that might help us win are a lot less attractive</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.490" end="00:51:40.459" style="s2">Yeah, yeah. Okay. So now you went off to York and and what happened when you went to York</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.100" end="00:51:49.679" style="s2">Well, I always jokingly saved my life got really boring really quickly because I really just studied and did everything I was supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:55.260" style="s2">I like I am actually surprised by how hard I was able to work in those four years</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.260" end="00:52:00.900" style="s2">I would I took all I was very careful about picking classes that I thought would build on the momentum</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.910" end="00:52:06.569" style="s2">I had picked up so I I want to study subject matter that would connect to things I previously learned</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.760" end="00:52:08.760" style="s2">Because I still had a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.340" end="00:52:13.289" style="s2">Insecurity about going too far from where I had proven myself, you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.290" end="00:52:17.669" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if I could have taken an economics class or a biology class or a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.070" end="00:52:21.749" style="s2">Psychology class because those are just subjects that didn&#39;t come that</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.750" end="00:52:26.340" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t sure I could handle so I was very careful about picking things. I thought I could do</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.340" end="00:52:31.650" style="s2">well things that in my free time I was thinking about right so issues around poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.350" end="00:52:36.539" style="s2">discrimination and activism and you know such</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.300" end="00:52:41.939" style="s2">Tackling social issues whether that was in the kind of Canadian context or elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.070" end="00:52:48.360" style="s2">Those are things that I felt comfortable with and so I picked classes that fit that mold and as I got more and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.000" end="00:52:51.479" style="s2">Confident in myself. I started to branch out into other areas</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.480" end="00:52:57.719" style="s2">so take an econ class or a class and marketing for nonprofit organizations or things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.780" end="00:52:59.980" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.980" end="00:53:01.660" style="s2">I had a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.660" end="00:53:03.899" style="s2">You know my whole life up to that point was on</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.900" end="00:53:10.469" style="s2">one Street that I that steals Avenue West which is on the north end of Toronto and</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.810" end="00:53:15.090" style="s2">You know where my mom lived Humber College and York University are all off this street</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.250" end="00:53:19.080" style="s2">So my world was very small in the sense that the same bus routes</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.080" end="00:53:24.539" style="s2">I had taken as a teenager were the same bus as I took to Homer and the same bus as I took to York</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.540" end="00:53:29.610" style="s2">I I got very much in a comfort zone there, right because I was saying to myself, okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.220" end="00:53:34.860" style="s2">This is the world. I know this is the world. I understand I can be successful in this world</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.860" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">And so I clung to it and I didn&#39;t really do much to branch out</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:45.869" style="s2">You know, I still worked in restaurants as a line cook and a dishwasher. I worked in warehouses even when I was getting aids</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.870" end="00:53:53.370" style="s2">I didn&#39;t think for instance to apply to like a prestigious internship or to work at your you wouldn&#39;t have known on that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.370" end="00:53:56.939" style="s2">You know, like when you come from about like that, it&#39;s you know when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.730" end="00:54:03.270" style="s2">University of Alberta, I didn&#39;t know any people who had had a graduate degree. I didn&#39;t know how to go about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.270" end="00:54:06.810" style="s2">And so the idea that I could do that was really something that was quite new</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.210" end="00:54:12.990" style="s2">You don&#39;t know the pathways, you know, I mean you can figure them out. But if that&#39;s not right in your mill, you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.660" end="00:54:18.120" style="s2">You just don&#39;t know how II don&#39;t know what basic steps to take. You don&#39;t exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.000" end="00:54:21.360" style="s2">There was this idea I came across</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.060" end="00:54:24.060" style="s2">in in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.370" end="00:54:26.370" style="s2">international development classes I took</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.920" end="00:54:30.300" style="s2">But it&#39;s an anthropology concept called the capacity to aspire</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.060" end="00:54:32.920" style="s2">from Arjun Appadurai</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.920" end="00:54:34.920" style="s2">NYU and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.320" end="00:54:42.509" style="s2">It stuck with me because he uses it to explain how people achieve social mobility in India and I think it applied really well</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.120" end="00:54:46.890" style="s2">to my life in Canada too, which is you know your</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:51.300" style="s2">Imagination grows with with the more paths as you see in front of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.310" end="00:54:57.090" style="s2">And we all might have a similar destination in mind in terms of what a good life looks like, right?</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.090" end="00:54:59.090" style="s2">I want a better house a better car</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.170" end="00:55:01.170" style="s2">Someone who loves me someone to love</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.320" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">but some of us have a better sense of the directions the steps it takes to get to that destination than others and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.100" end="00:55:11.909" style="s2">And that idea stuck with me because it helped explain</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.370" end="00:55:19.409" style="s2">Both the difference between myself and some of my peers in university who were more accustomed to opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.540" end="00:55:22.080" style="s2">but it also explained the difference between me and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.270" end="00:55:26.699" style="s2">My friends who were not in university and we&#39;re not making some of the good choices</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.700" end="00:55:31.560" style="s2">I was and we&#39;re still dealing with the consequences of how we grew up</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.560" end="00:55:31.740" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.740" end="00:55:38.939" style="s2">I have this program that I developed with my colleagues called Future authoring program that helps people make a develop a vision for their life</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.370" end="00:55:42.569" style="s2">along some of the dimensions you mentioned but then and then also to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.870" end="00:55:50.579" style="s2">Put together an implementable strategy and we&#39;ve never been able to tell if the utility of the program lies more in</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.950" end="00:55:57.870" style="s2">walking people through an actual the actual process of developing a vision and a genuine strategy or</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:02.220" style="s2">Suggesting to people that they&#39;re actually capable of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.800" end="00:56:05.699" style="s2">Hmm, right, so and I often think it&#39;s the latter</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.700" end="00:56:08.610" style="s2">It&#39;s like because the the idea that you are</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.100" end="00:56:11.609" style="s2">Self-transforming agent is an unbelievably powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.740" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:17.550" style="s2">If you could if if it grips you right or if you allow it to grip you that might be another way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.550" end="00:56:18.850" style="s2">it but</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.850" end="00:56:25.559" style="s2">but but it it is certainly an idea that you cannot have or that you can be prematurely cynical about which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.720" end="00:56:32.189" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s that that premature cynicism is really what the victim that narrative feeds and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.310" end="00:56:34.450" style="s2">mentally</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.450" end="00:56:37.590" style="s2">Damaging to two young people. It really hurts them</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.780" end="00:56:38.280" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.280" end="00:56:40.140" style="s2">So you went to York and you did real well</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.140" end="00:56:45.629" style="s2">And then how did the idea of Law School pop into your mind and and then you have encouragement for that?</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.630" end="00:56:49.320" style="s2">I mean you had to go write the LSAT and all of this. It&#39;s quite a daunting process</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.960" end="00:56:51.580" style="s2">it is I</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.580" end="00:56:54.539" style="s2">it was actually a very practical decision for me because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.730" end="00:57:00.959" style="s2">Looked around and saw that no one who studied what I studied at York was getting a job in the field and in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:06.210" style="s2">Were working the same jobs after they graduated that they had when they were a student</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.520" end="00:57:09.570" style="s2">So I thought to myself I need more education</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.790" end="00:57:11.250" style="s2">Like I lost you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.250" end="00:57:14.070" style="s2">I felt like I had given up a lot to get to that point</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.070" end="00:57:19.379" style="s2">Like I I lost a lot of the friends I grew up with I worked really really hard. I</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.560" end="00:57:22.590" style="s2">changed my life in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.750" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">felt like betting on myself and I was starting to become nervous that the bet might not pay off if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.950" end="00:57:34.649" style="s2">22 at the university degree and no job, but I have a bunch of debt, right? And so</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.040" end="00:57:40.320" style="s2">law school and business school were the things that I thought about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.570" end="00:57:45.989" style="s2">their playing on some of my strengths in the sense that I can read and write well, but they seemed very</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.870" end="00:57:51.750" style="s2">practical and that they lead to a job like theirs they&#39;re supposed to prepare you for actual work and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.180" end="00:57:56.909" style="s2">I wound up writing the law school admissions test first of the two and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.190" end="00:58:03.300" style="s2">I I did really well kind of shockingly to be honest. I did not expect to do so well</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.910" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">It was the first standardized test I had ever done well on and I was just you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.120" end="00:58:13.950" style="s2">and and I it to the point where I did not write the business school test because I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.380" end="00:58:16.380" style="s2">Like didn&#39;t want to test my luck</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.630" end="00:58:20.310" style="s2">I just thought okay like take what take what you can get, you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.230" end="00:58:22.890" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.890" end="00:58:28.700" style="s2">Because my whole life was on Steeles Avenue West I was expecting to go to the law school at York</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.700" end="00:58:33.439" style="s2">Like that was just it fit where I was comfortable. I knew what bus I would take to get there</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:35.869" style="s2">You know the the the limited</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.110" end="00:58:43.279" style="s2">Set of experiences I had made like even going to University of Toronto seemed like a foreign world to me. I</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.640" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">The idea of going downtown was like this is just not a place where people like me should be hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.840" end="00:58:50.809" style="s2">I just didn&#39;t feel comfortable there, you know, and so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.420" end="00:58:54.649" style="s2">Thought I was gonna apply to York and if I had been admitted there</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:59.509" style="s2">luckily, I would have definitely gone but I had this like chance meeting with a</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.060" end="00:59:02.060" style="s2">history professor David blight</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.520" end="00:59:09.979" style="s2">He yelled where I was speak. There&#39;s a town in southern Ontario called Buxton North Buxton, which was founded by</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.370" end="00:59:14.450" style="s2">families who came to Canada from the Underground Railroad and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.030" end="00:59:18.739" style="s2">They host a conference every year at one of the churches that they set up</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.870" end="00:59:22.190" style="s2">So I was presenting some research I had done on black Canadians</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.860" end="00:59:26.509" style="s2">At this conference and the CL professor. Who was the keynote?</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.850" end="00:59:32.089" style="s2">showed up early enough to hear my presentation and after I was done he walked over to me and he said well</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.090" end="00:59:36.350" style="s2">That was really good. What are you gonna do after graduation? And I said to him. Oh, I I wrote the ELSA</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.350" end="00:59:37.770" style="s2">I think I&#39;m gonna go to law school</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.770" end="00:59:40.940" style="s2">he said to me you should apply to Yale and I thought like</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.160" end="00:59:47.029" style="s2">This guy was a super hero to me because he was teaching at a university that I&#39;d only seen on television, you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.030" end="00:59:51.229" style="s2">Yeah, and so in my mind it was like I said Tim like are you sure like?</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.230" end="00:59:56.690" style="s2">And he was like tell me you know, he&#39;s like, yeah, I think you&#39;d be a competitive applicant and I was like, wow, so</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.730" end="00:59:58.710" style="s2">Yeah Wow</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.710" end="01:00:04.579" style="s2">Yeah, like hit his belief in me in that chance interaction where I&#39;ve never seen him since like it</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.740" end="01:00:06.950" style="s2">But we only interacted for a couple of minutes</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.950" end="01:00:08.950" style="s2">But that meant so much</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.000" end="01:00:15.320" style="s2">that I thought wow if this guy thinks that I have that ability I might as well apply to Harvard and Columbia and all these</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.320" end="01:00:20.239" style="s2">Other schools because I mean he knows what he&#39;s talking about, right? He&#39;s this like superhero from Yale</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:24.920" style="s2">And so I apply everywhere and I get in everywhere Jesus that must have been a shock</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.650" end="01:00:31.400" style="s2">Yeah, it was like winning the lottery like I just yeah. Nope. I&#39;m high. I was yeah. Hi. I</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.760" end="01:00:38.189" style="s2">And like, you know and then being able to tell my mom that not only did I get into those schools, but you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.190" end="01:00:41.700" style="s2">they&#39;re generous financial aid policies would mean that we would actually be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.220" end="01:00:45.689" style="s2">Afford it meaning we wouldn&#39;t have to pay anything because we have no money</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.150" end="01:00:49.590" style="s2">Was it like she I think like everything</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.590" end="01:00:53.279" style="s2">she ever wanted for me came true in that moment, you know and and it was a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.460" end="01:01:00.600" style="s2">Yeah, it was just a special special day. Yeah, no kidding. That&#39;s quite that that&#39;s quite the miraculous situation. That is men</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.300" end="01:01:09.060" style="s2">Yeah, and and it&#39;s one where I say to myself very lucky and fortunate to be able to have walk down that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.060" end="01:01:12.810" style="s2">Well brave too, man. You did do the applications you put in, New York</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.810" end="01:01:17.999" style="s2">That&#39;s you know, like there&#39;s good fortune there for sure, but it&#39;s not like it just it&#39;s not a lottery</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.130" end="01:01:23.309" style="s2">Well, it is in a sense you but you bought lots of tickets and you that&#39;s true. Yeah, yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.310" end="01:01:27.449" style="s2">Okay. Yeah, you gotta buy a lot of tickets to it. That&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.450" end="01:01:33.179" style="s2">That&#39;s right that&#39;s right now and and you know as I described, you know the bet I made on myself it paid off, right?</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.180" end="01:01:35.220" style="s2">I mean the idea that I would ever be</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.590" end="01:01:40.649" style="s2">like I I now would have an education where I could choose the job I had and I wouldn&#39;t just be</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.280" end="01:01:44.310" style="s2">Given whatever was available to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.310" end="01:01:48.539" style="s2">I mean that is really what I was looking for right like that kind of stability where I could say</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.580" end="01:01:54.479" style="s2">I&#39;m an employable person the financial challenges my modeling through I will not have to go through and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.670" end="01:01:58.860" style="s2">I might even be able to do something for her and other people right? No kidding</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.860" end="01:02:06.029" style="s2">There&#39;s someone that&#39;s what attending Yale met for me. Okay, so so now then then he went to Yale. How&#39;d you do at Yale? I</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.240" end="01:02:10.169" style="s2">Did well I had a different kind of experience though, you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.170" end="01:02:15.750" style="s2">like I I really killed myself for four years studying at York to get there and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.570" end="01:02:21.149" style="s2">Part of the appeal for Yale to me was you know, I had read those stories by you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.150" end="01:02:24.060" style="s2">Bill Clinton where while he was getting a law degree?</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.060" end="01:02:27.330" style="s2">He was actually living in New York or Arkansas or in London</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.330" end="01:02:35.080" style="s2">like Yale was a place where if you didn&#39;t want academics to be your primary focus you could be doing other thing and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.810" end="01:02:39.190" style="s2">because the grading system is generous and because the culture there is</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.070" end="01:02:43.150" style="s2">Encouraging of you to kind of be impactful in whatever way</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:46.689" style="s2">you can be and so I</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.540" end="01:02:51.249" style="s2">It was a very alien environment to me and I and I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.250" end="01:02:54.670" style="s2">I look back and I think some of that bravery you just credited me with them</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.670" end="01:02:57.879" style="s2">I feel like maybe I was a little less brave there because I</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.340" end="01:03:01.960" style="s2">Really didn&#39;t feel comfortable there in a way that I never got used to</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.080" end="01:03:08.769" style="s2">Being around wealthy people was really hard for me in terms of just feeling inadequate all the time. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.770" end="01:03:13.030" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s one of the problems with those Ivy League schools is that you know what? It&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.640" end="01:03:14.780" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.780" end="01:03:17.890" style="s2">Almost everyone who ends up at one of those schools feels inadequate</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.650" end="01:03:22.629" style="s2">At least on one dimension right because no matter how rich you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.630" end="01:03:28.089" style="s2">There&#39;s someone richer and if you&#39;re rich, you&#39;re not as smart as your roommate and if you&#39;re as smart as your roommate</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.090" end="01:03:34.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not as smart as your professor and like they&#39;re very weird institutions because they aggregate people who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.910" end="01:03:41.259" style="s2">Remarkable across a number of dimensions and so everyone who attends them tends to feel well like they have impostor syndrome</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.420" end="01:03:44.319" style="s2">I really noticed that among the undergraduates at Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.810" end="01:03:49.150" style="s2">Because there used to be in the smartest kids in their classes and then when they&#39;d show up at Harvard, you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.340" end="01:03:50.930" style="s2">They were no longer</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.930" end="01:03:53.859" style="s2">Guaranteed to be the smartest person in the room. That&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.770" end="01:03:58.930" style="s2">yeah, I think that that&#39;s exactly what I observed that you know, I mean thankfully for me I</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.570" end="01:04:06.309" style="s2">Feel before so I wasn&#39;t too worried about getting a bad grade, you know, like that wasn&#39;t really the concern for me</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.310" end="01:04:13.720" style="s2">What more so was the concern was I really felt uncomfortable with what I saw is like privileged. Right? Like I&#39;m I I I</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.630" end="01:04:18.430" style="s2">in some ways felt like in danger of being a sellout right of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.070" end="01:04:21.640" style="s2">being someone who grew up with very little and</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.070" end="01:04:26.080" style="s2">Then being welcomed with open arms by this like opulent</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.300" end="01:04:30.789" style="s2">Institution that was surrounded by people who were living like I used to right</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.790" end="01:04:33.670" style="s2">I mean the neighborhoods around Yale. Right, right</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.670" end="01:04:39.879" style="s2">you know particularly particularly striking that way and absolutely yeah, and so, you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.880" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">I would walk around campus and walk out of campus and I would see that you men</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.510" end="01:04:50.679" style="s2">living like I used to live would be stopped by Yale security all the time or would be treated in a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.410" end="01:04:57.490" style="s2">Hostile way anytime they came too close to some of the Yale buildings and it just you know it</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.710" end="01:05:00.250" style="s2">I was really unsure what to do with them</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.310" end="01:05:09.249" style="s2">do you do you embrace that do you just start sucking up to the professors and become, you know part of that scene or</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.040" end="01:05:15.550" style="s2">Is there another way and I I spent three years trying to figure that out and I&#39;m not sure I really did</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.040" end="01:05:18.310" style="s2">What part of how I reconciled it?</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.310" end="01:05:24.279" style="s2">All was I took a I was part of a project where you could work as a volunteer high school teacher</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.910" end="01:05:31.690" style="s2">In some of the local neighborhoods and so I used to teach constitutional law to grade 11 and grade 12 kids</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.030" end="01:05:37.959" style="s2">Some of the rougher high schools and that was my way of feeling like whatever Yale was giving me</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.960" end="01:05:43.149" style="s2">I was immediately trying to give it back to somebody else. I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t know how else to to</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.460" end="01:05:47.830" style="s2">Well, that seems like a good that seems like a good approach. How did that work out for you?</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.710" end="01:05:53.320" style="s2">Um, well it worked out. Well in the sense that I did get a lot of you know unique and</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.080" end="01:05:58.539" style="s2">Amazing opportunities as a Yale student and I did I think have the chance</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.790" end="01:06:01.600" style="s2">To be useful to a lot of other people at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.940" end="01:06:07.960" style="s2">so the balance I think I was able to strike it but I certainly look back and think you know they were if I was</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.960" end="01:06:11.500" style="s2">a little bit more prepared if I knew people who could have</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.290" end="01:06:15.370" style="s2">Introduced me and oriented me to that environment. I think I could have</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.250" end="01:06:21.070" style="s2">Gotten more out of it in the sense that I would have known what actually mattered like you spend</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.320" end="01:06:23.769" style="s2">just as you met you described that that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.160" end="01:06:31.210" style="s2">collection of remarkable people who&#39;ve done so many things part of how they cope with their</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.450" end="01:06:35.200" style="s2">inadequacies or their feelings of inadequacy is</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.660" end="01:06:37.899" style="s2">They they are so prone to groupthink</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.940" end="01:06:40.179" style="s2">right because the way you deal with</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.280" end="01:06:47.140" style="s2">feeling inadequate is to just try to be like everyone else but better right and so you wind up in this like like like for</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.140" end="01:06:48.010" style="s2">Example Yale</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.010" end="01:06:55.840" style="s2">Um prides itself on the diversity of its student body coming into an entering law school class, right? So</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.490" end="01:06:57.210" style="s2">all the different schools</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.210" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">they went to and their</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:02.369" style="s2">Experiences and the countries they&#39;ve worked in and all that and yet more than half of Yale</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.470" end="01:07:08.580" style="s2">students will have the same job when they graduate they&#39;ll be law clerks working for a fancy judge some sure and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.650" end="01:07:14.879" style="s2">Most of those people will then go on to work at a fancy law firm. And so it is this this process where</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.460" end="01:07:17.669" style="s2">If you come in from a different place</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.490" end="01:07:24.030" style="s2">And you try to resist the groupthink. You&#39;re going to inevitably graduate feeling like you missed out because</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.430" end="01:07:28.500" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be reminded of all the amazing things your classmates are doing and you&#39;re not sure if</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.110" end="01:07:33.929" style="s2">Walking a different path is gonna pay off for you, right you&#39;re thinking to yourself. Well, I didn&#39;t take that clerkship</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.930" end="01:07:37.889" style="s2">I didn&#39;t take the job at the fancy law firm in Manhattan</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.800" end="01:07:41.369" style="s2">Am I gonna kick myself for that for the rest of my life?</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.369" end="01:07:47.579" style="s2">And that was what was weighing on my mind that graduated like I was so stressed out because I was like am I gonna regret?</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.710" end="01:07:53.639" style="s2">How I played this hand, you know, okay. So what happened what I want to talk a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.250" end="01:07:58.949" style="s2">About what happened after you left Yale you ended up at Tory&#39;s eventually</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.500" end="01:08:06.479" style="s2">But because I articled there but I also wanted to turn the topic to something slightly darker as well. I mean you&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.480" end="01:08:09.480" style="s2">been suffering from a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.450" end="01:08:11.830" style="s2">What would you call it?</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.830" end="01:08:12.790" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.790" end="01:08:15.479" style="s2">I&#39;m burdensome illness for the last year</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.640" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">burdensome and terrifying illness for the last year and I wanted to touch on that at least a little bit because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.240" end="01:08:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.900" end="01:08:32.310" style="s2">Second part to the story that you just told right because you you emerged from a very desperate</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.069" end="01:08:34.569" style="s2">initial orientation</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.569" end="01:08:39.298" style="s2">To a degree of remarkable success. I would say academically and</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.850" end="01:08:42.539" style="s2">Practically and then you got walloped, you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.540" end="01:08:48.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;ve done all this work and you&#39;ve put yourself together and you&#39;ve helped put the world right and you&#39;ve changed your attitude and</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.810" end="01:08:51.180" style="s2">Then all of a sudden when things are going well for you</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.190" end="01:08:55.710" style="s2">You know you get you get cut down and I&#39;m I want to go back to that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.710" end="01:09:00.689" style="s2">I want to go to that and because I&#39;m curious about how how you&#39;re coping with that and how you&#39;re managing it</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.690" end="01:09:03.629" style="s2">But let&#39;s talk about what happened after you left Yale first</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.410" end="01:09:13.410" style="s2">Well when I left DL I just I tried to work in the corporate world and do the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.680" end="01:09:16.680" style="s2">community service and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:20.069" style="s2">kind of activist work that I was really passionate about because</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.650" end="01:09:24.450" style="s2">Canada is a hard country. I mean one of the biggest differences I would say between</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.480" end="01:09:30.209" style="s2">Coming back here after graduation versus staying in the u.s. Is where you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.299" end="01:09:36.839" style="s2">Create a career for yourself. There&#39;s just a lot more options in the joints to me a professional</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.020" end="01:09:41.459" style="s2">Advocate for youth or to work on some of the issues we&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.010" end="01:09:45.479" style="s2">At a research center or to do you know this and that in Canada?</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.480" end="01:09:52.169" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s if there&#39;s there&#39;s few options. A lot of them are government oriented, which is something I&#39;ve always been a bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:55.470" style="s2">cautious of I&#39;m not a big fan of how</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.980" end="01:10:02.970" style="s2">Top-down a lot of Canada works because of the the power our governments have and so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.180" end="01:10:06.629" style="s2">had a hard time feeling like I fit in so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.790" end="01:10:13.740" style="s2">The the way I thought would work best for me the honourable way to approach that problem in my mind was I&#39;ll earn I&#39;ll earn</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.740" end="01:10:15.400" style="s2">my keep with a</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.400" end="01:10:18.839" style="s2">management consulting job or a corporate law job and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.060" end="01:10:25.620" style="s2">work with youth and work with police officers to change policies and things like that on the weekends and in the evenings and</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.750" end="01:10:27.780" style="s2">I did that for a couple of years and it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.360" end="01:10:36.060" style="s2">Exhausting. I mean it was hard to do everything and I wound up taking a job teaching at York University because I thought it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.060" end="01:10:38.819" style="s2">A way for me to do those things. I was passionate about full time</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.550" end="01:10:42.840" style="s2">I found out as I&#39;m sure you know that</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.780" end="01:10:50.129" style="s2">Universities also are not places that you get to always focus on being useful to other people</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.250" end="01:10:56.069" style="s2">you know the work I wanted to do I had a hard time balancing with the expectations of</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.530" end="01:11:00.089" style="s2">playing up to kind of the university politics and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.730" end="01:11:08.010" style="s2">You know see, you know doing research that I or or being tempted to do research. I didn&#39;t think would actually be helpful to anyone</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.860" end="01:11:15.569" style="s2">and being part of academic pursuits that I don&#39;t think are immediately relevant to people in our society who</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.320" end="01:11:19.530" style="s2">would benefit most from quality research and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.110" end="01:11:25.530" style="s2">It was hard to balance all those things - and I was in the process of figuring all that out. I supposed when I got</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.110" end="01:11:30.210" style="s2">Diagnosed with cancer I spent at that point. I was a couple of years into teaching and</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.930" end="01:11:37.530" style="s2">It happened at a time where I was already hoping to kind of rethink what I would be doing with my career because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.530" end="01:11:39.749" style="s2">Feel like university life was the long-term</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.390" end="01:11:41.770" style="s2">solution for me</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.770" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">and then cancer hit me and it&#39;s given me a lot of time to I guess like reflect on that and think about what I</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:49.450" style="s2">Want to be doing when I get healthy again?</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.450" end="01:11:55.799" style="s2">So yeah, so you so you have stage 4 non-hodgkins lymphoma</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.190" end="01:12:01.560" style="s2">Yes, and that also caused spinal fractures. So it&#39;s really quite the</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:09.720" style="s2">Catastrophic mix of of symptoms and that that that&#39;s been that&#39;s been you&#39;ve been being treated for that since last February</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:16.289" style="s2">So the first question is, how did you find? What were the symptoms that led to your diagnosis? And how did you find?</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.290" end="01:12:18.290" style="s2">How did you find out what what was wrong?</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.760" end="01:12:25.019" style="s2">Yeah, well, you know, I you know, one of the things people say about men is that we don&#39;t seek help</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.730" end="01:12:33.299" style="s2">I&#39;m I guess I might be an example of that because you know, I had pain in my neck for months</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.090" end="01:12:40.710" style="s2">And and in my lower back or my and I just like didn&#39;t, you know take it seriously. I just thought alright</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.710" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">Well, I just turned 13. I thought maybe this is what 30 spike. You know, you got yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:49.200" style="s2">Yeah and back problems. And yeah, well you never you&#39;d never leap right to the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:52.320" style="s2">Yeah, so I wound up</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.080" end="01:12:57.390" style="s2">going into the hospital to get it looked at and I also had a</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.090" end="01:12:59.890" style="s2">soul and lymph nodes</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.890" end="01:13:05.039" style="s2">which I also didn&#39;t take seriously because I just thought like how you know, it&#39;s not a big deal and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.890" end="01:13:10.950" style="s2">turns out those things are related because in the the lymph nodes on my left side is</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.140" end="01:13:14.280" style="s2">Where a tumor had started to grow and that tumor?</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.070" end="01:13:20.250" style="s2">Or and that the cancer aren&#39;t spreading from that main tumor into some of my bonus</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:22.860" style="s2">and the neck pain and back pain I was feeling</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.680" end="01:13:25.680" style="s2">Were caused by the cancer cracked</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.290" end="01:13:28.290" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.370" end="01:13:30.680" style="s2">Two parts of my spine one in the neck and one in the back</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.720" end="01:13:36.379" style="s2">So I wound up at an emergency room visit which I thought was going to be fairly, you know, simple</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.380" end="01:13:38.150" style="s2">I thought you know, I didn&#39;t have a doctor</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.150" end="01:13:41.629" style="s2">So I went to the emergency room thinking I was gonna get antibiotics</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.030" end="01:13:48.499" style="s2">Prescribed to me for the lymph nodes being swollen and I wound up being held for a week because they had to do a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.500" end="01:13:53.300" style="s2">Of testing on what was going on and that&#39;s how I basically found out about camps about the cancer</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.300" end="01:13:58.099" style="s2">I was at a pretty high risk of paralysis at that point because of</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.350" end="01:14:02.390" style="s2">The injury and the possibility of the spinal cord being affected</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.270" end="01:14:07.910" style="s2">Thankfully that didn&#39;t happen and in a weird way my bones wound up kind of fusing together</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.130" end="01:14:13.370" style="s2">So they&#39;re never gonna be normal again, but they&#39;re stable enough that I won&#39;t have those problems at least</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.190" end="01:14:19.310" style="s2">but then I went through like chemo and radiation for most of the last ten months and I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.380" end="01:14:23.150" style="s2">Couple months ago. I finished that up and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.730" end="01:14:25.500" style="s2">It&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.500" end="01:14:31.910" style="s2">It&#39;s been intense. I think I revisited a lot of the the harmful places that my mind used to be when I was younger</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.520" end="01:14:34.820" style="s2">the temptation to be like resentful</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.160" end="01:14:35.670" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.670" end="01:14:36.290" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.290" end="01:14:42.379" style="s2">I put a lot work into my career and to have this happen in prime kind of earning years</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.750" end="01:14:50.090" style="s2">To have my income cut drastically when you&#39;re the by far the biggest breadwinner and your family the first one to finish</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.550" end="01:14:52.999" style="s2">University and first one to become a professional</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.850" end="01:14:55.260" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.260" end="01:14:59.959" style="s2">I and I and there was a part of me that really wanted to go back to that place where I would just see myself</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.960" end="01:15:04.220" style="s2">as a victim and be angry at everybody and be angry at God and be angry at</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.950" end="01:15:06.950" style="s2">life for</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.990" end="01:15:08.670" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.670" end="01:15:14.090" style="s2">Yeah, the problem with that is that then you end up with the illness and being angry at God and at life</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.120" end="01:15:22.700" style="s2">yeah, you know which which like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like I&#39;m making light of your motivation for feeling that way because you know that</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.700" end="01:15:25.189" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a hell of a thing to have happen and</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.980" end="01:15:27.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.450" end="01:15:34.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a blow that would destabilize anyone and the fact that you started revisiting that same dark places is</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.310" end="01:15:38.030" style="s2">Anything but surprising, you know, I think what&#39;s surprising</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.670" end="01:15:40.670" style="s2">Mostly is that you didn&#39;t stay there?</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.510" end="01:15:47.349" style="s2">Yeah, but watch if you really ill people, you know, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really bad to have the illness</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.389" end="01:15:50.949" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure and it can be ultimately bad but</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.559" end="01:15:57.279" style="s2">to also have that in bitter you and bring back your cynicism and</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.530" end="01:16:00.159" style="s2">Make you not so much desperate as as</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.190" end="01:16:03.050" style="s2">rage-filled and angry</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.050" end="01:16:08.829" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t help the illness and all it does is make your situation worse and I think worse for everyone around you as well</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.829" end="01:16:14.079" style="s2">that&#39;s also something terrible about being sick is that you tend to feel like you&#39;re a like a an</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.780" end="01:16:20.469" style="s2">Intolerable burden on the people around you as well. It&#39;s another bit of guilt. You have to bear along with being ill</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.889" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">yeah, I think that&#39;s absolutely right and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.110" end="01:16:29.229" style="s2">That that that that dark place</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.610" end="01:16:39.339" style="s2">Was was tempting for a lot of reasons but but one of which was it just made it made it, you know being sick</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.340" end="01:16:44.739" style="s2">It&#39;s like you have no one to get mad at right. It&#39;s like who&#39;s the face of that, right? Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.349" end="01:16:52.839" style="s2">You want to find someone to blame like you want to have something to point to and say this is the cause of my misfortune</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.360" end="01:16:57.369" style="s2">And it&#39;s not like I had you know lung cancer or something where it&#39;s like, oh, you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.369" end="01:17:00.308" style="s2">I smoked too much or I have some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.039" end="01:17:04.929" style="s2">Behavior I could associate with being ill I mean when the doctor told me I was sick</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.929" end="01:17:09.998" style="s2">She said to me, you know, I asked her like how is it possible that I&#39;m this sick? I don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.999" end="01:17:16.359" style="s2">I have no problems and she said you know, it&#39;s just bad luck. Yeah, that&#39;s a hard and um stupidity of life</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.059" end="01:17:19.089" style="s2">Yeah, and I think that&#39;s a hard thing to accept</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.729" end="01:17:20.900" style="s2">For sure</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.900" end="01:17:27.159" style="s2">But what it also did was just kind of like there was a there was a message that I needed to hear from people</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.590" end="01:17:32.199" style="s2">When I was getting out of a dark place when I was younger right when I was getting out of high school</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.329" end="01:17:34.329" style="s2">I needed people to believe in me</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.329" end="01:17:38.799" style="s2">I need people to think I had a brighter future than I thought. I might have I needed people who</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:42.909" style="s2">Still have that like an unwavering faith that I could be</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.579" end="01:17:45.349" style="s2">helpful to the world and</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.349" end="01:17:51.248" style="s2">when I when I got diagnosed I needed that stent like I needed that just as bad like I needed that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.349" end="01:17:54.549" style="s2">From people that you&#39;re not just dislike burden</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.210" end="01:18:00.399" style="s2">Now your mom has to stress about you and it&#39;s not like she doesn&#39;t already have a whole bunch of things to worry about</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.760" end="01:18:02.120" style="s2">It&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.120" end="01:18:07.689" style="s2">Despite this illness you still have a lot to offer the world and people who had that message</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.690" end="01:18:09.690" style="s2">I mean, you&#39;re one of them you sent me an email</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.700" end="01:18:12.849" style="s2">thanks to a mutual friend shortly after I got</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.490" end="01:18:15.410" style="s2">diagnosed and</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.410" end="01:18:19.990" style="s2">It matters, right it matters when people say to you that, you know, as you said earlier</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.990" end="01:18:25.629" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a call to action that you&#39;ve got a you&#39;ve got as you know, a personal catastrophe now that</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.150" end="01:18:31.030" style="s2">You have to deal with and in doing so you&#39;re gonna learn a lot about yourself and what you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.300" end="01:18:36.189" style="s2">just you talk to write a book on capacity to aspire, you know, and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.040" end="01:18:41.260" style="s2">the idea that you should battle on against insuperable odds is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.630" end="01:18:46.810" style="s2">In some sense an idea that it&#39;s got a certain amount of hopelessness about it under some</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:49.629" style="s2">circumstances because there are times when you battle and</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.240" end="01:18:54.819" style="s2">you lose and it&#39;s even the case that you lose if you battle as</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.880" end="01:19:02.350" style="s2">Forthrightly and courageously as you possibly can but the truth of the matter is is that there isn&#39;t a better strategy</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.930" end="01:19:04.930" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.540" end="01:19:06.280" style="s2">first of all</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.280" end="01:19:11.499" style="s2">the strategy works most of the time or if any strategy is going to work that&#39;s going to be the one and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.840" end="01:19:17.080" style="s2">Nothing is certain in life. And so not every strategy ever works a hundred percent of the time, but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.750" end="01:19:21.640" style="s2">The best you have and you you you decided</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:29.290" style="s2">Apparently to rescue yourself from the second descent into the hole of hell despair. Let&#39;s say to</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.870" end="01:19:34.089" style="s2">Continue to try to aspire forward despite the fact that you&#39;d been thrown another</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.610" end="01:19:36.610" style="s2">tremendous obstacle</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.650" end="01:19:39.970" style="s2">Yeah, well, what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s been really good for me is</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.570" end="01:19:48.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve really focused on being around people who have their own challenges, you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.130" end="01:19:48.620" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.620" end="01:19:54.459" style="s2">I credit a lot of the young men I&#39;ve spent time with since my book come out for putting my mind in a place that</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.460" end="01:19:57.100" style="s2">Was actually positive and productive, you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.100" end="01:19:59.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent time with boys who are going through the challenges</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.530" end="01:20:06.069" style="s2">I had when I was a kid far worse in many circumstances. I spent time people who are fighting poverty or abuse</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.740" end="01:20:09.599" style="s2">kids who are in the foster system kids who have</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.150" end="01:20:11.940" style="s2">Not even a mom that I was a Boston</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.940" end="01:20:14.909" style="s2">Alright and and being around those young men</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:20.130" style="s2">Young men who&#39;ve come out of jail and are trying to do something different young men. Who who who are</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.409" end="01:20:22.409" style="s2">figuring how to grow up on on</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.540" end="01:20:26.129" style="s2">The spot because they now have a kid they have to be worried about right</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.130" end="01:20:32.580" style="s2">I mean being around those young men in every city I&#39;ve been able to travel to has has really made it hard for me to</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.010" end="01:20:36.659" style="s2">Feel sorry for myself and also hard for me to discount what?</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.659" end="01:20:43.529" style="s2">You know, I don&#39;t know where my physical health goes from here. I&#39;m still not you know in remission yet, but</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.230" end="01:20:46.230" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard for me to</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.300" end="01:20:49.440" style="s2">Put myself at the center of a victim narrative</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.440" end="01:20:55.919" style="s2">Which I know is tempting and I&#39;ve talked to other cancer patients who are similarly tempted to look that at life that way</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.020" end="01:20:59.879" style="s2">And to say there&#39;s still a bunch of young men who I could be useful to</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.880" end="01:21:05.489" style="s2">Yeah, and the idea that I might say something to a guy who just got out of jail or a guy who?</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.070" end="01:21:08.489" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t think he can be a good student or a guy who?</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.580" end="01:21:14.729" style="s2">you know is in a university where he feels in over his head and that maybe I could say something that could</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.890" end="01:21:18.899" style="s2">change how he thinks about himself and put his best foot forward like</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.090" end="01:21:25.949" style="s2">That&#39;s been that&#39;s been worth living for quite honestly and that makes the cancer feel so irrelevant by comparison</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.180" end="01:21:33.059" style="s2">Yeah, well that&#39;s a hell of a thing to have accomplished as far as I&#39;m concerned but I think it&#39;s dead right</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.580" end="01:21:38.189" style="s2">You know, I mean life is a hopeless business and we all die in the end that question is, what do you do?</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.470" end="01:21:40.470" style="s2">what do you do in the interim and</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.170" end="01:21:43.170" style="s2">everything that you can do to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.480" end="01:21:47.669" style="s2">Put things in a more positive place is is a credit to your integrity</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.130" end="01:21:53.130" style="s2">Fundamentally and it&#39;s integrally associated with the meaning that does sustain you in very dark times</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.770" end="01:21:59.719" style="s2">Absolutely, and I think that you know the confidence that I had in</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.720" end="01:22:06.170" style="s2">You know individual agency and personal responsibility in the power of how you choose to think</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.810" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">About the world and how you interpret the adversity you go through the confidence</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.840" end="01:22:17.659" style="s2">I had in that from growing up and from the academic research I&#39;ve done and the life I lived has only grown</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.850" end="01:22:23.600" style="s2">Exponentially since I&#39;ve been sick because I now see it in my own life on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.600" end="01:22:25.610" style="s2">but I also get to see it in people who are</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.280" end="01:22:30.110" style="s2">Facing far more severe physical challenges than I have people</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.110" end="01:22:36.349" style="s2">Who should I share a hospital room with four people who I see when I walk, you know through the Cancer Center</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.930" end="01:22:40.760" style="s2">And it&#39;s like and I see what they have to tell themselves</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:44.210" style="s2">the you know the rules they have to live by to</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.760" end="01:22:45.810" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.810" end="01:22:53.600" style="s2">to get through the the challenges they face on a day-to-day basis and get to somewhere positive and constructive and</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.320" end="01:23:01.130" style="s2">That&#39;s you know, it&#39;s incredibly inspirational and it&#39;s and it certainly makes it meet, you know, frankly the limited patients</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.130" end="01:23:07.730" style="s2">I had four people who undermine or want to downplay the importance of that that way of looking at life and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.070" end="01:23:08.910" style="s2">that way of</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.910" end="01:23:14.630" style="s2">Orienting yourself to the world that patience is far thinner than it was before and it wasn&#39;t like I was very tolerant of that</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.970" end="01:23:16.970" style="s2">You know before I got sick either</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.459" end="01:23:23.309" style="s2">Well, you know it seems to me that that&#39;s probably a pretty good time to</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.010" end="01:23:29.099" style="s2">Bring this discussion to a close. What do you think? What else? Is there anything else that you have to tell people?</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.099" end="01:23:35.188" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;m kind of curious about how you had the opportunity to talk to all these young men or how you&#39;ve taken that opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.610" end="01:23:41.249" style="s2">Well, a lot of it has been, you know people who read the book and want me to come speak to</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.099" end="01:23:44.099" style="s2">students or youth that they work with</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.349" end="01:23:49.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s also been because a couple of charities Big Brothers Big Sisters and</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.749" end="01:23:56.579" style="s2">The pinball Clemons Foundation both of whom work with young men across Canada and also in the United States and other countries</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.949" end="01:23:59.848" style="s2">They&#39;ve organized opportunities for me to come speak to</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.070" end="01:24:06.150" style="s2">Young men who they think would would benefit most from hearing from a young men who are struggling to find their way</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.309" end="01:24:10.498" style="s2">We&#39;re having a hard time in school who don&#39;t have primary support or Mentors</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.749" end="01:24:13.769" style="s2">So that&#39;s where a lot of the opportunity comes from is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.929" end="01:24:16.049" style="s2">you know people who I guess</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.420" end="01:24:22.469" style="s2">Feel like my story does renders innate or would resonate I think a lot of it is people who also recognize the institutions</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.469" end="01:24:27.178" style="s2">They&#39;re part of might not always understand young men or know how to respond to their needs</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.610" end="01:24:31.589" style="s2">Because and this is a problem that you&#39;ve tackled head-on in many cases</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.590" end="01:24:35.369" style="s2">I think they recognize a need to encourage young men to do well</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.369" end="01:24:41.518" style="s2">But don&#39;t know how to do it because the conversation around encouragement of men has in</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.010" end="01:24:48.659" style="s2">My view been been undermined and poisoned in many ways. I mean, even we have a prime minister here in Canada Justin Trudeau</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.659" end="01:24:51.779" style="s2">who you know goes to international summits and</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.300" end="01:24:54.300" style="s2">recklessly speaks about men using</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.939" end="01:24:58.349" style="s2">You know the buzzwords that he thinks are going to get him an applause</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.349" end="01:25:01.859" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s what he was talking about the dangerousness of working men</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.739" end="01:25:05.578" style="s2">Exactly. I know and it&#39;s absolutely appalling</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.219" end="01:25:12.448" style="s2">Yeah, well when you in and when you live in a country where that passes as leadership of your nation, no kidding</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.969" end="01:25:18.958" style="s2">You know people I think don&#39;t know what to do about the struggling young men. They see who who actually aren&#39;t you know?</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.900" end="01:25:25.229" style="s2">They don&#39;t symbolize male privilege in the ways that our prime minister might might think they do right? And so</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.329" end="01:25:29.788" style="s2">People are looking for other ways to engage and speak about young men and I yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.789" end="01:25:32.669" style="s2">Well at trying some words isn&#39;t her would go a long ways</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.670" end="01:25:37.319" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve been stunned but over the last year at you know discovering how</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.499" end="01:25:45.989" style="s2">rarely, so many people are encouraged and how starving they are for a few genuine words of encouragement and</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.209" end="01:25:51.149" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s like you said, even when you met that Professor who told you that you could maybe apply to Yale</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.150" end="01:25:53.549" style="s2">It&#39;s just that chance encounter a few words</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.550" end="01:25:54.570" style="s2">And you said you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.570" end="01:25:58.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve also realized how important the things that you say might be to people and</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.989" end="01:26:04.169" style="s2">That that&#39;s led you some strength to go on even, you know, during your current times of travail</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.170" end="01:26:10.109" style="s2">Let&#39;s say it is so important to put forward a message of encouragement to young men and say look</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.110" end="01:26:15.209" style="s2">you know get your act together for Christ&#39;s sake there&#39;s a lot more to you than you think and the world is crying out for</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.209" end="01:26:17.309" style="s2">you it needs you and</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.159" end="01:26:21.149" style="s2">That that irresponsibility. There&#39;s nothing about that</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.150" end="01:26:27.569" style="s2">That&#39;s nobler or justifiable. Even though you have your reasons to feel embittered and victimized. It&#39;s not the point of</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.150" end="01:26:34.019" style="s2">Course the world&#39;s harsh and brutal, but you you&#39;re someone who might be able to prevail nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.599" end="01:26:36.599" style="s2">And that&#39;s really something</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.969" end="01:26:43.118" style="s2">Yeah, I would say it&#39;s not just something but in some cases everything yeah, that&#39;s right assembly for instance</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.119" end="01:26:48.429" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly yeah a difference between giving the world the best you have to offer and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.339" end="01:26:53.829" style="s2">Giving it the world nothing. Yeah. Well, then you might be old but at least you have a clean conscience</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.279" end="01:26:57.279" style="s2">So it&#39;s not some head man</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.529" end="01:27:04.239" style="s2">Yeah, then that that&#39;s maybe the most valuable thing about yeah. Yeah, that&#39;s for sure. Look Jimmy. Oh, it was a pleasure talking to you</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.999" end="01:27:11.318" style="s2">Same to you. Dr. Peters. Yeah. Thank you for your time look and I&#39;m best luck, and I&#39;m hoping things go well for you</p>
