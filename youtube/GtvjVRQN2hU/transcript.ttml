<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:53.850" style="s2">what was your initial reaction I think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:56.010" style="s2">first became aware when people started</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:57.989" style="s2">telling me you know here&#39;s this guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.010" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">who&#39;s suddenly burst onto the public</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.989" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">scene and check out some of his youtubes</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">I looked at some of them and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:07.970" style="s2">actually very surprised hear somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:10.890" style="s2">talking in a very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.970" end="00:01:15.020" style="s2">intelligent way who seems to be prayer</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">an intellectual and clearly able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">stand up for himself in conversation</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">who&#39;s really raising the level of public</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">debate he seems to be arguing for very</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">similar things to the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably been having for a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:44.270" style="s2">few decades now particularly the reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">of religious experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.270" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">irreducibility of it to a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">materialist paradigm would you say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">was why you connected with him well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">think I connected with him to start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">because he was first of all taking the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">Christian story seriously normally</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">people who are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">spirituality it&#39;s sort of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">lights or shamanism or something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">that I mean it usually follows the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">principle ABC anything but Christian and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:16.510" style="s2">he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:18.850" style="s2">rather unfashionably talking about bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.510" end="00:02:21.490" style="s2">stories and in a very interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.850" end="00:02:24.190" style="s2">and taking seriously spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.490" end="00:02:27.370" style="s2">experience I mean it wouldn&#39;t be true to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.190" end="00:02:29.050" style="s2">say that materialists don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.370" end="00:02:31.420" style="s2">take it seriously I mean Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.050" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">after all as a meditator and so as Susan</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.420" end="00:02:37.390" style="s2">Blackmore and they&#39;re both committed</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:40.210" style="s2">atheists so there are quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.390" end="00:02:42.220" style="s2">people who now practice spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.210" end="00:02:46.570" style="s2">practices as the theme of my most recent</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.220" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">book science and spiritual practices who</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.570" end="00:02:51.520" style="s2">would argue that what&#39;s going on is all</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">inside the brain and I don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.520" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">that but the nevertheless there are some</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:03:00.910" style="s2">materialists and atheists who do agree</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.540" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">that spiritual practices work and confer</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.910" end="00:03:06.330" style="s2">important experiences but without</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">connecting it to any religious tradition</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.330" end="00:03:12.040" style="s2">how do we have these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:13.870" style="s2">because it just seemed like I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.040" end="00:03:15.220" style="s2">was the Matt Dillahunty and Petersen bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.870" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">Petersen was also going to be talking to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">Sam Harris later in the year and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.500" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">imagine they&#39;ll have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">conversation about the origins of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">right Sam Harris will say something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:27.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t need God to give you these</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:31.330" style="s2">rights they&#39;re just rationally obvious</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.400" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">is there any way of having that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.330" end="00:03:33.880" style="s2">conversation or are we just doomed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:36.760" style="s2">talk past each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.880" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">insofar as atheists have a polemical</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.760" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">agenda to attack all religion and is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:45.370" style="s2">dismiss it as being inferior product of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:47.230" style="s2">feeble-mindedness delusory and so on I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.370" end="00:03:51.490" style="s2">mean all the usual attitudes that one</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.230" end="00:03:52.810" style="s2">encounters among atheists then and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.490" end="00:03:54.190" style="s2">they think they&#39;re right and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.810" end="00:03:56.920" style="s2">seen the truth and anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.190" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">religious is being deluded and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.920" end="00:04:00.940" style="s2">probably continue their evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:03.100" style="s2">mission to liberate the world from</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.940" end="00:04:06.280" style="s2">religion I mean it is it has this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.100" end="00:04:08.980" style="s2">of evangelical zeal to it very often it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.280" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">certainly does in Sam Harris&#39;s case not</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.980" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">all atheists are evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:17.320" style="s2">proselytizing atheists John Gray for</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:20.049" style="s2">example whose recent book seven types of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.320" end="00:04:22.330" style="s2">atheism is enormously enlightening a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.049" end="00:04:24.970" style="s2">he&#39;s an atheist but he&#39;s certainly not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.330" end="00:04:26.200" style="s2">new atheist or a secular humanist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.970" end="00:04:31.020" style="s2">much more passive</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.200" end="00:04:34.510" style="s2">mystic and realistic atheist in my view</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.020" end="00:04:37.180" style="s2">and he also traces the history of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.510" end="00:04:39.670" style="s2">types of atheism were embodied say by</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.180" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">the Marquis de Sade the Marquis de Sade</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.670" end="00:04:45.430" style="s2">invented sadism or at least after whom</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">sadism is named was an atheist and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.430" end="00:04:51.460" style="s2">thought if the snake God anything can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:54.700" style="s2">permitted and the rule of nature is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.460" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">strong dominate the weak so why not if</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.700" end="00:04:59.350" style="s2">there&#39;s near God and why not have</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">sadistic practices where if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.350" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">beat someone and kill them your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:06.490" style="s2">pleasure why not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.620" style="s2">it&#39;s that kind of atheism you see is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.490" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">very different from secular humanism so</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.620" end="00:05:14.950" style="s2">there are different kinds of atheism</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:21.750" style="s2">that the modern kind is usually secular</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.950" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">humanists and so I suppose that the key</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.750" end="00:05:26.410" style="s2">questions really and not so much the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">origins of morality am you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.410" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">it&#39;s morality has origins in human</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">social nature and all social</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:39.310" style="s2">organization as I said before is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">involves cooperation between members of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.310" end="00:05:43.810" style="s2">the group they have to be sanctions on</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:46.420" style="s2">people&#39;s or animals behavior if they</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.810" end="00:05:48.130" style="s2">want to remain part of the group so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.420" end="00:05:50.620" style="s2">don&#39;t think it necessarily depends on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.130" end="00:05:52.660" style="s2">divine sanction and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.620" end="00:05:56.290" style="s2">perfectly natural and normal for human</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.660" end="00:05:58.090" style="s2">beings to look after their young and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.290" end="00:06:01.090" style="s2">fight to defend them I mean after all</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.090" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">mother bears defend their cubs and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.090" end="00:06:05.710" style="s2">know all sorts of animals defend and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:09.190" style="s2">protect their young and members of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.710" end="00:06:12.730" style="s2">group I think we&#39;re the particular form</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:14.650" style="s2">of morality that is the object this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.730" end="00:06:16.540" style="s2">discussion comes in is where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.650" end="00:06:19.240" style="s2">beyond the social group is natural and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.540" end="00:06:22.360" style="s2">normal for animals and humans to protect</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.240" end="00:06:24.760" style="s2">their young to be prepared to work hard</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.360" end="00:06:27.790" style="s2">to bring out their young is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:30.850" style="s2">instinctive to fight to protect them or</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.530" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">interesting and where the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.360" end="00:06:39.510" style="s2">message becomes more radical is where it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:41.340" style="s2">goes beyond your own group</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.510" end="00:06:43.920" style="s2">helping other groups that&#39;s not natural</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.010" end="00:13:54.450" style="s2">simplest forms of matter like electrons</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.140" end="00:13:57.030" style="s2">or atoms so it&#39;s not just in human</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.030" end="00:14:01.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a conscious side to nature well</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.700" end="00:14:04.890" style="s2">then that&#39;s no longer materialism in its</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.770" end="00:14:07.140" style="s2">old form it&#39;s something new so what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.890" end="00:14:09.090" style="s2">well I think the question I&#39;d ask Sam</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.140" end="00:14:12.840" style="s2">Harris if I were discussing with himself</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.090" end="00:14:15.660" style="s2">is just how does he see and understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.840" end="00:14:18.960" style="s2">consciousness and according to his book</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.660" end="00:14:21.060" style="s2">waking up he actually admits he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.960" end="00:14:23.700" style="s2">know he doesn&#39;t commit himself to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.060" end="00:14:25.650" style="s2">straightforward materialist position he</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.700" end="00:14:28.230" style="s2">says that&#39;s his default position but</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.650" end="00:14:31.590" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s more to it than that but</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.230" end="00:14:32.820" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t say what and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.590" end="00:14:35.010" style="s2">crucial thing in the whole debate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.820" end="00:14:36.810" style="s2">because what makes materials and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.010" end="00:14:39.210" style="s2">atheists different from everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.810" end="00:14:41.940" style="s2">their belief that the whole universe is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.210" end="00:14:44.190" style="s2">totally unconscious all legends are</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.940" end="00:14:45.990" style="s2">based on the idea that there are forms</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.190" end="00:14:48.660" style="s2">of consciousness beyond the human level</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.990" end="00:14:51.240" style="s2">that the universe comes forth from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.660" end="00:14:54.150" style="s2">conscious ground of being that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.240" end="00:14:55.710" style="s2">sort of underlying consciousness of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.150" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">whole of nature and of the whole of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.710" end="00:15:00.930" style="s2">universe that our consciousness is part</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:04.020" style="s2">of a much larger system of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.930" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">all religions take that for granted even</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.020" end="00:15:10.170" style="s2">Buddhism which defines the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:13.110" style="s2">state of being Nirvana as extinction or</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.170" end="00:15:15.270" style="s2">the void it&#39;s not the same as just</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.110" end="00:15:18.060" style="s2">material activities in the brain is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.270" end="00:15:20.360" style="s2">conscious state which is blissful but</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.060" end="00:15:24.920" style="s2">beyond normal definitions</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.360" end="00:15:27.950" style="s2">imitations and qualifications so I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.920" end="00:15:30.050" style="s2">that if one has a debate with an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.950" end="00:15:33.380" style="s2">where one takes for granted that their</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.050" end="00:15:36.589" style="s2">assumptions are correct that mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.380" end="00:15:39.589" style="s2">materialism is a true view of reality as</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.589" end="00:15:41.149" style="s2">both as bound up with science then</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.589" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">atheists will definitely win any</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.149" end="00:15:44.750" style="s2">argument based on that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:47.390" style="s2">taking the ultimate view of reality to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.750" end="00:15:50.269" style="s2">be this materialist philosophy which</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.390" end="00:15:53.450" style="s2">excludes God and angels and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.269" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">have to add them on as kind of quirks of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.450" end="00:15:59.750" style="s2">the human imagination or as phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:01.550" style="s2">inside human brains or if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.750" end="00:16:04.370" style="s2">idea of miracles and God working in</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.550" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">nature you have to say well gods then it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.370" end="00:16:08.570" style="s2">has to suspend the laws of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:10.040" style="s2">occasionally intervene these are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.570" end="00:16:13.790" style="s2">preposterous views that are very</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.040" end="00:16:15.649" style="s2">unconvincing and if a theist can force</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.790" end="00:16:17.750" style="s2">religious people into those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.649" end="00:16:20.120" style="s2">views then clearly there&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.750" end="00:16:22.430" style="s2">rational position so you have to reframe</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.120" end="00:16:25.250" style="s2">the debate yes I think you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.430" end="00:16:27.079" style="s2">reframe the debate because it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.250" end="00:16:28.940" style="s2">taken for granted that mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.079" end="00:16:31.220" style="s2">materialism is a true philosophy of</p>

<p begin="00:16:34.339" end="00:16:39.740" style="s2">atheists have a worldview not instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.370" end="00:16:41.990" style="s2">not having a worldview and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.740" end="00:16:44.329" style="s2">real discussion would involve discussing</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.990" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">their worldview as well as the religious</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.329" end="00:16:49.190" style="s2">worldview on a level playing field</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">instead of putting in the atheist in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.190" end="00:16:55.730" style="s2">I mean Dillahunty has the typical sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:16:58.430" style="s2">of rather he&#39;s not a bad a son there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.290" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">to this and you know you could benefit</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.660" end="00:17:07.220" style="s2">for a bit of skeptical thought I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:10.579" style="s2">totally in favor of skeptical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.220" end="00:17:12.290" style="s2">in my own case I apply the skepticism to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.579" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">the assumptions of science itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.290" end="00:17:17.000" style="s2">I think radical skepticism is a very</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.530" end="00:17:23.689" style="s2">your own beliefs and use this laser beam</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.500" end="00:17:26.329" style="s2">of skeptical thinking against everyone</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.329" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">invulnerable I think it should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:34.350" style="s2">applied to all belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:36.690" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating if you if you think</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.350" end="00:17:38.190" style="s2">about it as okay the materialist</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.690" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">worldview can explain absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.690" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">huge hole if you reframe it like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.730" end="00:17:48.780" style="s2">then it just seems to the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:51.750" style="s2">seems to collapse well of course it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.780" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">and and and materialist world view as an</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.750" end="00:17:57.210" style="s2">idea it&#39;s in mines it&#39;s nothing it</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.910" end="00:18:21.290" style="s2">minds in fact only inside some modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.890" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">human minds and it presupposes</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.290" end="00:18:27.630" style="s2">consciousness and for most materialists</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:30.110" style="s2">who think that physical realities the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.630" end="00:18:32.970" style="s2">only reality they have to believe</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.470" end="00:18:42.330" style="s2">their brains so how come they believe in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.610" style="s2">materialism well it must be their brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.330" end="00:18:46.679" style="s2">that makes them do it so why should you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:48.809" style="s2">or I believe in materialism just because</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.679" end="00:18:52.920" style="s2">their brains made them believe in it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.809" end="00:18:54.570" style="s2">there you can&#39;t prove it&#39;s true if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.920" end="00:18:57.059" style="s2">just something that your brains made you</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.059" end="00:19:01.590" style="s2">of Peterson&#39;s views very persuasive on</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.590" end="00:19:05.850" style="s2">game if you play that game in the world</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:13.710" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a playable game no and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.910" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s self contradictory because</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.010" end="00:20:50.440" style="s2">why should you listen to me rather than</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.930" end="00:20:52.300" style="s2">anyone else it&#39;s self contradictory and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.440" end="00:20:53.290" style="s2">also don&#39;t know if you agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.300" end="00:20:55.930" style="s2">but I also think that it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.290" end="00:20:58.210" style="s2">dangerous you have on one side the sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.930" end="00:20:59.830" style="s2">of dawkins types that are sort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.210" end="00:21:02.410" style="s2">we&#39;re the brights we&#39;re the intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.830" end="00:21:05.710" style="s2">ones or the all the religious people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.410" end="00:21:08.710" style="s2">not only wrong but dangerous in their</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.710" end="00:21:10.900" style="s2">beliefs and we hold up this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.710" end="00:21:13.390" style="s2">secular humanism and whereas I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.900" end="00:21:15.490" style="s2">most people listening to a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.390" end="00:21:17.020" style="s2">materialist worldview will put two and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.490" end="00:21:19.380" style="s2">two together and say well as might as</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.020" end="00:21:21.610" style="s2">well just take what I can for myself I</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.380" end="00:21:24.190" style="s2">don&#39;t see a way out of like complete</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.610" end="00:21:25.870" style="s2">selfishness and I wonder what impact</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.190" end="00:21:27.370" style="s2">that has on the world those are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.870" end="00:21:29.620" style="s2">rampant materialism that we see in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.370" end="00:21:31.990" style="s2">culture and how much of it is being fed</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.620" end="00:21:35.470" style="s2">by these kind of anti spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.990" end="00:21:37.780" style="s2">worldviews well I think quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.470" end="00:21:40.390" style="s2">its fed by anti spiritual world views I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.780" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">mean after all in ordinary parlance</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.390" end="00:21:44.950" style="s2">people use the word materialistic to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.450" style="s2">refer to people who like going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.950" end="00:21:49.270" style="s2">shopping mouths and buying lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.450" end="00:21:52.540" style="s2">things who are obsessed with money</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.270" end="00:21:54.490" style="s2">I mean philosophically speaking is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.540" end="00:21:57.080" style="s2">doctrine that matters the only reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.490" end="00:21:59.870" style="s2">but the two are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.080" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">and one can&#39;t pretend that in the past</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.870" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">there were you know humans weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:05.720" style="s2">greedy there were plenty of greedy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:08.090" style="s2">people at all times but in past</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.720" end="00:22:10.190" style="s2">civilizations greed and avarice was seen</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.090" end="00:22:14.860" style="s2">as deadly sins not as admirable</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.860" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">say there were countervailing forces in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.720" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">traditional societies so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:27.020" style="s2">the main danger of materialism mr. tic</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:29.450" style="s2">gives people a false view of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.020" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">and and the reality in which they live</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.450" end="00:22:35.720" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely isolating it trade treats</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.580" end="00:23:51.680" style="s2">their series that in secular societies</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.740" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">the endemic mental condition or mental</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.680" end="00:23:57.020" style="s2">problem is depression on a massive scale</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.430" end="00:24:05.749" style="s2">lots of suicide even among children it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:07.809" style="s2">a depressing worldview and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.749" end="00:24:10.129" style="s2">and it can lead to this rampant</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.809" end="00:24:12.970" style="s2">destruction of the environment and now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.129" end="00:24:15.470" style="s2">think that is a kind of spin off from it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.970" end="00:24:16.879" style="s2">but I wouldn&#39;t like it he doesn&#39;t chart</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.470" end="00:24:19.700" style="s2">the natural world and then why bother</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.879" end="00:24:23.479" style="s2">protecting it yes I mean I wouldn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.700" end="00:24:26.509" style="s2">to say though that it&#39;s only atheists</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.479" end="00:24:28.099" style="s2">and materialists who do that I mean look</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.509" end="00:24:31.820" style="s2">at the United States it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.099" end="00:24:34.700" style="s2">religious than Europe and yet America</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.820" end="00:24:37.220" style="s2">leads the world in wasteful consumerism</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.700" end="00:24:39.049" style="s2">in fact it sets the kind of gold</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.220" end="00:24:41.330" style="s2">standard for the world in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.049" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">wasteful consumerism and a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.330" end="00:24:49.419" style="s2">people are actually religious believers</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:51.859" style="s2">so I wouldn&#39;t want to overstate the case</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.419" end="00:24:54.489" style="s2">but I think this there is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.859" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">about the process and Reformation that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.489" end="00:24:59.779" style="s2">disenchanted the world even before the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:02.599" style="s2">scientific mechanistic revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.779" end="00:25:05.019" style="s2">17th century disenchanted further but</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.599" end="00:25:08.299" style="s2">the ground was already prepared by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.019" end="00:25:10.419" style="s2">Reformation which was on the whole my</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.299" end="00:25:13.700" style="s2">process of disenchantment of nature</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.419" end="00:25:16.849" style="s2">withdrawal of God from nature and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.700" end="00:25:18.529" style="s2">focus of religion into the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.849" end="00:25:21.289" style="s2">between humans and God</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.529" end="00:25:24.289" style="s2">leaving nature out of it whereas most</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.289" end="00:25:26.570" style="s2">traditional religions including Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.289" end="00:25:29.419" style="s2">and Catholic Catholic forms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.570" end="00:25:32.679" style="s2">Christianity have included in a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.419" end="00:25:37.159" style="s2">place is sacred times you know festivals</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.679" end="00:25:38.659" style="s2">pilgrimages the sense that the natural</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.159" end="00:25:41.509" style="s2">world is a reflection of the Divine</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.659" end="00:25:43.789" style="s2">Being and and in Hinduism you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.509" end="00:25:47.119" style="s2">sacred animals and holy trees and all</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.789" end="00:25:49.489" style="s2">that kind of thing the Protestants who</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.119" end="00:25:51.649" style="s2">didn&#39;t want any of that they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.489" end="00:25:53.359" style="s2">focus religion on humans and human</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.649" end="00:25:55.190" style="s2">relationship to God and that sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.359" end="00:26:02.440" style="s2">prepared the grounds for humanism</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.190" end="00:26:05.779" style="s2">there&#39;s excessive emphasis on humans so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.440" end="00:26:07.669" style="s2">again I wouldn&#39;t like to say as all due</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.779" end="00:26:10.309" style="s2">to mechanistic science or materialism</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.669" end="00:26:12.499" style="s2">there are long historical currents that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.309" end="00:26:15.139" style="s2">have been at work I listen to your talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.499" end="00:26:17.839" style="s2">with Mark Vernon about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.139" end="00:26:18.650" style="s2">and you described him as obscure and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.839" end="00:26:20.150" style="s2">wondered what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.650" end="00:26:22.850" style="s2">what you meant by that and whether I</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.150" end="00:26:25.070" style="s2">agree or not I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s evasive</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.850" end="00:26:26.600" style="s2">on the question is he a Christian isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.070" end="00:26:30.890" style="s2">he a Christian I mean one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.600" end="00:26:32.750" style="s2">I liked about Delahunt is he did put out</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.890" end="00:26:36.410" style="s2">at YouTube about his discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.750" end="00:26:38.150" style="s2">Jordan Peters and afterwards you know if</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.410" end="00:26:40.610" style="s2">if he said Jordan Pearson are your</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.150" end="00:26:41.870" style="s2">question and do you believe in God he</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.610" end="00:26:44.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just say yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.870" end="00:26:46.340" style="s2">he&#39;s as well as the story and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.600" end="00:26:48.950" style="s2">to I mean it becomes a much more</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.340" end="00:26:52.910" style="s2">complicated thing which what does he</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.950" end="00:26:55.130" style="s2">believe is he a Christian isn&#39;t he and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.910" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">if he is a Christian does he actually go</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.130" end="00:26:59.420" style="s2">to church services or take the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:27:01.550" style="s2">sacraments I mean all that is obscure</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.420" end="00:27:04.730" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about these religious</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.550" end="00:27:06.830" style="s2">issues but it&#39;s unclear as to his own</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.730" end="00:27:08.150" style="s2">position and practice I mean I can see</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.830" end="00:27:10.310" style="s2">why he doesn&#39;t won&#39;t say I believe in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.150" end="00:27:11.960" style="s2">God cause for an atheist that presses a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.310" end="00:27:13.670" style="s2">button they think they immediately know</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.960" end="00:27:16.340" style="s2">think they know what you think I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.670" end="00:27:18.770" style="s2">see that yeah and usually the God they</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.340" end="00:27:20.420" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in in my discussions a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.770" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">theist turns out to be a God I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.420" end="00:27:24.890" style="s2">believe in either yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">it&#39;s more of he would describe himself</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:31.850" style="s2">to say by act as if God exists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.020" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">probably as close as he come to saying I</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.850" end="00:27:35.180" style="s2">believe that God exists because he</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:36.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really I&#39;ve seen him in other</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.680" end="00:27:40.730" style="s2">belief belief is something you act out</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.020" end="00:27:42.680" style="s2">in the world belief belief is something</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.730" end="00:27:44.690" style="s2">that influences your actions and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.680" end="00:27:47.960" style="s2">not it&#39;s merely an intellectual conceit</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.690" end="00:27:51.050" style="s2">that is not that is ungrounded and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.960" end="00:27:53.330" style="s2">he&#39;s also got that which he also links</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.050" end="00:27:55.430" style="s2">to the Catholic Church about this terror</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.330" end="00:27:57.350" style="s2">of intellectualism for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.430" end="00:27:59.180" style="s2">because the intellect can go and create</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.350" end="00:28:00.860" style="s2">worlds that we then inhabit and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.180" end="00:28:03.530" style="s2">turn out to be missing something crucial</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.860" end="00:28:06.350" style="s2">all of these intellectual utopias seem</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.530" end="00:28:08.390" style="s2">to degenerate into into disco pious</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.350" end="00:28:11.090" style="s2">because they&#39;re missing something yes oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.390" end="00:28:13.400" style="s2">I agree with all that no problem with</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.090" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">that and I think that believed just as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.400" end="00:28:18.350" style="s2">sort of system of I mean against the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:21.590" style="s2">idea of religion as a system primarily</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.350" end="00:28:24.050" style="s2">of belief I don&#39;t think it is I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.590" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of practice just as he</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.050" end="00:28:28.970" style="s2">says and and ultimately the way you</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:30.980" style="s2">behave in the world and that&#39;s why my</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.970" end="00:28:31.730" style="s2">books called science and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.980" end="00:28:33.830" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.730" end="00:28:36.110" style="s2">because I think that we have to start</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.830" end="00:28:38.180" style="s2">from practices which lead to experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.110" end="00:28:41.030" style="s2">and that is primarily about experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.180" end="00:28:43.310" style="s2">even for Christians who have a Creed</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.030" end="00:28:45.470" style="s2">which is about a belief system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.310" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">not what most practicing Christians are</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.470" end="00:28:50.390" style="s2">primarily about they don&#39;t work out</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:52.400" style="s2">their position in relation to the Creed</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.390" end="00:28:54.590" style="s2">and then start going to church they go</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.400" end="00:28:56.210" style="s2">to church because they take part in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.590" end="00:28:58.220" style="s2">sacraments the communion they like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.210" end="00:29:00.560" style="s2">singing with other people as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.220" end="00:29:02.870" style="s2">community they&#39;re in a sacred place they</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.560" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">observe the festivals it provides rites</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.870" end="00:29:10.220" style="s2">of passage and so on I mean it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:13.280" style="s2">kind of mythic structure and pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.220" end="00:29:16.430" style="s2">meaning and so forth as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.280" end="00:29:18.770" style="s2">morality but it&#39;s not primarily about</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.430" end="00:29:21.500" style="s2">abstract intellectual beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.770" end="00:29:23.810" style="s2">certainly agree with that but I think is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.500" end="00:29:25.880" style="s2">the reason I find him obscure is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.810" end="00:29:27.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not I mean when you explain it it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.880" end="00:29:29.930" style="s2">makes sense to me but you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.860" end="00:29:32.050" style="s2">listen to hours of his video text work</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.930" end="00:29:37.160" style="s2">that out and I just haven&#39;t had the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.050" end="00:29:39.410" style="s2">to go into sort of Peterson Studies in</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.160" end="00:29:41.810" style="s2">the depth that some people have I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.410" end="00:29:43.790" style="s2">suspect that you you too would find an</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.810" end="00:29:45.800" style="s2">awful lot to agree on from what I&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.790" end="00:29:47.630" style="s2">think so I mean I&#39;d be very happy to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.800" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">meet you my admire him and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.630" end="00:29:52.580" style="s2">she&#39;s doing is great I hope that comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">about Peterson is has got a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.580" end="00:29:56.900" style="s2">very high profile interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:30:00.890" style="s2">discussions with sam harris coming up</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.900" end="00:30:03.020" style="s2">and it seems that there is this huge</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.890" end="00:30:07.040" style="s2">interest at the moment in discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.020" end="00:30:12.110" style="s2">these deeper ideas and do you have some</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.040" end="00:30:14.330" style="s2">some hope or expectation that what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.110" end="00:30:17.150" style="s2">are seeing is some kind of revival of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.330" end="00:30:18.650" style="s2">maybe a 21st century spirituality or at</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.150" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">least consideration of these deeper</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.650" end="00:30:24.140" style="s2">questions on a much more widespread</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:26.450" style="s2">level I think there&#39;s already a great</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.140" end="00:30:29.090" style="s2">revival of spirituality going on I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.450" end="00:30:32.840" style="s2">the enormous popular interest in</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.090" end="00:30:35.660" style="s2">meditation for example and yoga these</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.840" end="00:30:37.610" style="s2">are spiritual practices there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.660" end="00:30:41.000" style="s2">enormous revival of pilgrimage going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.610" end="00:30:42.890" style="s2">in Europe and something like 300,000</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.000" end="00:30:45.580" style="s2">people a year walked Santiago de</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.890" end="00:30:50.740" style="s2">Compostela in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.580" end="00:30:53.230" style="s2">less than a thousand so we&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.740" end="00:30:56.020" style="s2">great growth in interest to world</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.230" end="00:30:58.780" style="s2">psychedelics I mean the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.020" end="00:31:00.520" style="s2">revolution of the 1960s makes it sons if</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.780" end="00:31:02.530" style="s2">it was something that happened then but</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.520" end="00:31:04.600" style="s2">there&#39;s more people taking psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.530" end="00:31:06.580" style="s2">now than the well then and I think there</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.600" end="00:31:08.800" style="s2">but the pervasive influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.580" end="00:31:11.010" style="s2">culture is very great and for many</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.800" end="00:31:13.630" style="s2">people that opens up a great interest in</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.010" end="00:31:17.110" style="s2">spiritual realms and most people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.630" end="00:31:19.720" style="s2">taken psychedelics usually think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.110" end="00:31:21.520" style="s2">more going on than just chemical changes</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.720" end="00:31:23.380" style="s2">inside the brain and obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.520" end="00:31:26.290" style="s2">part of it that&#39;s why these drugs work</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.380" end="00:31:29.710" style="s2">but they&#39;re pointing to something much</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.290" end="00:31:33.550" style="s2">more than just changes in the brain on</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.710" end="00:31:36.430" style="s2">the temporal lobes or something so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.550" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">think there&#39;s already this big spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.430" end="00:31:43.630" style="s2">revival going on but I think it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:45.430" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t done is is made contact with</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.630" end="00:31:48.310" style="s2">the Christian tradition with our</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.430" end="00:31:50.830" style="s2">indigenous religious traditions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.310" end="00:31:53.830" style="s2">outside the Christian churches for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.830" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">most part and involves the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.830" end="00:31:59.740" style="s2">diluted forms of Buddhism like secular</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:02.560" style="s2">Buddhism or sort of neo shamanism you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.740" end="00:32:05.770" style="s2">know people who take ayahuasca in Peru</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.560" end="00:32:08.460" style="s2">and I&#39;m you can now do a weekend course</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.770" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">and become a certified Shaymin I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.460" end="00:32:16.590" style="s2">so these have all got rather diluted and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:19.570" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got a mishmash of different</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.590" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">traditions but all of them I think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.570" end="00:32:24.730" style="s2">can learn from but I think the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:27.040" style="s2">what makes Peterson so interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.730" end="00:32:30.100" style="s2">the way it contacts the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.040" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">tradition and what makes atheists</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.100" end="00:32:35.110" style="s2">interesting in this debate is that their</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:37.330" style="s2">stance is almost entirely to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.110" end="00:32:40.390" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.330" end="00:32:41.950" style="s2">in what John Gray says is basically a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.390" end="00:32:44.980" style="s2">Christian heresy</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.950" end="00:32:47.890" style="s2">it&#39;s basically rooted in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.980" end="00:32:51.940" style="s2">shares many of the same assumptions and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.890" end="00:32:53.020" style="s2">is part of a wider Christian debate they</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.940" end="00:32:55.990" style="s2">don&#39;t like it when you point that out</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.020" end="00:32:58.690" style="s2">though well historically speaking they</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.990" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">can&#39;t really deny it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.690" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">so I do think it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:08.030" style="s2">period that we&#39;re in and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:10.430" style="s2">that some atheists like Susan Blackmore</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.030" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">and Sam Harris who have taken up</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.430" end="00:33:16.220" style="s2">spiritual practices really where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:16.760" style="s2">cutting edge of this debate is at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.220" end="00:33:19.010" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.760" end="00:33:21.350" style="s2">old-school atheists like Daniel Dennett</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.010" end="00:33:23.930" style="s2">and Richard Dawkins who just dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.350" end="00:33:26.930" style="s2">the whole lot are not really part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.930" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">what&#39;s going on that&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.930" end="00:33:32.300" style="s2">intellectual polemic all stance is</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:33.980" style="s2">basically 19th century point of view</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.300" end="00:33:36.140" style="s2">that they&#39;re representing that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.980" end="00:33:38.780" style="s2">take into account the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:41.150" style="s2">revolution the growth of yoga and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.780" end="00:33:43.400" style="s2">meditation the opening to Eastern</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.820" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">sense that someone like sam harris is on</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.380" end="00:33:53.540" style="s2">more of a journey as more open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:55.430" style="s2">than Dawkins for example yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.540" end="00:33:58.460" style="s2">he&#39;s more open-minded than dawkins but</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.430" end="00:34:01.190" style="s2">he still got this extreme anger against</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.460" end="00:34:03.650" style="s2">anything to do religion and he treats</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.190" end="00:34:07.720" style="s2">religion with contempt and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.650" end="00:34:10.600" style="s2">just bad manners for example in his book</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.720" end="00:34:13.850" style="s2">waking up where he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.600" end="00:34:18.200" style="s2">meditation practices he said our job is</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:20.369" style="s2">interesting reading a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.259" end="00:35:29.730" style="s2">have an appreciation for the religion</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:32.009" style="s2">and it&#39;s very easy to get the impression</p>

<p begin="00:35:39.450" end="00:35:43.289" style="s2">interesting that for a long time at</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.759" end="00:35:45.509" style="s2">least as far as I can tell the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.289" end="00:35:48.059" style="s2">online world was a bastion of new that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.509" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">new atheism it was very cynical very</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.059" end="00:35:52.049" style="s2">skeptical and it&#39;s it seems that at</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:55.349" style="s2">least very interesting to me that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.049" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">seems to be at least some move towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.349" end="00:36:02.690" style="s2">an appreciation of religion now yes I</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:06.390" style="s2">think most people who&#39;ve been raised</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.690" end="00:36:08.849" style="s2">atheist I mean in Britain most people</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.390" end="00:36:12.839" style="s2">have been raised without any religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.849" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">over 50% of the population now identify</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.839" end="00:36:19.289" style="s2">themselves as having no religion and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:22.730" style="s2">many people have been raised by parents</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.730" end="00:36:26.999" style="s2">so there&#39;s a a great deal of ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:28.739" style="s2">about the Christian tradition most</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.999" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">people don&#39;t know much about it except</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.739" end="00:36:33.089" style="s2">what they&#39;ve read in a theist polemics</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:37.230" style="s2">and for them Christian who is all about</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.089" end="00:36:40.200" style="s2">an incredible belief in a God whose</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.230" end="00:36:42.059" style="s2">outside nature and who somehow engineers</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.200" end="00:36:44.849" style="s2">the universe in the first place and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.059" end="00:36:46.619" style="s2">suppresses a start button a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.849" end="00:36:49.289" style="s2">implausible view of God which I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.619" end="00:36:52.319" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t accept myself but they</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.289" end="00:36:54.660" style="s2">think that&#39;s what Christians believe and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.319" end="00:36:57.180" style="s2">then they see it as a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.660" end="00:37:02.390" style="s2">dogmas that people are terrified into</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.180" end="00:37:05.009" style="s2">believing by scheming priests and a</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.009" end="00:37:10.170" style="s2">and bloodshed I mean these are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.930" end="00:37:14.700" style="s2">standard kinds of views that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.170" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">people have and they often see a Theo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.700" end="00:37:19.519" style="s2">and more secular humanism as</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:21.769" style="s2">that goes beyond all this and leaves all</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.519" end="00:37:24.200" style="s2">that baggage behind as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.769" end="00:37:26.539" style="s2">liberation and I think for some people</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.200" end="00:37:28.279" style="s2">it is a liberation but for people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.539" end="00:37:32.329" style="s2">never known about the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.279" end="00:37:33.890" style="s2">tradition they don&#39;t know that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.329" end="00:37:36.410" style="s2">of God and the Christian tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.890" end="00:37:38.210" style="s2">not some being sitting on a cloud with</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.410" end="00:37:40.999" style="s2">the white beard no one&#39;s ever believed</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.210" end="00:37:44.599" style="s2">that it&#39;s the doctrine of the Holy</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.999" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">Trinity a much more sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.599" end="00:37:51.490" style="s2">interesting view of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:54.200" style="s2">ultimate consciousness so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.490" end="00:37:57.049" style="s2">talking about the Bible stories as</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.200" end="00:37:58.519" style="s2">petersen does is very illuminating for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.049" end="00:38:00.499" style="s2">lot of people because they they&#39;ve never</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.259" end="00:38:18.349" style="s2">lot of comments saying how naive a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.279" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">of the the sort of simple materialism of</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.749" end="00:38:28.789" style="s2">appreciation of religion yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.660" end="00:38:33.319" style="s2">no a lot of atheism is extremely naive</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.789" end="00:38:34.910" style="s2">and is is based on a few clichés and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.319" end="00:38:37.910" style="s2">kind of emotional rejection of</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.910" end="00:38:41.989" style="s2">is more sophisticated obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.859" end="00:38:43.670" style="s2">there are some people who have a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.989" end="00:38:45.890" style="s2">understanding and there are some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:48.200" style="s2">who become atheists having had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.890" end="00:38:51.950" style="s2">thorough grounding in Christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.200" end="00:38:53.930" style="s2">Judaism it&#39;s an interesting fact that of</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.930" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">that most easily leads to atheism most</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.530" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">actually very similar to Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.130" end="00:39:37.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of religion in itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:38.940" style="s2">it&#39;s mainly brought about by taking over</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.290" end="00:39:55.860" style="s2">so humanity becomes a substitute for God</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:39:57.930" style="s2">and many of the things that were</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.830" end="00:41:31.840" style="s2">because they were part from saying we</p>

<p begin="00:41:39.850" end="00:41:45.310" style="s2">and say well why should we treat</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.260" end="00:41:47.980" style="s2">everyone as equal and people never used</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.310" end="00:41:50.320" style="s2">to in India there was a whole religion</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.980" end="00:41:52.600" style="s2">based on a caste system which didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.320" end="00:41:54.760" style="s2">treat everyone as of equal value is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.600" end="00:41:57.490" style="s2">part of human nature to treat everyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.760" end="00:42:00.040" style="s2">as equal value this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.490" end="00:42:01.780" style="s2">because this is a point that Petersen</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.040" end="00:42:04.630" style="s2">recently got hung up with Matt</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.780" end="00:42:07.840" style="s2">Dillahunty on where he was trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.630" end="00:42:09.910" style="s2">the ethic you think is derived from</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.840" end="00:42:13.720" style="s2">rationality is actually coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.910" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">far deeper place yes Dillahunty I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.720" end="00:42:19.510" style="s2">studied the whole integer interchange in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:21.310" style="s2">detail but Dillahunty basically goes off</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.510" end="00:42:24.010" style="s2">on the standard humanist thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.310" end="00:42:25.990" style="s2">don&#39;t need God to have morality which I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.010" end="00:42:29.590" style="s2">agree with you don&#39;t need you can have</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.990" end="00:42:32.950" style="s2">moral systems without God and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.590" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">arguably animal societies which are all</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.950" end="00:42:37.270" style="s2">all social animals have societies based</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:39.390" style="s2">on mutual help and interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.270" end="00:42:42.180" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes them social animals</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.390" end="00:42:48.690" style="s2">and they don&#39;t believe in God in any</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.180" end="00:42:52.060" style="s2">recognizable form to us so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.690" end="00:42:53.770" style="s2">where Dillahunty is wrong and where I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.060" end="00:42:56.530" style="s2">think a lot of secular humanists are</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.770" end="00:42:57.880" style="s2">wrong is that they trace this value to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.530" end="00:43:00.490" style="s2">the Enlightenment they think the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.880" end="00:43:03.730" style="s2">Enlightenment is the source of the sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.490" end="00:43:06.520" style="s2">that all humans are of equal value well</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.730" end="00:43:08.950" style="s2">I think it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.520" end="00:43:10.750" style="s2">chief Enlightenment figures the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.950" end="00:43:13.300" style="s2">of them all in France was Voltaire</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.750" end="00:43:15.970" style="s2">Voltaire was a tremendous racist he</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.300" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">thought that you know that Africans were</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.970" end="00:43:22.270" style="s2">an inferior species he was extremely</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:24.220" style="s2">anti-semitic and the founders of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.270" end="00:43:26.110" style="s2">United States and the Declaration of</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.220" end="00:43:29.140" style="s2">Independence which if you like Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.110" end="00:43:31.720" style="s2">Jefferson were slave owners so they</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.140" end="00:43:33.400" style="s2">believed in equal rights but only for</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.720" end="00:43:36.850" style="s2">people like themselves sort of white</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.400" end="00:43:39.480" style="s2">English stock he didn&#39;t think it applied</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.850" end="00:43:42.810" style="s2">to black slaves from Africa</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.480" end="00:43:44.250" style="s2">so I think that if you go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.810" end="00:43:48.590" style="s2">Enlightenment it&#39;s not at all obvious</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.250" end="00:43:51.900" style="s2">that enlightenment values favored</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.590" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">equality of humans and they traced their</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.900" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">inspiration to ancient Greece and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:59.160" style="s2">ancient Greece was a slave owning</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">society so it&#39;s a much more complex</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.160" end="00:44:04.920" style="s2">picture as to how the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:06.780" style="s2">universal human rights arose and a great</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.920" end="00:44:09.900" style="s2">deal of it comes from not from secular</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.780" end="00:44:14.270" style="s2">humanism but from Christian humanism and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.900" end="00:44:16.830" style="s2">the sense that humans have divine nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.270" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">what part of the Christian tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.830" end="00:44:21.810" style="s2">is especially in the Eastern Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:25.470" style="s2">churches to do with the process of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.810" end="00:44:29.700" style="s2">deification Jesus was a human being who</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.470" end="00:44:32.310" style="s2">became filled with God became a divine</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:35.640" style="s2">and opened the way for all other humans</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.310" end="00:44:38.610" style="s2">to become divine and in a way the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.640" end="00:44:41.670" style="s2">religion of humanism secular humanism it</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.610" end="00:44:44.370" style="s2">takes this divinity of humanity as its</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.670" end="00:44:47.010" style="s2">starting point and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.370" end="00:44:51.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve are now Harare brings out so</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.010" end="00:44:53.160" style="s2">clearly he&#39;s an atheist so it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.030" end="00:44:56.580" style="s2">if he&#39;s arguing from this point of view</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.160" end="00:44:59.190" style="s2">as a polemical argument against secular</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.580" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">humanism he&#39;s not he is himself an</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.190" end="00:45:07.410" style="s2">atheist but the religion of humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:10.110" style="s2">makes very little sense without this</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.410" end="00:45:11.580" style="s2">kind of divinization background because</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.110" end="00:45:14.100" style="s2">why should human life be especially</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.580" end="00:45:16.710" style="s2">sacred why not all life I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.100" end="00:45:19.350" style="s2">Buddhists after all say all sentient</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.710" end="00:45:21.330" style="s2">beings the Tibetan Buddhist so why</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.350" end="00:45:24.750" style="s2">should it be such good thing for humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.330" end="00:45:27.150" style="s2">to be totally sacred and every human</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.750" end="00:45:28.950" style="s2">life to be cherished well we can have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.150" end="00:45:30.860" style="s2">battery chickens raised in their</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.950" end="00:45:33.870" style="s2">billions and in appalling conditions</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.860" end="00:45:36.900" style="s2">this is interesting as well because this</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.870" end="00:45:39.630" style="s2">is another point that we saw Dillahunty</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.900" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">and Peterson get caught up on Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.630" end="00:45:44.310" style="s2">was kind of scientist hunter you are a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:46.710" style="s2">Christian or you are you do accept the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.310" end="00:45:49.620" style="s2">judeo-christian worldview you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.710" end="00:45:51.120" style="s2">accept that you do and you could see the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.620" end="00:45:52.980" style="s2">argument degenerate because the last</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.120" end="00:45:54.329" style="s2">thing that he wants to accept is</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.980" end="00:45:55.950" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re actually a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.329" end="00:45:58.710" style="s2">pretending not to be it just feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.950" end="00:46:01.380" style="s2">a very difficult conversation to have if</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.710" end="00:46:04.440" style="s2">if what you&#39;re actually saying is you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.380" end="00:46:07.079" style="s2">you have an entire lived morality an</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.440" end="00:46:09.030" style="s2">inherited morality that you that means</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.079" end="00:46:11.550" style="s2">that you&#39;re actually living out these</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.030" end="00:46:13.980" style="s2">values that you don&#39;t you say you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.550" end="00:46:16.380" style="s2">believe it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.980" end="00:46:16.980" style="s2">triggering thing for for an atheist to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.380" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">be told</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.980" end="00:46:22.050" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t tell atheist that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:25.560" style="s2">basically Christians I doing they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.050" end="00:46:28.200" style="s2">but I think that as if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.560" end="00:46:30.359" style="s2">historical roots of human rights which</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.200" end="00:46:33.990" style="s2">after all any became a kind of standard</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.359" end="00:46:35.880" style="s2">liberal trope in the 20th century I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.990" end="00:46:37.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not as if people always had this</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.880" end="00:46:40.770" style="s2">fear as I say at the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.530" end="00:46:42.780" style="s2">itself the Enlightenment intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.770" end="00:46:46.410" style="s2">are racist and slave owners for the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.780" end="00:46:48.900" style="s2">part and it wasn&#39;t really until the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.410" end="00:46:51.810" style="s2">century of this idea of human rights</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.900" end="00:46:53.640" style="s2">began to take root but for much of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.810" end="00:46:56.310" style="s2">19th century under the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.640" end="00:46:58.290" style="s2">Darwinism in the later 19th century the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.310" end="00:47:00.540" style="s2">view was that there are superior races</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.290" end="00:47:02.819" style="s2">and inferior races and natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.540" end="00:47:05.220" style="s2">favors the white races that&#39;s why they</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.819" end="00:47:07.050" style="s2">dominate the world and that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.220" end="00:47:09.210" style="s2">should be because this is Darwinian and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.050" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s based on science that was the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.210" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">standard view and it was taken for</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:15.569" style="s2">granted by the imperial powers most</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.740" end="00:47:17.730" style="s2">people in them that the white man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.569" end="00:47:19.560" style="s2">burden was to civilize the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.730" end="00:47:24.599" style="s2">world through a superior civilization</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.560" end="00:47:27.750" style="s2">and so their slavery itself didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.599" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">after well it still exists but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.750" end="00:47:33.060" style="s2">the slave trade came to an end by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:34.619" style="s2">and then in the British Empire of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.060" end="00:47:38.069" style="s2">decades before it did in the United</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.530" end="00:47:50.579" style="s2">serve right up until the early 20th</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.170" end="00:47:52.530" style="s2">century the idea of really quality of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.579" end="00:47:55.530" style="s2">human nature wasn&#39;t a widespread belief</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.530" end="00:47:57.089" style="s2">in any culture I&#39;ve seen the comparison</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.530" end="00:47:58.970" style="s2">made quite a few times online between</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.089" end="00:48:01.800" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and Terence Mckenna</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.970" end="00:48:03.329" style="s2">quite a few people saying not since they</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.589" end="00:48:35.529" style="s2">Terence had a bardic poetic gift much</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.759" end="00:48:37.869" style="s2">more so than Jordan Peterson I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.529" end="00:48:40.119" style="s2">Jordan Peterson gives the impression of</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.459" end="00:48:49.509" style="s2">the struggle while it might be Leah sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.349" end="00:48:53.109" style="s2">of like that you see someone honest</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.109" end="00:48:58.169" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like that at all Terence had this</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.969" end="00:49:13.749" style="s2">know whereas whereas Jordan Peterson say</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.739" end="00:49:15.609" style="s2">well Young&#39;s got these archetypes and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.749" end="00:49:18.099" style="s2">got these things hearing he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.609" end="00:49:20.979" style="s2">the imagination Terence was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.099" end="00:49:23.619" style="s2">living in it and partly because he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.979" end="00:49:26.769" style="s2">spent so much time in psychedelic realms</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.619" end="00:49:32.109" style="s2">which in in exploring realms of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.769" end="00:49:34.119" style="s2">imagination and also chance wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.109" end="00:49:39.789" style="s2">really a polemicist he wasn&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.119" end="00:49:41.529" style="s2">make a point or score points I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.789" end="00:49:44.759" style="s2">was trying to give a new view of human</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.529" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">evolution that consciousness had evolved</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.759" end="00:49:49.959" style="s2">partly through psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:52.779" style="s2">that when people discovered psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.959" end="00:49:54.549" style="s2">in some cultures a long time ago it must</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.779" end="00:49:57.189" style="s2">have shaped the way they saw the world I</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.549" end="00:49:59.589" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very plausible point of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.189" end="00:50:01.439" style="s2">view I think he overstated it because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.589" end="00:50:05.919" style="s2">don&#39;t think all cultures were shaped by</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.439" end="00:50:08.439" style="s2">psychedelics some might have been where</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.919" end="00:50:09.909" style="s2">as jordan peterson is more polemical and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.439" end="00:50:14.430" style="s2">political I mean he rose to prominence</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.909" end="00:50:17.190" style="s2">through arguments about gender and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.430" end="00:50:20.430" style="s2">serve compulsory you know gender</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.190" end="00:50:21.480" style="s2">politics in university settings and he</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.430" end="00:50:24.119" style="s2">does talk an awful lot about</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.480" end="00:50:26.430" style="s2">psychedelics John Peterson but he</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.119" end="00:50:28.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lecture where he uses it</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.430" end="00:50:30.839" style="s2">to talk about the irreducibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.200" end="00:50:33.180" style="s2">religious experience I see well I</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.839" end="00:50:35.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard that talks I don&#39;t know he</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:38.549" style="s2">talks about psychedelics an awful lot as</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.279" end="00:50:40.829" style="s2">being one of the primary if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.549" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">accumulate all of the the reports of</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.829" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">mystical experience that they&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:45.390" style="s2">the most reliable ways of inducing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:47.700" style="s2">mystical experience and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:49.829" style="s2">understand them at all he says they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.700" end="00:50:52.170" style="s2">completely inexplicable within our</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.829" end="00:50:54.420" style="s2">current paradigm I see well then that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.170" end="00:50:58.049" style="s2">might bring him closer to Terence but as</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.420" end="00:51:00.210" style="s2">a style of speaking and as a you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.049" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">the way he operates I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.210" end="00:51:04.849" style="s2">very similar they may overlap in some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:08.940" style="s2">the subject matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.849" end="00:51:11.010" style="s2">yeah Terence just wasn&#39;t involved in I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.940" end="00:51:14.039" style="s2">mean he gave talks in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.010" end="00:51:15.869" style="s2">underground world of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.039" end="00:51:19.890" style="s2">interested in psychedelics at places</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.869" end="00:51:22.020" style="s2">like the Esalen Institute and he was on</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.890" end="00:51:25.950" style="s2">I was once with him on a radio show in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.020" end="00:51:28.559" style="s2">Los Angeles and he is called KPFK which</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.950" end="00:51:33.150" style="s2">he was on the slot that ran from 2 a.m.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.559" end="00:51:34.740" style="s2">to 6 a.m. and and and in that slot he</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.150" end="00:51:37.470" style="s2">said you know most of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.740" end="00:51:40.020" style="s2">listen to me are insomniacs and you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.470" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">say anything at that time of night so it</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.020" end="00:51:44.670" style="s2">was very much the kind of underground</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:47.819" style="s2">sort of outlaw Robin Hood type image</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.670" end="00:51:50.520" style="s2">that he had whereas Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.819" end="00:51:53.069" style="s2">engaged in mainstream polemics with</p>
