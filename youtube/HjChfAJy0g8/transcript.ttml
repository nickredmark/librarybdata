<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:07.649" style="s2">of us the pandemic has caused some some</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.190" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">dramatic and large shifts in life but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.649" end="00:01:11.399" style="s2">find that that extra just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:13.259" style="s2">different for everybody in their worlds</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.399" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">how is your world been altered or</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.259" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">changed are there things that have</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:20.190" style="s2">changed the levels of importance and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:24.539" style="s2">urgency for you yeah what&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.190" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">on over there for you it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.539" end="00:01:32.099" style="s2">having been communicating with people</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">about the risk of large-scale global</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.099" end="00:01:37.440" style="s2">catastrophes for a long time versus</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:40.319" style="s2">being in one that is happening in terms</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.440" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">of people&#39;s general ability to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.319" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">reality of it and at this point the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">actual risk from the virus itself is</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">relatively small compared to the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:58.319" style="s2">our responses to the virus so when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">talking about things like shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.319" end="00:02:01.800" style="s2">travel which makes sense if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">viral transmission thing but in ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.800" end="00:02:07.709" style="s2">that don&#39;t protect food supply issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">and then damaging the pesticides getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.709" end="00:02:12.470" style="s2">to northern Africa and parts the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">East so locusts take over the food and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.470" end="00:02:16.260" style="s2">restaurants not being able to be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:18.300" style="s2">major importers of food and not having</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">other supply chain possibilities and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:23.550" style="s2">you know damaging the food supply for</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">two billion people is a bigger deal then</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.550" end="00:02:28.730" style="s2">the viruses itself in terms of actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2">risk to life so is the in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.730" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">authoritarian ISM of states breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:39.180" style="s2">international alliances increase in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:41.910" style="s2">state-based and corporate based</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.180" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">surveillance capabilities escalation</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.910" end="00:02:46.680" style="s2">pathways towards violence so you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:49.410" style="s2">we&#39;re in a the situation was like Co vid</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.680" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">was just a big enough thing that it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.410" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">able to set off a cascade of things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:56.610" style="s2">were all that would have been set off by</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:03:02.090" style="s2">something right because there was all</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.610" end="00:03:02.090" style="s2">these systemic fragilities and so now</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:08.090" style="s2">people&#39;s relationship to the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.860" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">global catastrophic risk is different</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.090" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">yeah and and you know how does that does</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">that alter your work at all you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">been working on the things you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">working on is there any change of focus</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">or change of urgency or anything for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:26.450" style="s2">right now yeah I mean there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">a lot more people who are more ready to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.450" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">take the conversation seriously so</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">accelerated for us there&#39;s also a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.639" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">things that have to happen on relatively</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:38.940" style="s2">quick timelines where they reach points</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:41.970" style="s2">of irreversibility so there&#39;s a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.940" end="00:03:43.880" style="s2">my focus and work that has happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.970" end="00:03:45.959" style="s2">because of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.880" end="00:03:49.230" style="s2">responding to kovat is intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">right and I&#39;m way more than responding</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.230" end="00:03:54.120" style="s2">to global ecological crisis or AI risk</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:55.889" style="s2">or anything else was its intelligible in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.120" end="00:03:58.200" style="s2">a different way and eminence right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.889" end="00:04:00.060" style="s2">timely and having government funds</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:03.180" style="s2">allocated to it and all the new cycles</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.060" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">and things like that and so insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.180" end="00:04:06.359" style="s2">responding to Kove it also means</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:10.470" style="s2">responding to the second-order effects</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.359" end="00:04:12.030" style="s2">associated with Co vid there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.470" end="00:04:16.820" style="s2">more institutional conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">happening that are at least kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.820" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">thinking about some things a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:28.349" style="s2">better far from adequate so at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:31.020" style="s2">time I would say that the general</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.349" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">information ecology has gotten much much</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.020" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">worse I mean it was already completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">fragmented but and I would say one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:43.350" style="s2">the things it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">most concerning to me and we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.350" end="00:04:48.360" style="s2">some work towards trying to help with</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:50.190" style="s2">this is the mismatch between the actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.360" end="00:04:52.020" style="s2">complexity of the problems facing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:55.160" style="s2">world and the complexity that most</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.020" end="00:04:58.680" style="s2">people can actually process on their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.160" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">so most people want relatively simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.680" end="00:05:04.290" style="s2">narratives and so that you see this in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:05.910" style="s2">bipartisan politics is that they want</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.290" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">some kind of who the good guys are and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.910" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">who the bad guys are and they either</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:15.510" style="s2">want that the General Authorities are</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">generally good and the virus is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.510" end="00:05:19.470" style="s2">serious and we should kind of listen to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">the authorities and stay home and or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.470" end="00:05:23.729" style="s2">General Authorities are probably bad and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">this is a attempt to take all our civil</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.729" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">liberties away and the virus is probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:31.410" style="s2">exaggerated and the nuance of like well</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.850" style="s2">the virus is serious and there are real</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.410" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">serious responses that need to happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.850" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">there&#39;s also a lot of predatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">opportunism that various power actors</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">have there&#39;s a distribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">goodness and badness of authorities</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:46.889" style="s2">towards different goals the the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.780" style="s2">reality of it is just much more fucking</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.889" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">nuanced and complex and not a simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.780" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">narrative arc and then when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:06:00.270" style="s2">the science of like so how what is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:02.070" style="s2">actual case fatality rate is this just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:03.900" style="s2">flu is it more serious than the flu the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.070" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">epidemiology is not totally trivial</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.900" end="00:06:08.729" style="s2">right to actually understand wait are we</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">doing background tests on non</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.729" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">symptomatic people and is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:14.070" style="s2">immunological assay of the right kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:16.289" style="s2">and does it what are the false positives</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.070" end="00:06:18.199" style="s2">and negatives and and then people will</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.289" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">start talking about the association of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.199" end="00:06:23.010" style="s2">5-g or maybe it&#39;s not really a virus</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">it&#39;s an exosome well most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.010" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">have enough molecular biology to be able</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">to answer that and so then whoever it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:33.599" style="s2">it starts trending on Facebook because</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">it hits some emotional tropes ends up</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.599" end="00:06:37.590" style="s2">being what gets shared and echo-chamber</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:39.090" style="s2">effective and it&#39;s emotional and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.590" end="00:06:40.979" style="s2">consequential and people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.090" end="00:06:43.710" style="s2">spending more time trying to sense make</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.979" end="00:06:45.720" style="s2">while coming up with worse answers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.710" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">then also wanting to act on AI wanting</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.720" end="00:06:49.289" style="s2">to take their guns and go out in front</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:51.270" style="s2">of the protest building or wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.289" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">get Facebook and Google to shut down all</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.790" end="00:06:57.300" style="s2">which are all basically escalations</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.860" end="00:07:01.050" style="s2">towards violence of different types all</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:03.420" style="s2">based on wrong information and theirs is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.050" end="00:07:05.160" style="s2">their I mean this is the economy the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.420" end="00:07:07.350" style="s2">information ecology so damaged that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.160" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">there&#39;s little or no hope of actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.350" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">getting good information right now I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:23.790" style="s2">think that what it takes to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.050" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">actionable intelligence to get enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.790" end="00:07:28.500" style="s2">information that your action on it will</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:31.200" style="s2">actually be appropriate action is a</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.200" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">than most people have yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.230" end="00:07:39.420" style="s2">the tricky thing yeah and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:40.920" style="s2">have trust somewhere then we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.420" end="00:07:42.810" style="s2">have to trust we&#39;re gonna have to if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.920" end="00:07:45.780" style="s2">can&#39;t do it for ourselves and either we</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.810" end="00:07:47.550" style="s2">have go with an understanding that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.780" end="00:07:50.810" style="s2">not going to ever have good sense making</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.550" end="00:07:53.220" style="s2">or we have to trust somebody&#39;s analysis</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.810" end="00:07:56.430" style="s2">we have to trust our own discernment</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.220" end="00:07:58.110" style="s2">capacity to know who we trust right like</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.430" end="00:08:00.420" style="s2">this is true in personal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.110" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2">if you trusted somebody and got hurt</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.420" end="00:08:05.100" style="s2">because they embezzled from you or</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.940" end="00:08:07.200" style="s2">cheated on you or whatever it is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.100" end="00:08:08.790" style="s2">a deeper question around why did you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.200" end="00:08:10.260" style="s2">trust them if they were not actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.790" end="00:08:12.270" style="s2">trustworthy which is trusting your own</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.260" end="00:08:13.800" style="s2">capacity for discernment and their it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.270" end="00:08:15.510" style="s2">might be trustworthiness of intent but</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.800" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">also trustworthiness of capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.510" end="00:08:19.470" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:21.900" style="s2">so to the degree that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.470" end="00:08:23.970" style="s2">cognitively offload some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.900" end="00:08:27.390" style="s2">complexity to someone else I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.970" end="00:08:29.220" style="s2">ultimately responsible for what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.390" end="00:08:30.480" style="s2">believe in the consequence of my actions</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.480" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">or right and so what level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.349" end="00:08:39.479" style="s2">understanding do I need when experts in</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:44.730" style="s2">the field disagree to even decide where</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.479" end="00:08:47.190" style="s2">I trust well and I think another</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.730" end="00:08:51.960" style="s2">question to be asking around that is how</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.190" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">can we discern a person&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.960" end="00:08:58.530" style="s2">articulate the complexity as an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:00.150" style="s2">truth or a part of our truth that we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.530" end="00:09:02.400" style="s2">put into our baskets then later</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.150" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">synthesized and not blindly agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.400" end="00:09:07.590" style="s2">because of the poetic feelings I believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2">that the emotional pole</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.590" end="00:09:12.840" style="s2">that it allows me to feel and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.250" end="00:09:15.630" style="s2">you know I I have to admit that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.840" end="00:09:17.340" style="s2">these conscious quote-unquote conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.630" end="00:09:19.950" style="s2">conversations around what&#39;s happening to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.340" end="00:09:22.590" style="s2">these little pandemics people want to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.950" end="00:09:25.160" style="s2">agreeable with someone who has that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.590" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">ability to articulate complexities</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.160" end="00:09:31.080" style="s2">mostly for the sake of because it allows</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:32.610" style="s2">them to have some sort of validity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.080" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">making them feel smarter or more</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.610" end="00:09:36.900" style="s2">included in that narrative which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">really not the reason why you would want</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.900" end="00:09:42.150" style="s2">to agree to someone&#39;s material in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:45.390" style="s2">first place and then what happens is we</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.150" end="00:09:47.820" style="s2">get a lot of blind knowledge nodding and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.390" end="00:09:49.530" style="s2">agreeably to what&#39;s happening for</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.820" end="00:09:52.200" style="s2">somebody and then that becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.530" end="00:09:54.090" style="s2">general narrative that leads into maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.200" end="00:09:56.760" style="s2">sometimes a misled group of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.090" end="00:09:59.430" style="s2">taking unreasonable action in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.760" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">and you know we have enough of those</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.430" end="00:10:03.540" style="s2">clusters going around and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:07.710" style="s2">everybody going in every which way</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.540" end="00:10:09.870" style="s2">direction with a spoon fed and self</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.710" end="00:10:14.780" style="s2">imposed righteousness attached to it in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.870" end="00:10:19.530" style="s2">some way and so I&#39;m curious how can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.780" end="00:10:23.190" style="s2">build our capacities better to bring a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.530" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">higher level of balance into what it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.190" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">that we can collectively do and pose the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">the question to even have a question</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:37.500" style="s2">about the information that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:42.120" style="s2">as we continue this this journey</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.500" end="00:10:45.420" style="s2">together yeah you as to how question and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.120" end="00:10:47.580" style="s2">there&#39;s some very basic things that will</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.420" end="00:10:50.850" style="s2">create some traction it&#39;s not the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.580" end="00:10:52.350" style="s2">answer but basic things first I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.850" end="00:10:58.890" style="s2">something about agreeableness since you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.350" end="00:11:02.780" style="s2">mentioned that that the spirit of good</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.890" end="00:11:08.070" style="s2">sense making of good epistemology is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.780" end="00:11:10.650" style="s2">earnest desire to know and so bias of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.070" end="00:11:14.870" style="s2">any kind is the enemy of science or</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.650" end="00:11:17.130" style="s2">epistemology or or sense making right</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.870" end="00:11:19.790" style="s2">agreeableness and disagreeableness are</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.130" end="00:11:19.790" style="s2">both biases</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.180" end="00:11:24.200" style="s2">and their relational biases to relate in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:25.490" style="s2">a particular way with the person but</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.200" end="00:11:28.250" style="s2">that also means relating with their</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.490" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">information in a way that predisposes a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.250" end="00:11:32.350" style="s2">particular kind of relationship to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:34.370" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.350" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">independent of what the actual truth of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.370" end="00:11:38.990" style="s2">it is so there are people who like to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:40.850" style="s2">disagreeable who will just figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.990" end="00:11:43.700" style="s2">how to devil&#39;s advocate you no matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.850" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">what that&#39;s not that useful right</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.700" end="00:11:49.880" style="s2">because that&#39;s a lot of waste of time</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:51.860" style="s2">and energy if what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.880" end="00:11:53.060" style="s2">actually true and they should and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.860" end="00:11:55.490" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have that bias they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.060" end="00:12:00.280" style="s2">like oh yeah that actually makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.490" end="00:12:02.410" style="s2">and agree ability similarly leads to</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.910" end="00:12:12.260" style="s2">thinking and so I really like for people</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.490" end="00:12:15.800" style="s2">to not have either of those biases as</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.500" end="00:12:38.300" style="s2">both because we&#39;re super immature right</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.790" end="00:12:43.870" style="s2">and so it&#39;s important in a healthy</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.870" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">well I can see why you came to that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.459" end="00:12:50.690" style="s2">like I can there&#39;s a lot in that that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:52.250" style="s2">interesting I come to a different take</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.709" end="00:15:33.909" style="s2">like I&#39;m not gonna learn everything they</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.879" end="00:15:54.019" style="s2">space as well I have more epistemic</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.209" end="00:16:00.199" style="s2">I can see something between them with</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.790" end="00:16:29.179" style="s2">I think that I think we we kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.709" end="00:16:30.679" style="s2">like we must know or must have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.179" end="00:16:32.749" style="s2">opinion especially about this kovat</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.679" end="00:16:35.470" style="s2">thing it seems that and then maybe</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.470" end="00:16:40.759" style="s2">polemic of info war in generals it makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.989" end="00:16:43.129" style="s2">us feel like we have to pick a side and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.759" end="00:16:44.449" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know means that maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.129" end="00:16:47.660" style="s2">don&#39;t care or something like that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.449" end="00:16:50.119" style="s2">think that maybe it&#39;s a it&#39;s a higher</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.660" end="00:16:52.179" style="s2">order of answer period and then the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.119" end="00:16:55.669" style="s2">second thing I got on that Daniel is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.179" end="00:16:57.169" style="s2">if I want to know it requires an</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.669" end="00:16:58.819" style="s2">investment so it has to be important to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.169" end="00:17:00.350" style="s2">me and so that means there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.819" end="00:17:02.899" style="s2">whole categories of since making them</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.350" end="00:17:04.519" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t engage in and and I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.899" end="00:17:07.279" style="s2">have big pieces of things that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.519" end="00:17:09.319" style="s2">know about and then in regards to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.279" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">something that I may be wanting to put</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.319" end="00:17:13.370" style="s2">into the world or some action I might</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:15.289" style="s2">want to take it might be really really</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.370" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">important for me to invest the time to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.289" end="00:17:19.850" style="s2">know in the way you&#39;re talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:23.419" style="s2">I think that&#39;s really valuable a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.850" end="00:17:24.829" style="s2">valuable piece if I want to get buff or</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.419" end="00:17:27.409" style="s2">I want to learn to paint well or I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.829" end="00:17:28.669" style="s2">to play the piano there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.409" end="00:17:30.380" style="s2">between I want that and I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.669" end="00:17:33.529" style="s2">do it well which is called a shit ton of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.380" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">training yeah and so coming to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.529" end="00:17:38.149" style="s2">understand biology and biology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:40.399" style="s2">epidemiology and coming to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.149" end="00:17:42.620" style="s2">political science and economic theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.399" end="00:17:44.769" style="s2">well are not trivial right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.620" end="00:17:47.299" style="s2">especially to try to have some grand</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.769" end="00:17:51.080" style="s2">narratives that synthesize knowing all</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.299" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">of those things together now if I say I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:56.269" style="s2">don&#39;t know it could be seen as I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.580" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">care I generally take it and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.269" end="00:17:58.730" style="s2">that is right someone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:01.409" style="s2">because they really don&#39;t give a shit</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.730" end="00:18:03.720" style="s2">but it can also be that you care more I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.409" end="00:18:06.330" style="s2">actually care so much that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.720" end="00:18:09.690" style="s2">willing to have false confidence that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.330" end="00:18:11.490" style="s2">biases me because once I start to have I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:12.870" style="s2">think I know now I just have</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.490" end="00:18:14.220" style="s2">confirmation bias where I look for</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.870" end="00:18:15.419" style="s2">things that confirm that and throw out</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.220" end="00:18:18.150" style="s2">the other things and surround myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.419" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">with people that agree with me and if I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.150" end="00:18:22.200" style="s2">really care that&#39;s the worst thing I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.730" end="00:18:23.549" style="s2">could do I ruined my ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.200" end="00:18:25.740" style="s2">connected to reality at that point</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.549" end="00:18:27.929" style="s2">instead wanting to just get confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.740" end="00:18:29.159" style="s2">of a particular type of social signal</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.929" end="00:18:32.340" style="s2">from a particular audience that will</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.159" end="00:18:35.789" style="s2">confirm that for me and so I&#39;d much</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.340" end="00:18:37.080" style="s2">rather be able to say I really care and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.789" end="00:18:39.809" style="s2">I really don&#39;t know and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.530" end="00:20:14.220" style="s2">know obviously there&#39;s a health</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.820" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">impact for some people there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.220" end="00:20:22.440" style="s2">economic and you know political impacts</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.120" end="00:20:25.320" style="s2">and then an uncertain future impacts is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.440" end="00:20:26.850" style="s2">is really I think one place that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.320" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">many of us are standing especially as we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.850" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">starting to look out there like six</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.310" style="s2">months or a year or two years three</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:34.110" style="s2">years like you know in an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.310" end="00:20:35.400" style="s2">either a predict the future which I you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.110" end="00:20:38.490" style="s2">know we&#39;re not a very big fan of but</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.400" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">when you actually start looking at you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.490" end="00:20:41.580" style="s2">know being generative with your ideas</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:45.270" style="s2">about the future and what might be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.580" end="00:20:47.370" style="s2">better state you know what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.270" end="00:20:50.250" style="s2">kind of have to offer us and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.370" end="00:20:51.870" style="s2">like you know where are we at now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.250" end="00:20:54.630" style="s2">and what is some of the things that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.870" end="00:20:56.730" style="s2">that are some of the forces that are at</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.630" end="00:21:00.060" style="s2">work at defining what our near-term</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:02.070" style="s2">future might look like six 12 18 months</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.060" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">and then really what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.070" end="00:21:06.750" style="s2">alterations that are that there&#39;s actors</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:08.520" style="s2">out there pushing on us and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.750" end="00:21:10.170" style="s2">some things that you&#39;re thinking of or</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.520" end="00:21:12.360" style="s2">we might think of that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.170" end="00:21:14.340" style="s2">desirable state to move towards after</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.360" end="00:21:18.180" style="s2">this this pandemic or after this period</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.340" end="00:21:21.510" style="s2">of disruption if we just think about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.180" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">pandemic and the whole conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.510" end="00:21:30.120" style="s2">around return to normal a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">have been really profoundly damaged</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.120" end="00:21:37.740" style="s2">already and and I don&#39;t just mean people</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:39.330" style="s2">who died right and family members and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.740" end="00:21:41.900" style="s2">emotions and those who depended on them</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.330" end="00:21:46.530" style="s2">financially and all of those things oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.900" end="00:21:49.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a big deal but the number of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.530" end="00:21:52.440" style="s2">small businesses that closed the small</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.500" end="00:21:53.700" style="s2">businesses go out of business for</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.440" end="00:21:55.290" style="s2">something like this it&#39;s a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.700" end="00:21:57.390" style="s2">cutting down an old-growth forest you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.290" end="00:21:59.220" style="s2">just can&#39;t regrow quickly you can fail a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.390" end="00:22:00.660" style="s2">business that has small margins much</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.220" end="00:22:03.450" style="s2">faster than you can regrow a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.660" end="00:22:05.790" style="s2">new ones now huge businesses can come in</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.450" end="00:22:09.390" style="s2">who have war chests and start to buy up</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.790" end="00:22:12.420" style="s2">that space so that represents you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.390" end="00:22:15.060" style="s2">one of the most severe consolidation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.420" end="00:22:18.450" style="s2">wealth possibilities that we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.060" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">seen similarly when the market crashes</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.450" end="00:22:23.790" style="s2">and all of the real infrastructural</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">value stocks are really cheap so those</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.790" end="00:22:27.100" style="s2">who have a bunch of liquid</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:28.540" style="s2">can buy them all up that&#39;s again massive</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.100" end="00:22:31.660" style="s2">consolidation of wealth on what was</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:36.250" style="s2">already an unsustainable economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.660" end="00:22:38.800" style="s2">inequality we see that the GDP went down</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.250" end="00:22:41.530" style="s2">but the debt went up and we already had</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.800" end="00:22:45.630" style="s2">more of our GDP debt servicing than was</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.530" end="00:22:50.860" style="s2">sustainable and so that represents</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.630" end="00:22:53.920" style="s2">basically a you know a fatal blow to an</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.860" end="00:22:57.700" style="s2">already mostly dead system what happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.920" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">from that and then we start to look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.700" end="00:23:02.950" style="s2">the damage that&#39;s happened to the EU as</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:05.950" style="s2">a system and what that means for Eurasia</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.950" end="00:23:08.230" style="s2">and the belt and road initiative and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.950" end="00:23:13.900" style="s2">know so many things like that we start</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.230" end="00:23:15.790" style="s2">to look at food supply chains so if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.900" end="00:23:17.559" style="s2">just got let&#39;s say that we got a magical</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.790" end="00:23:20.679" style="s2">vaccine tomorrow we won&#39;t but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.559" end="00:23:23.770" style="s2">we did we&#39;d be returning into a world</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.679" end="00:23:26.200" style="s2">that was radically damaged not by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.770" end="00:23:31.260" style="s2">virus but by all of the second third</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.200" end="00:23:34.179" style="s2">order effects so if we want to return to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.260" end="00:23:35.830" style="s2">a not really damaged world we have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.179" end="00:23:37.510" style="s2">fix not just the virus but fix those</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.830" end="00:23:40.420" style="s2">other things and what it takes to fix</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.510" end="00:23:41.890" style="s2">those would require a level of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.420" end="00:23:43.630" style="s2">understanding them so would require</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.890" end="00:23:45.490" style="s2">better sense making and way the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.630" end="00:23:48.580" style="s2">better coordination ie governance at</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.490" end="00:23:50.350" style="s2">both you know nation-state levels</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.580" end="00:23:53.710" style="s2">between public and private sector and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.350" end="00:23:55.690" style="s2">internationally and if we got that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.710" end="00:23:57.940" style="s2">could make it much much much better</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.690" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">right because those are those would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.940" end="00:24:02.650" style="s2">significant changes to the core</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:06.910" style="s2">civilization systems so we will come out</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.650" end="00:24:08.590" style="s2">of this different and it will either be</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.910" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">meaningfully worse or meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.590" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">better in terms of the overall health</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:17.920" style="s2">and integrity of the global Commons and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">systems and then looking out beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.920" end="00:24:22.600" style="s2">time or looking at is that is this this</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.470" end="00:24:25.780" style="s2">thing that I mean I just want my really</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.600" end="00:24:28.600" style="s2">clear flat simple question is this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.780" end="00:24:31.420" style="s2">this an opportunity for systems upgrades</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.600" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">or championing things that might be of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.420" end="00:24:37.890" style="s2">long-term benefit to humanity and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.890" style="s2">planet yes of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:43.490" style="s2">you mentioned when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.920" end="00:24:45.410" style="s2">earlier about you know the frame that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.490" end="00:24:49.730" style="s2">some people are holding of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.410" end="00:24:51.260" style="s2">pause that this is right well the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.730" end="00:24:52.730" style="s2">powerful actors in the world not only</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.260" end="00:24:58.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have a pause they&#39;ve increased</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.730" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">their activity many fold right the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.820" end="00:25:04.070" style="s2">Kremlin and the CCP and the DNC and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:06.350" style="s2">GOP they&#39;re not paused right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.070" end="00:25:08.360" style="s2">fucking power grabbing like crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.350" end="00:25:12.110" style="s2">trying to advance their agendas and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.360" end="00:25:15.140" style="s2">doing so with really asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.110" end="00:25:17.150" style="s2">information capabilities and capital</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.140" end="00:25:21.230" style="s2">capabilities and team capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.150" end="00:25:22.970" style="s2">actuation capabilities so anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.230" end="00:25:24.980" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s a great pause that also</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.970" end="00:25:31.790" style="s2">says where you are in the food chain</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.980" end="00:25:35.330" style="s2">kind of what&#39;s influencing the world so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.790" end="00:25:37.850" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.330" end="00:25:40.160" style="s2">being advanced that and when you mention</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.850" end="00:25:42.950" style="s2">opportunity that some people are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.160" end="00:25:45.020" style="s2">as opportunities to advance their</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.950" end="00:25:47.150" style="s2">personal interests in ways they&#39;re bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.020" end="00:25:50.690" style="s2">for the interests of others are the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.150" end="00:25:53.090" style="s2">whole so there are some people who for</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.690" end="00:25:55.100" style="s2">whatever reason really believe in or</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.090" end="00:25:58.250" style="s2">like or are aesthetically attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.100" end="00:26:01.400" style="s2">authoritarian type structures so when</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.250" end="00:26:02.870" style="s2">you see you know the President of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.400" end="00:26:04.940" style="s2">Philippines when it was time for</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.870" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">quarantine just so happily taken say yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.940" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">shoot people who are violating</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.980" style="s2">quarantine it just appeals to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:13.250" style="s2">sensibility like his to take</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.980" end="00:26:16.820" style="s2">authoritarian measures of those kinds so</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.250" end="00:26:18.740" style="s2">and in more technologically advanced</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.820" end="00:26:21.650" style="s2">countries those same people are looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.740" end="00:26:24.260" style="s2">at implementing massive thermal scans</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.650" end="00:26:27.080" style="s2">and AI drone type capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.260" end="00:26:29.030" style="s2">surveillance capabilities and how much</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.080" end="00:26:33.050" style="s2">is just their own personal economic</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.030" end="00:26:36.170" style="s2">incentive associated being the major you</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.050" end="00:26:38.330" style="s2">know funders or or owners of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.170" end="00:26:40.670" style="s2">companies and those technologies versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.330" end="00:26:44.210" style="s2">is it aligned with political agendas or</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.670" end="00:26:46.160" style="s2">ideological agendas so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.210" end="00:26:48.530" style="s2">people pursuing opportunities but that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.160" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">are not the opportunities that we would</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.530" end="00:26:50.550" style="s2">say create the highest quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:53.040" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.550" end="00:26:58.170" style="s2">everybody in a good in in what I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.040" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">call a good sense making frame now there</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.170" end="00:27:02.310" style="s2">are some people doing things that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:04.560" style="s2">authentically really interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.310" end="00:27:06.570" style="s2">now and it could move things in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.560" end="00:27:07.860" style="s2">right direction but they are not they</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.570" end="00:27:12.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have as much resource they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.860" end="00:27:14.550" style="s2">as well coordinated so as the food</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.270" end="00:27:17.420" style="s2">supply chains break this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.550" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">interesting one right so we see the</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:25.340" style="s2">sanitized term right : of all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.860" end="00:27:29.700" style="s2">chickens and the pigs and like that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.340" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">burying the potatoes and pouring down</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.700" end="00:27:33.150" style="s2">the drain all the milk</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:34.770" style="s2">just as many people exist that need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.150" end="00:27:36.540" style="s2">eat like what the fuck why are we</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.770" end="00:27:38.970" style="s2">destroying all the supply when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.540" end="00:27:40.770" style="s2">just as much aggregate demand it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.970" end="00:27:43.260" style="s2">the demand used to go to McDonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.770" end="00:27:44.520" style="s2">right it used to go to a few major</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.260" end="00:27:46.200" style="s2">distribution centers when those</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.520" end="00:27:47.850" style="s2">distribution centers can&#39;t get it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.200" end="00:27:50.790" style="s2">you&#39;re operating on relatively tighter</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.850" end="00:27:53.280" style="s2">margins then the supply side is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.790" end="00:27:54.780" style="s2">well we can&#39;t keep paying for these pigs</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.280" end="00:27:57.060" style="s2">or these chickens if we can&#39;t sell stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.780" end="00:27:58.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s actually cheaper for us to just</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.060" end="00:28:00.300" style="s2">kill them and destroy them but then all</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.200" end="00:28:02.700" style="s2">the people still need food and like</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.300" end="00:28:04.560" style="s2">that&#39;s just a supply chain issue right</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.700" end="00:28:06.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a supply intelligence so just can</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.560" end="00:28:10.530" style="s2">we get the supply to the demand through</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.030" end="00:28:12.690" style="s2">a different route well the longer the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.530" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">route is the easy the more steps there</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.690" end="00:28:18.630" style="s2">are they can damage it so the movement</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:20.370" style="s2">to say well we should actually have food</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.630" end="00:28:23.340" style="s2">supply be more distributed and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.370" end="00:28:25.050" style="s2">local oh and by the way if it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.340" end="00:28:26.520" style="s2">local there won&#39;t be factory farms</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.050" end="00:28:27.450" style="s2">because nobody wants to be around a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.520" end="00:28:29.580" style="s2">factory farm because they&#39;re fucking</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.450" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">horrible and so you have to put them</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.580" end="00:28:32.970" style="s2">somewhere far away and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:35.460" style="s2">that means it&#39;s centralized shipping to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.970" end="00:28:37.830" style="s2">everywhere else so does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.460" end="00:28:39.660" style="s2">we can get better Ethical Treatment of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.830" end="00:28:41.240" style="s2">Animals better environmental care better</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.660" end="00:28:43.740" style="s2">health for the people and better</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.240" end="00:28:45.990" style="s2">robustness and resiliency of the food</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.740" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">supply grid simultaneously yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.990" end="00:28:49.980" style="s2">that should happen right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:51.710" style="s2">some totally inadequate but some</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.980" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">movements happening in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.710" end="00:28:57.480" style="s2">this is an interesting one because this</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:59.310" style="s2">is something where like anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.480" end="00:29:01.500" style="s2">engage to some degree right you can just</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.310" end="00:29:02.790" style="s2">say I&#39;m gonna do a home garden right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.500" end="00:29:04.380" style="s2">that&#39;s engaging to some degree or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.790" end="00:29:06.030" style="s2">gonna help a community garden in our air</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.380" end="00:29:08.280" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna help our small towns start</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.030" end="00:29:10.620" style="s2">working on local resilience like can we</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.280" end="00:29:12.540" style="s2">get a couple people to start engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.620" end="00:29:15.150" style="s2">growing stuff for this region as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.540" end="00:29:18.630" style="s2">to everything being based on import and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.150" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">export and so there&#39;s like there&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.630" end="00:29:22.980" style="s2">local shit you can do to engage in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:24.900" style="s2">at the same time there&#39;s stuff that some</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.980" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">people need to do to sake who have real</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.900" end="00:29:30.230" style="s2">supply chain capabilities and enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.850" end="00:29:32.670" style="s2">money to front the costs to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.230" end="00:29:33.480" style="s2">you know meet the supply and demand</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.670" end="00:29:38.760" style="s2">where it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.480" end="00:29:39.930" style="s2">so for every one of the places where it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.760" end="00:29:42.570" style="s2">could go really bad there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.930" end="00:29:45.300" style="s2">opportunity right the kids not being at</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.570" end="00:29:47.250" style="s2">school and the combination of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.300" end="00:29:49.680" style="s2">getting way more screen addiction as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.250" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">result of more domestic abuse happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.680" end="00:29:56.100" style="s2">as a result of damage happening in their</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.960" style="s2">social development like that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.100" end="00:29:59.790" style="s2">bad actually when you think about what</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.960" end="00:30:03.870" style="s2">that means for a generation is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.790" end="00:30:05.700" style="s2">bad but the opportunity to say fuck</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.870" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">let&#39;s we have to fix that and while</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.700" end="00:30:09.090" style="s2">we&#39;re fixing it let&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:11.070" style="s2">rethink education from scratch and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.090" end="00:30:13.080" style="s2">do we if we were gonna be delivering</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.070" end="00:30:14.820" style="s2">education not to the legacy system how</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.080" end="00:30:19.410" style="s2">would we do it that&#39;s a pretty awesome</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.820" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">opportunity a bunch of jobs go away and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.410" end="00:30:22.830" style="s2">we realize wow there was a bunch of jobs</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:24.450" style="s2">that were really just bullshit jobs</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.830" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">right like there were just make work</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.450" end="00:30:29.160" style="s2">kind of jobs well if those people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:31.950" style="s2">feed their families they don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.160" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">because like it was meeting some need</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.950" end="00:30:38.790" style="s2">but we also get to say can we start to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:40.770" style="s2">rethink our like what productive and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.790" end="00:30:43.710" style="s2">meaningful work and how people get there</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.770" end="00:30:45.420" style="s2">you know finances Medora so I&#39;d say if</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.710" end="00:30:47.430" style="s2">you go across the sector&#39;s just take</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.420" end="00:30:50.790" style="s2">health care take you know pick every</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.430" end="00:30:52.380" style="s2">sector and say what are the risks in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.790" end="00:30:55.530" style="s2">this space and what harm has already</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.380" end="00:30:57.480" style="s2">happened and associated with that to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.530" end="00:30:58.980" style="s2">solve the harm to prevent the risks and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.480" end="00:31:00.210" style="s2">to make it better what would better look</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.980" end="00:31:04.040" style="s2">like what are the opportunities in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.210" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">space that&#39;s a valuable thought process</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.040" end="00:31:09.900" style="s2">great so let&#39;s think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:11.910" style="s2">somebody might be watching this this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.900" end="00:31:14.460" style="s2">video right now Dan Yellin and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.910" end="00:31:18.210" style="s2">that there may be theirs they&#39;ve they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.460" end="00:31:20.220" style="s2">kind of got some of the harm in for work</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.210" end="00:31:22.800" style="s2">has done to our information ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.220" end="00:31:25.140" style="s2">they have a sense that I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.800" end="00:31:27.210" style="s2">difficult to make sense but they have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.140" end="00:31:30.330" style="s2">longing or like just a general feeling</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.210" end="00:31:32.340" style="s2">if they want to be of service you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.330" end="00:31:34.470" style="s2">right now no how did that how do they</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.340" end="00:31:35.850" style="s2">get started I mean like like and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.470" end="00:31:37.230" style="s2">talked we&#39;re talking you know through</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.850" end="00:31:38.940" style="s2">the years a lot about consciousness what</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.230" end="00:31:41.040" style="s2">we mean by raising consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.940" end="00:31:43.590" style="s2">they&#39;re like what are what are some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.040" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">those things right now this is a moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.590" end="00:31:49.350" style="s2">where we get to retake we get to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:51.900" style="s2">stock where our lives and think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.350" end="00:31:55.470" style="s2">how we might reconstitute ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.900" end="00:31:56.850" style="s2">differently than than before you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.470" end="00:31:59.580" style="s2">what are some of the things that that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.850" end="00:32:00.900" style="s2">can look to what are the steps that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.580" end="00:32:03.960" style="s2">might be able to take to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.900" end="00:32:06.150" style="s2">participate meaningfully in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:16.250" style="s2">works better or ultimately a thriving</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.150" end="00:32:20.160" style="s2">room and pause because I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.250" end="00:32:23.610" style="s2">statistically that whatever I say even</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.160" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">if it is inspiring won&#39;t make it through</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.610" end="00:32:27.000" style="s2">people&#39;s memory after they scroll</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:29.930" style="s2">Facebook or Instagram the first time or</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.000" end="00:32:35.070" style="s2">get on a phone called it&#39;s stressful and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.930" end="00:32:37.940" style="s2">so inspiration that isn&#39;t gonna last</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.070" end="00:32:41.520" style="s2">through a bunch of hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.940" end="00:32:45.030" style="s2">not worth so much so if I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.520" end="00:32:46.410" style="s2">what could people do and they would feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.030" end="00:32:47.670" style="s2">inspired after this but then they would</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.410" end="00:32:49.920" style="s2">lose it the first thing I want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.670" end="00:32:51.660" style="s2">well and what could you do to not lose</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.920" end="00:32:53.400" style="s2">it what could you do to stay engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.660" end="00:32:55.350" style="s2">a conversation that would keep orienting</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.400" end="00:32:57.480" style="s2">you in the right direction so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.350" end="00:32:59.580" style="s2">kind of meta to the specific thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.480" end="00:33:06.030" style="s2">but it&#39;s how to be engaged in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.580" end="00:33:07.590" style="s2">will keep engaging you so I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.030" end="00:33:13.050" style="s2">I had to pick one thing that would have</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.590" end="00:33:15.510" style="s2">people do is figure out how to engage</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.050" end="00:33:17.070" style="s2">more often with people and content that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.510" end="00:33:18.570" style="s2">are actively doing things that you find</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.070" end="00:33:22.170" style="s2">inspiring that will orient your</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.570" end="00:33:24.690" style="s2">attention continuously that way because</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.170" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">whether it&#39;s Facebook or your family or</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.690" end="00:33:27.270" style="s2">your job or your kids or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:28.680" style="s2">there will be a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.270" end="00:33:31.110" style="s2">orienting you in other directions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.680" end="00:33:31.490" style="s2">being oriented to what is it that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.110" end="00:33:33.590" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.490" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">lately called you know which very much</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.590" end="00:33:37.820" style="s2">might be your kids but from a different</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.950" end="00:34:18.429" style="s2">now say some more specific things if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:22.510" style="s2">want yeah yeah what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.429" end="00:34:25.220" style="s2">so somebody listening to this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.510" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">online marketer and somebody&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.220" end="00:34:28.790" style="s2">accountant and someone&#39;s a construction</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">worker and somebody is a farmer and</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.450" end="00:34:36.020" style="s2">all do the same thing right like they</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.700" end="00:34:37.220" style="s2">have very different skills very</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.020" end="00:34:39.109" style="s2">different knowledge very different</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.220" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">calling and so if I start saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.109" end="00:34:43.250" style="s2">well here&#39;s what we do to restructure</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">global finance well which of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.250" end="00:34:51.260" style="s2">people will that be the really relevant</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:54.490" style="s2">thing for so it&#39;s hard to try to speak</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.260" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">to a very general audience in that way</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.490" end="00:35:02.990" style="s2">so what I would say is whatever level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:05.000" style="s2">expertise you have and whatever kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.990" end="00:35:06.470" style="s2">areas of calling there is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.000" end="00:35:09.170" style="s2">useful shit you can do if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.470" end="00:35:11.060" style="s2">called to do useful things and if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.170" end="00:35:13.010" style="s2">want to do useful things that more scale</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.060" end="00:35:15.560" style="s2">which is totally not the only thing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.010" end="00:35:17.270" style="s2">do because there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.560" end="00:35:19.010" style="s2">for ego reasons want to think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.270" end="00:35:23.300" style="s2">scale while totally neglecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.010" end="00:35:24.380" style="s2">everything around them and so much so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.300" end="00:35:25.970" style="s2">many problems would be better if people</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.380" end="00:35:28.850" style="s2">were just not neglecting what was around</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.970" end="00:35:31.130" style="s2">them then we wouldn&#39;t all be depending</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.850" end="00:35:32.540" style="s2">upon some scaled things solving all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.130" end="00:35:34.280" style="s2">our problems which is what leads to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.540" end="00:35:36.590" style="s2">few companies and organizations running</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.280" end="00:35:38.210" style="s2">the whole world who aren&#39;t close enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.590" end="00:35:41.750" style="s2">to possibly have the optics to know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.210" end="00:35:43.550" style="s2">to be helpful so might be like well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.750" end="00:35:45.170" style="s2">taking care of homeless dogs in my city</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.550" end="00:35:47.990" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t address homeless dogs</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.170" end="00:35:50.119" style="s2">all cities or all animals but it fucking</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.990" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">addresses these ones right and if I can</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.119" end="00:35:53.450" style="s2">after I do that start to put out here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:55.670" style="s2">what we did that was helpful in our city</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.450" end="00:35:57.980" style="s2">for other cities right like those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.670" end="00:35:59.630" style="s2">good steps so right now with Cova</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.980" end="00:36:02.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who are lonely</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:06.230" style="s2">enough that they&#39;re killing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.500" end="00:36:07.579" style="s2">do you and some of them will end up</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.230" end="00:36:12.530" style="s2">being people that you find out about</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.579" end="00:36:14.559" style="s2">that you knew right or who are just</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.530" end="00:36:16.910" style="s2">older people were just really suffering</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.559" end="00:36:18.589" style="s2">so you don&#39;t have to have any very</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.910" end="00:36:21.859" style="s2">specialized knowledge or any high</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.589" end="00:36:23.510" style="s2">profile sense-making to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.859" end="00:36:24.730" style="s2">where there&#39;s need and reach out and be</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.510" end="00:36:30.109" style="s2">responsive to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.730" end="00:36:32.270" style="s2">so that&#39;s a huge thing to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.109" end="00:36:39.109" style="s2">that you feel called to things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.270" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">systemic question it actually because</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.109" end="00:36:44.140" style="s2">it&#39;s probably wrong I&#39;m saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:47.329" style="s2">someone who&#39;s systemically focused but</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.140" end="00:36:48.950" style="s2">partly that is just because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.329" end="00:36:50.750" style="s2">getting local news we&#39;re getting global</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.950" end="00:36:52.430" style="s2">news and so our attention is being</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.750" end="00:36:54.260" style="s2">bombarded by things that aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.430" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">in the world that we&#39;re in and that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.260" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">at a scale that we really can&#39;t fucking</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:00.349" style="s2">do anything about or even know how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:02.180" style="s2">make sense about so it mostly just that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.349" end="00:37:03.859" style="s2">is the narrative warfare at a high level</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.180" end="00:37:06.260" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to get our beliefs so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.859" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">vote and purchase and retweet in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.260" end="00:37:10.880" style="s2">particular way to support those who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:14.900" style="s2">acting at that scale with specific types</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:16.760" style="s2">of agendas and your desire to have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.900" end="00:37:19.430" style="s2">strong opinion and be able to do some</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.760" end="00:37:21.770" style="s2">online warrior shit is largely some</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.430" end="00:37:22.970" style="s2">stronger forces having co-opted you into</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.770" end="00:37:24.250" style="s2">being a soldier for something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.970" end="00:37:27.950" style="s2">even understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.250" end="00:37:30.589" style="s2">well I&#39;m it so it&#39;s often a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.950" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">tactic actually and then an avoidance</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.589" end="00:37:36.530" style="s2">tactic that many of us use to not</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:38.510" style="s2">actually do the work onward for us at a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.530" end="00:37:40.430" style="s2">very very local level that internal</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.510" end="00:37:42.349" style="s2">level the home level the direct</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.430" end="00:37:43.849" style="s2">community level and we distract</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.349" end="00:37:50.020" style="s2">ourselves with so many of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.849" end="00:37:50.020" style="s2">narratives it can be avoidance it can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.290" end="00:37:57.140" style="s2">you know grandiose gratification it can</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.740" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">be simply the addictive I can&#39;t not know</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.140" end="00:38:00.289" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:02.509" style="s2">whatever can be the hyper normal</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.950" end="00:40:10.309" style="s2">invitation for collaboration and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.369" end="00:40:12.349" style="s2">can&#39;t solve it I&#39;m yeah but I and I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.309" end="00:40:12.820" style="s2">think that one of things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.349" end="00:40:16.210" style="s2">skipper</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.820" end="00:40:18.760" style="s2">a lot and I think Rachel I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.210" end="00:40:21.580" style="s2">what you just said is like like when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.760" end="00:40:23.320" style="s2">can collaborate in a local level you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.580" end="00:40:25.390" style="s2">actually coordinate enough people to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.320" end="00:40:28.840" style="s2">have enough range of opinions and views</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.390" end="00:40:32.020" style="s2">and capacities and capabilities it it</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.840" end="00:40:33.880" style="s2">can be difficult but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.020" end="00:40:36.700" style="s2">organizing a hundred people is very</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.880" end="00:40:38.410" style="s2">different than than 4,000 or 5,000 which</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.700" end="00:40:41.890" style="s2">is very very different than 300 million</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.410" end="00:40:44.920" style="s2">or a billion and I think a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.890" end="00:40:46.810" style="s2">especially and a lot of our our world in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.920" end="00:40:48.340" style="s2">our movement is we talk in these really</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.810" end="00:40:51.450" style="s2">grand things and then we don&#39;t even do</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.340" end="00:40:54.610" style="s2">organizing in levels of 10 or 20 or 30</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.450" end="00:40:59.260" style="s2">we&#39;re the big but not actually engaging</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.610" end="00:41:02.230" style="s2">them that the local there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.260" end="00:41:06.700" style="s2">important part of the classically</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.230" end="00:41:08.710" style="s2">left-right conversation the left-right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.700" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">was supposed to be a healthy dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.710" end="00:41:13.210" style="s2">between values that were all important</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:14.340" style="s2">that in the like steel man different</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.210" end="00:41:18.580" style="s2">perspectives right through this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.340" end="00:41:21.340" style="s2">dialectic between rights and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.580" end="00:41:23.560" style="s2">responsibilities between individual and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.340" end="00:41:27.330" style="s2">relationships rather that dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.560" end="00:41:27.330" style="s2">would happen not supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.540" end="00:41:34.750" style="s2">warfare but you have to balance rights</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:36.940" style="s2">and responsibilities in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.750" end="00:41:38.710" style="s2">and either one of them on their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.940" end="00:41:42.130" style="s2">without balance and ZUP becoming</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.710" end="00:41:43.390" style="s2">pathological so if people have rights</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.130" end="00:41:48.430" style="s2">and they don&#39;t have attendant</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.390" end="00:41:52.060" style="s2">responsibilities right so you&#39;re raising</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.430" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">kids they have there&#39;s a right that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.060" end="00:41:55.390" style="s2">have to expect that their parents are</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:57.670" style="s2">gonna feed them and their parents start</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.390" end="00:41:59.170" style="s2">as they have capability progressively</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.670" end="00:42:00.670" style="s2">they start being involved in helping</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.170" end="00:42:02.350" style="s2">wash the dishes and do chores there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.670" end="00:42:03.610" style="s2">some responsibilities associated with</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.350" end="00:42:05.380" style="s2">that that teaches them how to be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.610" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">healthy person an effective person in</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.380" end="00:42:09.430" style="s2">the world cuz that&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">case in the world right do I have a we</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.430" end="00:42:12.760" style="s2">start talking about everyone should have</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">universal healthcare as a right awesome</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.760" end="00:42:16.540" style="s2">who pays for it who pays the doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:18.820" style="s2">the nurses and the hospitals and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.540" end="00:42:21.610" style="s2">diagnostics and builds the MRI machines</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.820" end="00:42:24.580" style="s2">now let&#39;s start really well the rich</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.610" end="00:42:25.960" style="s2">wait okay let&#39;s just run all of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.580" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">channels of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.960" end="00:42:31.570" style="s2">so whose money is taken by force backed</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:34.150" style="s2">up by guns right which is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.570" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">what law is is a monopoly of violence</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.150" end="00:42:38.380" style="s2">and how does that make sense and what</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:40.119" style="s2">types of incentives does that create an</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.380" end="00:42:41.619" style="s2">anti incentives and just you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.119" end="00:42:42.790" style="s2">really think through the whole rights</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.619" end="00:42:44.740" style="s2">and responsibilities thing it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.790" end="00:42:47.530" style="s2">the reason democracies fail faster than</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:49.150" style="s2">monarchies it generally is and faster</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.530" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">than Republic&#39;s is people will vote</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.150" end="00:42:52.510" style="s2">themselves rights that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">willing to take the responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.510" end="00:42:56.820" style="s2">implement and so then basically everyone</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:43:02.050" style="s2">is a child right in their consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.820" end="00:43:04.180" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t work similarly if</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.050" end="00:43:05.800" style="s2">people are responsible for something and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.180" end="00:43:07.570" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the attendant rights</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.800" end="00:43:11.470" style="s2">associated that&#39;s some kind of servitude</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.570" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">or slavery right so it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.470" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">those things be balanced and so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:21.160" style="s2">right side is if I want to operate a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">larger scale and have people be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.160" end="00:43:25.630" style="s2">interested in what I have to say there I</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:27.970" style="s2">kind of have to earn that right if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.630" end="00:43:30.580" style="s2">want to have like having people listen</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.970" end="00:43:31.810" style="s2">to what I have to say is a like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.580" end="00:43:33.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a privilege that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.810" end="00:43:34.869" style="s2">with that but I did I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.550" end="00:43:37.390" style="s2">right to it without the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.869" end="00:43:39.369" style="s2">that I had to take first to offer things</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.390" end="00:43:41.740" style="s2">of value so one of the things I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.369" end="00:43:43.510" style="s2">say about scale is you earn it you earn</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.740" end="00:43:44.589" style="s2">operating at scale if that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.510" end="00:43:47.710" style="s2">calling and it shouldn&#39;t be most</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.589" end="00:43:53.500" style="s2">people&#39;s by doing a good job at smaller</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.710" end="00:43:55.060" style="s2">skills great sensible makes sense I</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.500" end="00:43:58.330" style="s2">think that&#39;s a thing it&#39;s funny it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.060" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">like um we you know we we all the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.330" end="00:44:05.230" style="s2">start thinking that maybe we have an</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:07.630" style="s2">idea for large solutions at scale and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.230" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">know for myself it&#39;s like the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.630" end="00:44:10.990" style="s2">taking me years to actually learn to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:13.510" style="s2">slow down enough to even ask what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.990" end="00:44:17.410" style="s2">when I think I have an idea for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.510" end="00:44:19.000" style="s2">solution scale and you know like the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.410" end="00:44:21.250" style="s2">process of actually examining the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.000" end="00:44:24.430" style="s2">underlying assumptions and and the and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.250" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">the just huge amount of no data like no</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.430" end="00:44:31.570" style="s2">proof no data pieces of kind of if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">will imagination without a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.570" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">to okay I&#39;ve imagined something now I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:39.430" style="s2">need to go check out and and find out if</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.839" end="00:44:39.720" style="s2">that works now if we&#39;re an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.430" end="00:44:41.790" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.720" end="00:44:44.609" style="s2">say hey I imagine having the the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.790" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">badass music app ever I&#39;m not gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.609" end="00:44:47.339" style="s2">a I&#39;m not gonna walk up to an investor</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:49.050" style="s2">and say hey give me a hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.339" end="00:44:51.960" style="s2">dollars I&#39;m the most badass music a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.050" end="00:44:54.030" style="s2">pepper like I say great here&#39;s $1,000 go</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.960" end="00:44:56.220" style="s2">do something or here&#39;s $100,000 go do</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.030" end="00:44:58.589" style="s2">something show to me that you can in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.220" end="00:45:01.950" style="s2">very small level making something badass</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.589" end="00:45:04.109" style="s2">a bow I think when we start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.950" end="00:45:07.140" style="s2">you know wanting to alter the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.109" end="00:45:08.819" style="s2">systems in which the world operates we</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.140" end="00:45:10.619" style="s2">have that kind of naivete like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.819" end="00:45:12.810" style="s2">gonna likes if somebody just give me the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.619" end="00:45:14.069" style="s2">authority to say how it&#39;s gonna be mad I</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.810" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">could just fix all of this stuff really</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.069" end="00:45:19.319" style="s2">really quick and I mean that that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.660" style="s2">think that&#39;s we would agree that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.319" end="00:45:23.460" style="s2">that&#39;s that naivete that ends up making</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.660" end="00:45:25.619" style="s2">decisions that fuck up shit worse than</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.460" end="00:45:29.250" style="s2">it was fucked up before we made those</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.619" end="00:45:31.859" style="s2">decisions and yet there needs to be some</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.250" end="00:45:34.109" style="s2">kind of lattice worth of framework for</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.859" end="00:45:37.380" style="s2">us to begin to understand how to try out</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.109" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">ideas you know and and and not the old</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.380" end="00:45:42.780" style="s2">idea is not the you know the past 200</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:44.609" style="s2">years of retreaded ideas over and over</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.780" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">again but and there has to be a way for</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.609" end="00:45:50.970" style="s2">us to begin to think new thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:52.710" style="s2">try new things you know where do we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.970" end="00:45:55.770" style="s2">the space to do that and how do we carve</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.710" end="00:45:59.700" style="s2">that out of what is know as I think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.770" end="00:46:01.710" style="s2">agree as a crumbling society how do we</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.700" end="00:46:03.030" style="s2">not just hold on to the stones of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.710" end="00:46:04.230" style="s2">things around us and try to keep them</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.030" end="00:46:06.750" style="s2">from falling down and still have enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.230" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">space to to try to stand up these things</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.750" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">in the world you&#39;re saying brings up for</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:21.750" style="s2">me this dialectic between there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:23.940" style="s2">of hubris or a audacity people will use</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.130" end="00:46:35.250" style="s2">with the kind of humility of</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.660" end="00:46:38.910" style="s2">understanding why it&#39;s never been done</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:41.819" style="s2">and what attempts have failed by people</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.910" end="00:46:45.329" style="s2">that were competent and smart and what</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.819" end="00:46:47.609" style="s2">things have you know yeah there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.329" end="00:46:50.040" style="s2">important it it&#39;s kind of like when we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.609" end="00:46:51.750" style="s2">were saying if I&#39;ve got two scientists</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.040" end="00:46:53.170" style="s2">who spent 30 years studying a topic and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.750" end="00:46:55.180" style="s2">they disagree how the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.170" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">I possibly even imagined that I could</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.180" end="00:46:58.809" style="s2">come to have a view on it when I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.280" style="s2">gonna study all they studied well</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.809" end="00:47:01.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain hubris in that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.280" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">there&#39;s also the humility of I know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.720" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they know but maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.980" style="s2">can come to understand how they</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:10.510" style="s2">constructed the ideas well enough that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.980" end="00:47:12.430" style="s2">by being able to take both of their</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.510" end="00:47:13.720" style="s2">positions maybe more flexibly than they</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.430" end="00:47:16.540" style="s2">do because maybe they hold their own</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.720" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">position more I can gain some insight so</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.540" end="00:47:21.670" style="s2">there&#39;s there is a kind of faith in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:23.349" style="s2">possibility right that is almost like</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.670" end="00:47:26.020" style="s2">hubris it&#39;s a faith and a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.349" end="00:47:29.609" style="s2">that I could do that same as like build</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.020" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">a new thing but if I haven&#39;t looked at</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.609" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">so what are what are all the attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:35.650" style="s2">try and do that that failed or that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">ended up going another way because they</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.650" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">res that was actually the wrong thing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:43.150" style="s2">do then it&#39;s just almost guaranteed that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:46.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll just fail and waste the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.150" end="00:47:48.369" style="s2">the other people who engage given a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.630" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">cross-section of human beings in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.369" end="00:47:54.700" style="s2">different places and locations obviously</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">with at least enough for resources to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.700" end="00:48:00.579" style="s2">think about the issue who would like to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:03.609" style="s2">improve things on both local levels and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.579" end="00:48:06.730" style="s2">global levels in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.609" end="00:48:10.599" style="s2">healthy healthy environment healthy food</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.730" end="00:48:13.089" style="s2">healthy lifestyle with a relative amount</p>

<p begin="00:48:16.839" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">in the middle of that sandwich not at</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.150" end="00:48:23.650" style="s2">the top is is there is there something</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:26.349" style="s2">for us to do I mean we obviously have</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.650" end="00:48:28.569" style="s2">some kind of desire and passion to to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.349" end="00:48:30.750" style="s2">you know make a difference or evolve</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.569" end="00:48:34.540" style="s2">things or set things on a better path</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.750" end="00:48:35.980" style="s2">you know it is I guess is like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.540" end="00:48:38.020" style="s2">there is no framework but if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.980" end="00:48:39.940" style="s2">framework you know like what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.020" end="00:48:41.530" style="s2">that has us have the capacity to do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.940" end="00:48:44.950" style="s2">or is it just allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.530" end="00:48:46.599" style="s2">self-organizing universe to - to do its</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.950" end="00:48:47.799" style="s2">do its work and we actually just have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.599" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">trust that what we&#39;re doing is the right</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.799" end="00:48:52.359" style="s2">thing to do or that we are effort itself</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.770" style="s2">adds up to something I mean do you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.359" end="00:48:59.589" style="s2">where I&#39;m kind of stuck between a rock</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.770" end="00:49:01.390" style="s2">and a hard place of this Daniel it</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.589" end="00:49:03.369" style="s2">relates to the scale question we asked</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.390" end="00:49:06.970" style="s2">earlier you&#39;re asking a question at</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.369" end="00:49:08.920" style="s2">maximum scale great I&#39;ll reframe them</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.970" end="00:49:09.940" style="s2">I&#39;ll just say that hyperlocal scales for</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.920" end="00:49:11.740" style="s2">right now because I can certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.940" end="00:49:13.420" style="s2">imagine that better than I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.740" end="00:49:14.710" style="s2">I mean even at the scale of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.420" end="00:49:17.710" style="s2">cross-section of who we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.710" end="00:49:19.600" style="s2">right that&#39;s a very huge week it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.710" end="00:49:21.880" style="s2">very diverse we that have very different</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.600" end="00:49:25.570" style="s2">interests and proclivities and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.880" end="00:49:27.700" style="s2">capacities and access so for me to</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.570" end="00:49:29.470" style="s2">answer that generalize the level it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.700" end="00:49:31.540" style="s2">be a very generalized answer which I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.470" end="00:49:35.140" style="s2">do I&#39;ll do it but it&#39;ll be almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.540" end="00:49:36.940" style="s2">platitude like okay we&#39;ll take that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.140" end="00:49:39.220" style="s2">then we&#39;ll reframe it afterwards after</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.940" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">we see what we see how that that fits</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.220" end="00:49:48.910" style="s2">great thank you because it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:51.730" style="s2">to note if I was talking with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.910" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">American retail Association what can we</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.730" end="00:49:55.420" style="s2">do and it&#39;s the heads of the large</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:57.130" style="s2">retail businesses we could really talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.420" end="00:49:58.750" style="s2">through with the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.130" end="00:50:00.220" style="s2">capable of doing and what their mandates</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.750" end="00:50:01.630" style="s2">the shareholders are whatever what could</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.220" end="00:50:03.220" style="s2">they actually do we could start to map</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.630" end="00:50:04.690" style="s2">out the opportunity space and problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.220" end="00:50:06.070" style="s2">space if we were talking to the Joint</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.690" end="00:50:08.050" style="s2">Chiefs of Staff or the National Security</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.070" end="00:50:11.260" style="s2">Council or a local group of farmers we</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.050" end="00:50:12.910" style="s2">could answer that right or or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.260" end="00:50:16.990" style="s2">association of accountants or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.910" end="00:50:19.180" style="s2">it is right but when it&#39;s this broad</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.990" end="00:50:21.130" style="s2">people don&#39;t have a shared sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.180" end="00:50:23.710" style="s2">the desirable world is anything more</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.130" end="00:50:25.750" style="s2">than just like a feeling right is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.710" end="00:50:27.820" style="s2">more libertarian or is it more socialist</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.750" end="00:50:29.860" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re more different than most</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.820" end="00:50:31.480" style="s2">people acknowledge and there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.860" end="00:50:33.190" style="s2">projects of what we&#39;re doing towards it</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.480" end="00:50:34.630" style="s2">is it more kind of permaculture a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.190" end="00:50:36.190" style="s2">low-tech or super high-tech</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.630" end="00:50:38.740" style="s2">transhumanist upload my brain to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.190" end="00:50:42.070" style="s2">cloud like even what is desirable is</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.740" end="00:50:43.270" style="s2">thought very very differently and our</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.070" end="00:50:44.320" style="s2">levels of understanding of how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.270" end="00:50:48.910" style="s2">advance towards that plus our</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.320" end="00:50:51.640" style="s2">capabilities so I&#39;m just noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.910" end="00:50:54.250" style="s2">there there&#39;s kind of baked in frames</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.640" end="00:50:57.100" style="s2">and the way we ask those questions that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.250" end="00:50:58.810" style="s2">are worth exploring yeah and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.100" end="00:51:01.000" style="s2">I&#39;m like you know I just wanted to be in</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.810" end="00:51:06.040" style="s2">the kind of presence to the inquiry kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.000" end="00:51:07.270" style="s2">of moment here and you know you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.040" end="00:51:08.350" style="s2">you talk about you know and I know you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.270" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">don&#39;t like to wear an impact you talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.350" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">about you know impact work or all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:16.450" style="s2">these things that we use to describe</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.220" style="s2">like the things that we&#39;re doing but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.450" end="00:51:19.240" style="s2">think in in general I&#39;m just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.220" end="00:51:20.410" style="s2">confronted with the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.240" end="00:51:23.050" style="s2">actually not very well questioned</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.410" end="00:51:25.030" style="s2">we&#39;d actually don&#39;t we don&#39;t say what we</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.050" end="00:51:28.180" style="s2">mean by them we don&#39;t or at least we</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.030" end="00:51:30.370" style="s2">don&#39;t have a what have a reliable</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.180" end="00:51:32.950" style="s2">definition that could be could be shared</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.370" end="00:51:34.980" style="s2">amongst a lot of people but we speak to</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.950" end="00:51:42.580" style="s2">a spectrum as if there are real things</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.980" end="00:51:45.700" style="s2">yeah and to an evangelical protesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.580" end="00:51:50.890" style="s2">abortion clinics is doing impact work</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.700" end="00:51:52.780" style="s2">and to say certain democratically</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.890" end="00:51:54.550" style="s2">oriented people supporting Planned</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.780" end="00:51:56.890" style="s2">Parenthood fundraising is impact work</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.550" end="00:51:59.950" style="s2">and they&#39;re out there two pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.890" end="00:52:02.010" style="s2">impact work equally earnestly motivated</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.950" end="00:52:05.190" style="s2">a direct war with each other right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.010" end="00:52:07.240" style="s2">the same is true about like</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.190" end="00:52:08.830" style="s2">environmentalism and climate change work</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.240" end="00:52:14.320" style="s2">versus oil worker rights for an oil</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.830" end="00:52:16.600" style="s2">Union right and so yeah it&#39;s just worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.320" end="00:52:23.460" style="s2">thinking more precisely about some of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.600" end="00:52:26.500" style="s2">these things we&#39;re gonna say no please</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.460" end="00:52:29.110" style="s2">to take it to even an even smaller scale</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.500" end="00:52:31.780" style="s2">all right okay we&#39;ve gone to the cross</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.110" end="00:52:34.690" style="s2">section to maybe some of these regional</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.780" end="00:52:37.900" style="s2">spaces and now very niche environments</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.690" end="00:52:39.610" style="s2">but take it to even a smaller scale I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.900" end="00:52:43.180" style="s2">curious what are some questions that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.610" end="00:52:45.910" style="s2">ask yourself before you decide that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.180" end="00:52:48.970" style="s2">care enough about something to put some</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.910" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">effort into knowing about it growing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.970" end="00:52:55.090" style="s2">putting your focus to it so that when</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:57.970" style="s2">people that are listening to this have</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.090" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">their own experience and their own self</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.970" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">inquiry decide if they they care enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:05.830" style="s2">about something like what are those</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:08.260" style="s2">questions to be asking ourselves at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.830" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">time to see if we should be putting our</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.260" end="00:53:15.160" style="s2">effort or our attention or our study or</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:16.330" style="s2">our intelligence or our heart with what</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.160" end="00:53:19.110" style="s2">all the things that we can care about</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.330" end="00:53:22.600" style="s2">because we can care about all of it in</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.110" end="00:53:24.000" style="s2">in very equal ways but to get down to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.600" end="00:53:26.410" style="s2">where we&#39;re not just sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.000" end="00:53:29.380" style="s2">taking in all the information but</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.410" end="00:53:31.120" style="s2">actually putting out something what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.380" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">what are some good questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.120" end="00:53:35.830" style="s2">could be asking ourselves maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:40.570" style="s2">how are you asking yourself when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.830" end="00:53:45.670" style="s2">choose to do something yeah it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.570" end="00:53:48.340" style="s2">question it&#39;s interesting though though</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.670" end="00:53:53.170" style="s2">how that we effects it how different it</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.340" end="00:53:54.550" style="s2">is when I if I&#39;m at phases in my life</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.170" end="00:53:56.110" style="s2">where I haven&#39;t had any projects I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.550" end="00:53:59.560" style="s2">running and I&#39;m just in an interstitial</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.110" end="00:54:01.480" style="s2">place and I&#39;m kind of researching so</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.560" end="00:54:03.790" style="s2">it&#39;s just with my own bandwidth right</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.480" end="00:54:05.260" style="s2">versus initiating a project and now</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.790" end="00:54:07.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a team so I have way more</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.260" end="00:54:10.450" style="s2">bandwidth but I also have way more</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.780" end="00:54:12.130" style="s2">output it is expected to be able to keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.450" end="00:54:14.619" style="s2">paying that team right whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.130" end="00:54:17.410" style="s2">non-profit or for-profit and to be able</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.619" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">to grow the capacity well all of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.410" end="00:54:20.619" style="s2">sudden I&#39;m actually getting more</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:24.369" style="s2">constrained on what we focus on even</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.619" end="00:54:28.330" style="s2">though there&#39;s more more total capacity</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.369" end="00:54:31.360" style="s2">right and this is why they experience it</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.330" end="00:54:33.430" style="s2">actually running a business or running a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.360" end="00:54:35.590" style="s2">non-profit where you&#39;re responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.430" end="00:54:39.630" style="s2">the finance is a can be a very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.590" end="00:54:43.859" style="s2">learning experience is you start to ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.630" end="00:54:47.350" style="s2">okay this seems super fascinating but</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.859" end="00:54:50.380" style="s2">there are a total of 75,000 hours worth</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.350" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">of activity per day we&#39;d like to do and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.380" end="00:54:55.060" style="s2">we can&#39;t do all of it so what things do</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:56.369" style="s2">I do factoring the opportunity costs of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.060" end="00:54:58.930" style="s2">the other things I&#39;m not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.369" end="00:55:00.340" style="s2">well I&#39;d like to be able to do more</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.930" end="00:55:03.310" style="s2">total stuff than we actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.340" end="00:55:05.140" style="s2">bandwidth to do so if I just use all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.310" end="00:55:06.520" style="s2">our bandwidth doing immediate work we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.140" end="00:55:08.560" style="s2">won&#39;t grow our bandwidth we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.520" end="00:55:09.940" style="s2">using it so I have to think about how do</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.560" end="00:55:12.250" style="s2">I do the things that are immediately</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.940" end="00:55:13.390" style="s2">needed and things how do we use our</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.250" end="00:55:14.590" style="s2">bandwidth in ways that grow our</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.390" end="00:55:16.180" style="s2">bandwidth right that show the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.590" end="00:55:18.070" style="s2">effectiveness of what we&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.180" end="00:55:20.619" style="s2">ways that can grow the team and grow the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.070" end="00:55:23.830" style="s2">the financing the legibility the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.619" end="00:55:25.869" style="s2">whatever so you think about is this a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.830" end="00:55:27.310" style="s2">project we can actually figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.869" end="00:55:29.290" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna start researching is this a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.310" end="00:55:31.270" style="s2">project we can actually figure out well</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.290" end="00:55:33.730" style="s2">enough to offer differential novel</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.270" end="00:55:37.300" style="s2">insights do we have the team capability</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.730" end="00:55:38.980" style="s2">to do that and then is this something</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.300" end="00:55:40.990" style="s2">that if we had those insights we could</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.980" end="00:55:42.490" style="s2">act on do we have the channels to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.990" end="00:55:44.320" style="s2">able to actuate the things that would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.490" end="00:55:45.619" style="s2">needed or do we just have those insights</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.320" end="00:55:50.059" style="s2">we&#39;re just sitting on them</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.619" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">and then the opportunity cost of what</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.059" end="00:55:54.529" style="s2">other things am I not doing to do this</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:57.589" style="s2">thing right so those are types of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.529" end="00:55:59.749" style="s2">frameworks that are very basic but they</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.589" end="00:56:02.839" style="s2">can be valuable to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.749" end="00:56:05.450" style="s2">finiteness of time well yeah if your</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.839" end="00:56:09.980" style="s2">classic two by two matrix even more</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.450" end="00:56:13.910" style="s2">basic let&#39;s just say yeah make it even</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.980" end="00:56:19.369" style="s2">more basic let&#39;s say you&#39;re one with two</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.910" end="00:56:22.730" style="s2">hands and a life choice to make all</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.369" end="00:56:25.309" style="s2">right very basic and a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.730" end="00:56:28.190" style="s2">that one person in that one room right</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.309" end="00:56:31.279" style="s2">now with just two hands and that one</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.190" end="00:56:33.499" style="s2">life choice to make right now and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.279" end="00:56:35.660" style="s2">curious what questions would they be</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.499" end="00:56:38.869" style="s2">asking themselves about what&#39;s in each</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.660" end="00:56:41.299" style="s2">hand to help them decide on what that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.869" end="00:56:43.069" style="s2">one choice it&#39;s cuz and maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.299" end="00:56:45.289" style="s2">choice for them is like that one thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.069" end="00:56:47.420" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been kind of putting off</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.289" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">their entire life and this quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.420" end="00:56:53.359" style="s2">moment is that moment for them to</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:55.069" style="s2">actually make that choice so now the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.359" end="00:56:57.529" style="s2">you frame that as a rephrasing of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.069" end="00:56:59.809" style="s2">Michael asked because that one person is</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.529" end="00:57:01.369" style="s2">now the one person avatar of the we</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.809" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">which is to everybody because when</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.369" end="00:57:06.499" style="s2">people are all different again so I will</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:11.869" style="s2">now go to the very generalized answer I</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.499" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">said today would and I just want to I</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.869" end="00:57:15.079" style="s2">just want to point like we&#39;re all very</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:17.150" style="s2">smart</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.079" end="00:57:19.069" style="s2">you know people we&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.150" end="00:57:22.279" style="s2">study in letting you just like this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.069" end="00:57:29.059" style="s2">hard stuff you you you you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.279" end="00:57:30.140" style="s2">things get very undistinguished is again</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.059" end="00:57:32.359" style="s2">the same question but actually be</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.140" end="00:57:34.819" style="s2">examined it&#39;s not very distinct it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.359" end="00:57:36.920" style="s2">very generalized so let&#39;s let&#39;s hear the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.819" end="00:57:38.779" style="s2">generalize answers even though it may</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.920" end="00:57:40.670" style="s2">not be a very effective answer I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.779" end="00:57:46.489" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s worth now at least hearing and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.670" end="00:57:49.430" style="s2">exploring that what we&#39;re asking is how</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.489" end="00:57:50.779" style="s2">do humans live a meaningful life right</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.430" end="00:57:54.200" style="s2">like that&#39;s the question you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.779" end="00:57:55.999" style="s2">is how do different humans who want</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.200" end="00:57:58.040" style="s2">their life to contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.999" end="00:58:01.790" style="s2">well-being of the whole in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.040" end="00:58:05.660" style="s2">have their life actually be well engaged</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.790" end="00:58:08.450" style="s2">and well used and that is the core of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.660" end="00:58:10.580" style="s2">all religious and spiritual and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.450" end="00:58:12.530" style="s2">and philosophical kinds of inquiries</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.580" end="00:58:13.670" style="s2">right so that&#39;s why I said what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.530" end="00:58:15.080" style="s2">gonna answer is gonna end up being</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.670" end="00:58:18.530" style="s2">pretty general because it&#39;s a big fuckin</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.080" end="00:58:21.850" style="s2">question and it&#39;s a so a few things I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.530" end="00:58:25.100" style="s2">can say the reason I was pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.850" end="00:58:26.450" style="s2">that wait are we trying to end all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.100" end="00:58:29.090" style="s2">abortion clinics or make abortions</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.450" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">available to everybody is that how to</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.090" end="00:58:33.050" style="s2">have my life be able to create impact</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:35.000" style="s2">impact towards what what is my</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.050" end="00:58:38.600" style="s2">fundamental ethical framework of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.000" end="00:58:41.470" style="s2">good is right how do I make sense if not</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.600" end="00:58:44.300" style="s2">just what I think is but what ought and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.470" end="00:58:45.950" style="s2">so to inform what I&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.300" end="00:58:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s the science II side the sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.950" end="00:58:51.290" style="s2">making side of what is the forecasting</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.800" end="00:58:53.840" style="s2">side of what will be the effect of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.290" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">specific action and the ethical side of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.840" end="00:58:58.310" style="s2">what is a good life what is a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:59:01.070" style="s2">world what what am i wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.310" end="00:59:03.770" style="s2">contribute to realizing that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.070" end="00:59:05.869" style="s2">things that people do actually elicit</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.770" end="00:59:09.530" style="s2">counter responses and drive Wars rather</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.869" end="00:59:11.420" style="s2">than actually advance anything and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.530" end="00:59:13.070" style="s2">they drive arms races and escalating</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.420" end="00:59:16.359" style="s2">wars and they drive second and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.070" end="00:59:21.320" style="s2">third-order negative effects right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.359" end="00:59:22.670" style="s2">so we build a cool little communication</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.320" end="00:59:23.630" style="s2">app so we can just send these tweets to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.670" end="00:59:25.160" style="s2">each other because that seems really</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.630" end="00:59:27.410" style="s2">like it&#39;s kind of cool the short thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.160" end="00:59:28.790" style="s2">and then all of a sudden World War 3 is</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.410" end="00:59:30.590" style="s2">being waged over it because the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.790" end="00:59:32.570" style="s2">president is using it news like oh fuck</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.590" end="00:59:34.580" style="s2">with it those were big unintended</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.570" end="00:59:38.480" style="s2">consequences of the things that we were</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.580" end="00:59:40.550" style="s2">doing so so how do we make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:42.560" style="s2">world make sense of what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.550" end="00:59:45.260" style="s2">good and write and think through the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.560" end="00:59:46.760" style="s2">effects of our actions right and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.260" end="00:59:47.960" style="s2">how do we actually act on those things</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.760" end="00:59:50.530" style="s2">in a prioritized way and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.960" end="00:59:53.500" style="s2">increase our capacity to keep doing so</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.530" end="00:59:56.090" style="s2">those are I think some reframes of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.500" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">underneath the question you&#39;re asking if</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.090" end="01:00:00.290" style="s2">I was trying to be more precise and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:04.940" style="s2">the main thing I would say is like</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.290" end="01:00:07.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a development of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.940" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">humans there&#39;s the engagement of us but</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.100" end="01:00:10.800" style="s2">also the development of us so that our</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:15.630" style="s2">engagement keeps being better guided and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.800" end="01:00:17.790" style="s2">effective right and this is the how do I</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.630" end="01:00:20.250" style="s2">know more about what&#39;s going on how do I</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.790" end="01:00:21.960" style="s2">do a better job at prioritizing how do I</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.250" end="01:00:24.870" style="s2">do a better job of communicating and</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.960" end="01:00:30.600" style="s2">compelling in effective ways all those</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.870" end="01:00:33.360" style="s2">things and how do I make sure that what</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.600" end="01:00:35.580" style="s2">I&#39;m doing is actually what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.360" end="01:00:40.140" style="s2">meaningful to me and my time isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.580" end="01:00:43.260" style="s2">hijacked by habit addiction fear lack of</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.140" end="01:00:45.360" style="s2">courage distraction and other things</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.260" end="01:00:46.890" style="s2">right that&#39;s one of the that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.360" end="01:00:49.470" style="s2">the biggest ones is what are the things</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.890" end="01:00:50.940" style="s2">that are hijacking your attention that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.470" end="01:00:52.770" style="s2">on your deathbed will not be some of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.940" end="01:00:54.150" style="s2">your highlights right that won&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.770" end="01:00:56.130" style="s2">like those are the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.150" end="01:00:58.110" style="s2">really proud of or feel really grateful</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.130" end="01:01:00.710" style="s2">about and how can you become</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.110" end="01:01:04.070" style="s2">progressively less hijacked by those</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.710" end="01:01:07.410" style="s2">also humans have complex motivation</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.070" end="01:01:08.820" style="s2">right I want to make these amazing</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.410" end="01:01:11.220" style="s2">things happen in the world why well</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.820" end="01:01:14.070" style="s2">because I want to save all these kids</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.220" end="01:01:19.770" style="s2">over here why well because I care about</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.070" end="01:01:21.510" style="s2">those kids that&#39;s true but I also want</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.770" end="01:01:25.530" style="s2">the credit of being the guy who did that</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.510" end="01:01:27.450" style="s2">because of unresolved kind of wounded</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.530" end="01:01:30.050" style="s2">ego insecurities stuff where I want that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.450" end="01:01:33.120" style="s2">particular credit and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.050" end="01:01:34.380" style="s2">chicks will actually dig it and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.120" end="01:01:36.330" style="s2">I&#39;ll make some money in the process</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.380" end="01:01:37.710" style="s2">and it will address the fact that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.330" end="01:01:39.300" style="s2">never got approval for my parents that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.710" end="01:01:41.640" style="s2">I&#39;m projecting on whatever right like</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.300" end="01:01:43.310" style="s2">motive this complex so typically</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.640" end="01:01:46.740" style="s2">whenever someone is doing something</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:48.690" style="s2">there&#39;s like 10 or 15 different reasons</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.740" end="01:01:50.670" style="s2">they&#39;re actually doing in they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.690" end="01:01:52.140" style="s2">usually only aware of half of them half</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.670" end="01:01:53.880" style="s2">of them are subconscious even to them</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.140" end="01:01:55.770" style="s2">and of the ones they&#39;re aware of they</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.880" end="01:01:56.940" style="s2">usually only admit one or two in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.770" end="01:02:00.420" style="s2">executive summary of the project</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.940" end="01:02:01.650" style="s2">statement and so part of it also in</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.420" end="01:02:03.390" style="s2">terms of how to be more effective is to</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.650" end="01:02:08.580" style="s2">become more reflective into your own</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.390" end="01:02:12.780" style="s2">motives and how to heal the things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.580" end="01:02:14.580" style="s2">are actually siphoning energy away right</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.780" end="01:02:15.720" style="s2">as you grow and heal some of the motives</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.580" end="01:02:17.220" style="s2">will become deeper and some will become</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.720" end="01:02:19.260" style="s2">less so you want to know which are the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.220" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">ones that are coming from the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.260" end="01:02:22.200" style="s2">truth of who I am and which are the ones</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:24.130" style="s2">that are coming from distraction trauma</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.200" end="01:02:25.840" style="s2">and security and other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.130" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s personal development to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.840" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">able to have rather than mixed motives</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:31.840" style="s2">that are doing like two masters issues</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:38.110" style="s2">where it is more like a laser all</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.840" end="01:02:40.300" style="s2">coherent so I think what I just said is</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.110" end="01:02:42.700" style="s2">people need if they want to become more</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.300" end="01:02:45.940" style="s2">effective they need to study the topics</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.700" end="01:02:47.110" style="s2">they want to influence more like if</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.940" end="01:02:49.390" style="s2">you&#39;re really wanting to help with food</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.110" end="01:02:51.340" style="s2">security stuff you better study soil and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.390" end="01:02:53.770" style="s2">agriculture and different types of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.340" end="01:02:55.110" style="s2">agricultural systems and why it went the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.770" end="01:02:57.100" style="s2">way that it went what are the financial</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.110" end="01:02:58.810" style="s2">challenges whatever so that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.100" end="01:02:59.830" style="s2">understand what is the problem space</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.810" end="01:03:02.200" style="s2">well enough to come up with good</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.830" end="01:03:07.960" style="s2">solutions so you need to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.200" end="01:03:10.360" style="s2">actually study the space you need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.960" end="01:03:11.740" style="s2">look at what things you can implement</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.360" end="01:03:14.200" style="s2">because there&#39;s a bunch of stuff you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.740" end="01:03:15.790" style="s2">only learn by doing and as you start to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.200" end="01:03:17.470" style="s2">do it you&#39;ll learn in the process a</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.790" end="01:03:19.930" style="s2">tremendous amount of stuff so what can i</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.470" end="01:03:22.660" style="s2">implement with my current capacities so</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.930" end="01:03:24.040" style="s2">that as I&#39;m studying more one I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.660" end="01:03:27.750" style="s2">impact now and I&#39;m learning in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.040" end="01:03:30.100" style="s2">tangible grounded way and how can I both</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.750" end="01:03:31.780" style="s2">continuously be reminded of what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.100" end="01:03:34.030" style="s2">meaningful to me so that I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.780" end="01:03:37.060" style="s2">distracted and hijacked it hijacked and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.030" end="01:03:38.860" style="s2">how can I be engaged in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.060" end="01:03:45.940" style="s2">personal development process that makes</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.860" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">my motivation itself clearer and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.940" end="01:03:49.780" style="s2">those are the questions I would ask</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:54.760" style="s2">underneath it would give rise to the how</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.780" end="01:03:57.730" style="s2">can we do good things and my main answer</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.760" end="01:03:59.830" style="s2">would be the easiest way to succeed at</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.730" end="01:04:02.310" style="s2">that is to interact with people who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.830" end="01:04:04.870" style="s2">succeeding at that better more often</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.310" end="01:04:06.820" style="s2">you&#39;ll be the average of the five people</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.870" end="01:04:08.950" style="s2">you spend the most time around all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.820" end="01:04:11.380" style="s2">proximity is destiny all those types of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.950" end="01:04:13.240" style="s2">statements we are social primates more</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.380" end="01:04:14.530" style="s2">than we like to admit and that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.240" end="01:04:17.290" style="s2">spend our time on Facebook and Instagram</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.530" end="01:04:19.090" style="s2">just actually scrolling at pictures of</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.290" end="01:04:21.000" style="s2">other primates right like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.090" end="01:04:23.440" style="s2">thing that really fucking captures us is</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.000" end="01:04:25.300" style="s2">and it&#39;s so interesting because what</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.440" end="01:04:27.190" style="s2">we&#39;re it&#39;s like junk food where you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.300" end="01:04:29.110" style="s2">extract the salt fat and sugar and</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.190" end="01:04:30.910" style="s2">remove all the nutrients so you maximize</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.110" end="01:04:32.410" style="s2">the hyper normal stimuli without any of</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.910" end="01:04:35.380" style="s2">the real thing and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.410" end="01:04:37.809" style="s2">social media thing is is it it maximizes</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.380" end="01:04:39.249" style="s2">the likes and pictures and interaction</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.809" end="01:04:42.099" style="s2">in total number of people while removing</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.249" end="01:04:45.309" style="s2">almost all actual kinds of real contact</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.099" end="01:04:48.670" style="s2">and vulnerability that are scary but it</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.309" end="01:04:50.589" style="s2">shows the longing for social contact and</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.670" end="01:04:54.489" style="s2">then also the way we&#39;re influenced by</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.589" end="01:04:56.739" style="s2">what we&#39;re around so if people want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.489" end="01:05:00.130" style="s2">actually be doing more interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.739" end="01:05:01.569" style="s2">things so in each of those areas how do</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.130" end="01:05:05.019" style="s2">I get how do I do the personal</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.569" end="01:05:07.749" style="s2">development to have ego and security</p>

<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:29.499" style="s2">it is so that I&#39;m actively engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.089" end="01:05:33.640" style="s2">learning things right that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.499" end="01:05:35.739" style="s2">meaningful if I want to get better at</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.640" end="01:05:37.089" style="s2">actualizing the things I know who are</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.739" end="01:05:38.410" style="s2">the people that are the most fuckin</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.089" end="01:05:40.749" style="s2">productive that I know where I really</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.410" end="01:05:42.759" style="s2">respect that and spend time figure out</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.749" end="01:05:45.910" style="s2">how to be useful to them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.759" end="01:05:48.779" style="s2">busy right so figure out how to free</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.910" end="01:05:53.140" style="s2">more of their time than I&#39;m asking for</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.779" end="01:05:54.729" style="s2">and because I want to learn how they</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.140" end="01:05:57.309" style="s2">think about the world that makes them so</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.729" end="01:05:59.410" style="s2">productive so I would say the thing I</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.309" end="01:06:02.140" style="s2">can offer that is most useful to all</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.410" end="01:06:03.549" style="s2">this is actually the social hack of</p>

<p begin="01:06:03.549" end="01:06:11.170" style="s2">iron discipline do it through actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:12.759" style="s2">intentionally doping what you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.170" end="01:06:18.699" style="s2">in through your senses regularly which</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.759" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">is mostly who I&#39;m a little in a space</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.699" end="01:06:24.279" style="s2">where I don&#39;t want to know the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:29.499" style="s2">this next question so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.279" end="01:06:33.549" style="s2">gonna go for it but I am curious what</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.499" end="01:06:35.469" style="s2">have you been just kind of OCD wanting</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.549" end="01:06:37.239" style="s2">to learn about what&#39;s that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.469" end="01:06:40.689" style="s2">keeping you up at night like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.239" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">thing for you and the real real what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.689" end="01:06:47.679" style="s2">the real thing that you are just hyper</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:51.500" style="s2">focused on getting as much information</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.679" end="01:06:54.830" style="s2">as possible right and what&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.500" end="01:06:59.510" style="s2">learning that just blew your mind about</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.830" end="01:07:02.600" style="s2">it so far one of the questions that has</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.510" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">been very central in my mind lately is</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.600" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">how do we how to architecture social</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">systems that do not reward sociopathy</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.050" end="01:07:26.200" style="s2">sociopathy narcissism sadism or any</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.970" end="01:07:34.130" style="s2">other basically power seeking</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.200" end="01:07:37.280" style="s2">dispositions that also are either like</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.130" end="01:07:41.930" style="s2">to or are willing to cause harm with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.280" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">application of that power underneath so</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.930" end="01:07:46.910" style="s2">many of the problems in the world is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:49.100" style="s2">that the people who are power seeking</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.910" end="01:07:50.360" style="s2">and willing to use power in ways to gain</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.100" end="01:07:51.830" style="s2">more power end up being the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.360" end="01:07:58.120" style="s2">powerful people in the world in defining</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.830" end="01:08:02.000" style="s2">the world and the people who care about</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.120" end="01:08:04.460" style="s2">the global Commons who don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.000" end="01:08:06.410" style="s2">cause harm and who want power seeking</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.460" end="01:08:08.300" style="s2">themselves usually don&#39;t get much power</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.410" end="01:08:11.060" style="s2">which means that they don&#39;t influence</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.300" end="01:08:14.510" style="s2">the the the overall dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.060" end="01:08:16.310" style="s2">space and it&#39;s clear to me that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.510" end="01:08:23.720" style="s2">definitely go extinct if that stays true</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.310" end="01:08:25.400" style="s2">and so this is you know this this is an</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.720" end="01:08:27.230" style="s2">old question this is kind of the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.400" end="01:08:29.060" style="s2">of law right the purpose of law is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.230" end="01:08:30.920" style="s2">collectively define what are the types</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.060" end="01:08:33.740" style="s2">of really predatory behaviors we agree</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.920" end="01:08:38.470" style="s2">we don&#39;t do and we will we will shut</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.740" end="01:08:41.180" style="s2">those down but of course throughout time</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.470" end="01:08:43.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like a civilization will create an</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.180" end="01:08:46.069" style="s2">effective legal system and then the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.900" end="01:08:47.839" style="s2">legal and governance system the</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.069" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">government is supposed to make laws that</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.839" end="01:08:52.549" style="s2">regulate the very predatory aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.480" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">of markets and personal advantage</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.549" end="01:08:58.850" style="s2">seeking but then that means that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:09:01.580" style="s2">main goal of those predatory markets is</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.850" end="01:09:03.799" style="s2">to get around or capture the regulator&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.580" end="01:09:04.980" style="s2">right which is what we call the watchdog</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.799" end="01:09:07.290" style="s2">issue so they</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.980" end="01:09:10.830" style="s2">have to figure out how to hide it right</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.290" end="01:09:12.660" style="s2">so seven offshore accounts that are hard</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.830" end="01:09:14.220" style="s2">to penetrate or whatever it is or they</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.660" end="01:09:17.009" style="s2">have to figure out how to pay for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.220" end="01:09:18.960" style="s2">campaign budgets and pay for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.009" end="01:09:24.140" style="s2">legislators that effect so they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.960" end="01:09:28.140" style="s2">captured the watchdog functionally and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.140" end="01:09:30.239" style="s2">so typically the people who are oriented</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.140" end="01:09:35.460" style="s2">to advance personal power are good at</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.239" end="01:09:37.680" style="s2">finding niches to do so and so then the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.460" end="01:09:40.680" style="s2">question is how do we rigorously close</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.680" end="01:09:43.589" style="s2">all those niches where those types of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.680" end="01:09:45.589" style="s2">behavior are never incented and that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.589" end="01:09:49.700" style="s2">don&#39;t end up gaining power and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.589" end="01:09:52.920" style="s2">decision-making across the space is</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.700" end="01:09:56.100" style="s2">actually the the power of choice making</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.920" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">is also bound to wisdom wisdom goodness</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.100" end="01:10:04.380" style="s2">those types of things I could talk about</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:06.989" style="s2">this a lot like what doesn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.380" end="01:10:08.280" style="s2">what could work and but you asked me</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.989" end="01:10:10.230" style="s2">what&#39;s something I&#39;m thinking about a</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.280" end="01:10:12.720" style="s2">lot and what&#39;s something that surprised</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.230" end="01:10:16.050" style="s2">me something that surprised me as I</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.720" end="01:10:23.960" style="s2">started to study this was how much the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.050" end="01:10:23.960" style="s2">world is actually run by sociopaths and</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:33.480" style="s2">say this in many cases within say this</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.290" end="01:10:35.850" style="s2">just basically means sociopath is</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.480" end="01:10:38.850" style="s2">willing to cause harm to advance their</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.850" end="01:10:40.920" style="s2">goal but the that cause harm isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.850" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">goal but there are some people for whom</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.920" end="01:10:47.810" style="s2">they have actually kind of fetishized</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:47.810" style="s2">the exercising of their power right and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.230" end="01:10:52.800" style="s2">and we&#39;ve certainly seen heaps of cases</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.030" end="01:10:54.739" style="s2">of this throughout history it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.800" end="01:11:00.150" style="s2">still true it&#39;s just generally hidden</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.739" end="01:11:03.000" style="s2">but the book the dictators handbook is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.150" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">nice kind of intro to it there&#39;s a short</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.000" end="01:11:06.090" style="s2">little cartoon that somebody made on</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:09.030" style="s2">YouTube that was really good called</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.090" end="01:11:10.710" style="s2">rules for rulers but it just explains</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.030" end="01:11:12.180" style="s2">why it&#39;s very hard to have an</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.710" end="01:11:14.460" style="s2">enlightened dictatorship long term</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.180" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much power in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.460" end="01:11:17.310" style="s2">those who are most power seeking and</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:19.050" style="s2">willing to use the most underhanded</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.310" end="01:11:22.409" style="s2">fucked-up techniques will try to</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.050" end="01:11:24.059" style="s2">sure it and to not lose the position to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.409" end="01:11:24.840" style="s2">them you have to be able to think</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.059" end="01:11:26.489" style="s2">through the things that they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.840" end="01:11:30.900" style="s2">through better and engage in some of</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.489" end="01:11:32.760" style="s2">those tactics and so how how do you not</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.900" end="01:11:34.770" style="s2">get beaten by warring cultures without</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.760" end="01:11:36.059" style="s2">becoming a warring culture right and</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.770" end="01:11:37.710" style="s2">throughout history so many of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.059" end="01:11:38.940" style="s2">peaceful cultures just got slaughtered</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.710" end="01:11:41.460" style="s2">by the warring cultures or they had to</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.940" end="01:11:45.059" style="s2">stop being peaceful cultures so like</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.460" end="01:11:47.340" style="s2">this this question and I used to think</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.059" end="01:11:50.489" style="s2">more just in terms of system disposition</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.340" end="01:11:52.889" style="s2">well it&#39;s based on the nature of what is</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.489" end="01:11:54.809" style="s2">being incentivized and what&#39;s perverse</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.889" end="01:11:57.480" style="s2">and sense of an externality so we need</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.809" end="01:11:59.969" style="s2">to create real cost real value costing</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.480" end="01:12:03.389" style="s2">and those types of things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.969" end="01:12:05.480" style="s2">true but I was under weighting how much</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.389" end="01:12:08.429" style="s2">there is a power-law distribution of</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.480" end="01:12:10.710" style="s2">economic and political power we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.429" end="01:12:13.110" style="s2">relatively few people have extremely</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.710" end="01:12:15.719" style="s2">outsized capability relative to most</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.110" end="01:12:17.309" style="s2">people and what did it take</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.719" end="01:12:19.770" style="s2">psychologically for them to get there</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.309" end="01:12:21.690" style="s2">and then that being there they have both</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.770" end="01:12:23.159" style="s2">the motive and capacity to continue to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.690" end="01:12:24.600" style="s2">stay there and what does it take to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.159" end="01:12:25.940" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.600" end="01:12:33.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.940" end="01:12:37.409" style="s2">so these are some of the questions that</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.000" end="01:12:40.230" style="s2">are on my mind Thank You Daniel thank</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.409" end="01:12:43.260" style="s2">you for sharing your thoughts and just</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.230" end="01:12:45.420" style="s2">also I think I want to say that always</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.260" end="01:12:47.540" style="s2">present in these conversations is kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.420" end="01:12:50.699" style="s2">of a way to think about our thinking to</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.540" end="01:12:53.550" style="s2">have a little bit of a meta glimpse into</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.699" end="01:12:55.980" style="s2">some of our habitual patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.550" end="01:12:57.449" style="s2">thinking and easy answers</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.980" end="01:13:00.449" style="s2">and I really appreciated about our</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.449" end="01:13:02.340" style="s2">conversations that I walk away with more</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.449" end="01:13:04.500" style="s2">things to think about than I had when I</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.340" end="01:13:06.929" style="s2">started the conversation so I don&#39;t walk</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.500" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">away with with like oh I learned a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.929" end="01:13:10.380" style="s2">of stuff from Daniel I use it always</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:12.360" style="s2">walk away from these conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.380" end="01:13:15.960" style="s2">I have a bunch of things to think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.360" end="01:13:18.179" style="s2">now and I&#39;ll say to our audience here</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.960" end="01:13:20.099" style="s2">that there&#39;s anything in this</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.179" end="01:13:21.570" style="s2">conversation that is giving you</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.099" end="01:13:24.179" style="s2">something to think about get a pencil on</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.570" end="01:13:27.659" style="s2">paper or your device out and write down</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.179" end="01:13:30.030" style="s2">that thing that it&#39;s kind of stuck with</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.659" end="01:13:32.340" style="s2">you you know what is something that that</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.030" end="01:13:35.610" style="s2">that you might think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.340" end="01:13:38.250" style="s2">a little bit more and I would say you</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.610" end="01:13:41.610" style="s2">know our conversations my you know as a</p>

<p begin="01:13:41.610" end="01:13:46.200" style="s2">thinker you know some of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.160" end="01:13:48.510" style="s2">conversations we&#39;ve had have taken me</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.200" end="01:13:50.160" style="s2">years to sort through the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.510" end="01:13:52.860" style="s2">questions I wrote down after a single</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.160" end="01:13:54.030" style="s2">conversation and that to me you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.860" end="01:13:56.580" style="s2">you&#39;re saying hey can you be around</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.030" end="01:13:57.870" style="s2">somebody that that thinks differently</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.580" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2">they do that offers you an opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.870" end="01:14:02.220" style="s2">to upgrade your thinking or upgrade your</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:05.130" style="s2">sense making it I says it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.220" end="01:14:06.390" style="s2">listening to you it&#39;s actually being</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.130" end="01:14:08.130" style="s2">willing to grapple with something you</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.390" end="01:14:09.270" style="s2">said and I would be willing to bet that</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.130" end="01:14:10.380" style="s2">some of things I&#39;ve grappled with you</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.270" end="01:14:11.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know you said to me in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.380" end="01:14:13.740" style="s2">certain degree and I&#39;ve taken me a long</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.760" end="01:14:16.290" style="s2">way and and it&#39;s actually driven a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.740" end="01:14:17.670" style="s2">of growth and I think that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.290" end="01:14:19.200" style="s2">what we hope you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.670" end="01:14:22.920" style="s2">building out projects really about is</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.200" end="01:14:25.920" style="s2">how do we help each other to to lean</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.920" end="01:14:27.090" style="s2">away from the easy answers and lean into</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.920" end="01:14:30.870" style="s2">the things that we have to grapple with</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.090" end="01:14:32.970" style="s2">and and out of that there&#39;s a maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.870" end="01:14:34.580" style="s2">maybe misplaced and hopefully not</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.970" end="01:14:37.110" style="s2">misplaced belief that we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.580" end="01:14:39.780" style="s2">move the whole thing towards thriving</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.110" end="01:14:42.510" style="s2">for for greater numbers of people and in</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.780" end="01:14:46.230" style="s2">regards to your last point that we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.510" end="01:14:47.910" style="s2">have people that aren&#39;t sociopaths make</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.230" end="01:14:50.910" style="s2">a larger contribution to the world with</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.910" end="01:14:56.060" style="s2">it can I add something to what you just</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.910" end="01:14:58.860" style="s2">said my goal is it yeah I think people</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.060" end="01:15:01.080" style="s2">sometimes think that learning is mostly</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.860" end="01:15:02.700" style="s2">this process of reading or watching</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.080" end="01:15:04.260" style="s2">something or taking in information and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.700" end="01:15:06.600" style="s2">it&#39;s actually mostly the grappling with</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.260" end="01:15:08.370" style="s2">it it&#39;s mostly the digestion and</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.600" end="01:15:10.680" style="s2">processing where it becomes your own and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.370" end="01:15:12.000" style="s2">the most insightful thing do you usually</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.680" end="01:15:13.440" style="s2">get from a book wasn&#39;t written in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.000" end="01:15:15.060" style="s2">book it was your own insights that came</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.440" end="01:15:19.890" style="s2">from really contemplating and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.060" end="01:15:21.840" style="s2">researching and checking it out and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.890" end="01:15:23.640" style="s2">you know we all know this in learning</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.840" end="01:15:25.110" style="s2">theory that when you start to teach</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.640" end="01:15:27.450" style="s2">something you start to learn in a new</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.110" end="01:15:28.830" style="s2">way because now you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.450" end="01:15:30.360" style="s2">be able to explain the questions and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.830" end="01:15:32.280" style="s2">have to do something with it right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.360" end="01:15:33.900" style="s2">this way so often someone will read</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.280" end="01:15:36.330" style="s2">something and they can recall a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.900" end="01:15:39.120" style="s2">small percentage because it there hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.330" end="01:15:41.700" style="s2">yet been an evolutionary impulse to say</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.120" end="01:15:42.900" style="s2">this matters enough to remember it</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.700" end="01:15:45.030" style="s2">because I was just reading it but when I</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.900" end="01:15:46.170" style="s2">think about why is this relevant what</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.030" end="01:15:48.270" style="s2">will I do with it it starts</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.170" end="01:15:50.690" style="s2">to kind of neurologically store</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.270" end="01:15:50.690" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.949" end="01:15:56.969" style="s2">so in general when I&#39;m reading I</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.949" end="01:15:58.980" style="s2">actually read pretty slowly</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.969" end="01:16:01.170" style="s2">because I&#39;m reading something and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.980" end="01:16:03.030" style="s2">I&#39;m looking up references and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.170" end="01:16:04.140" style="s2">thinking about it and I&#39;m relating it</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.030" end="01:16:06.630" style="s2">with various other things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.140" end="01:16:08.219" style="s2">known and so it&#39;s more like reading as</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.630" end="01:16:11.100" style="s2">the center of a research process</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.219" end="01:16:12.960" style="s2">right and the difference my friend</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.100" end="01:16:15.150" style="s2">Jordan Hall talks about simulated</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.960" end="01:16:20.610" style="s2">thinking versus real thinking simulated</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.150" end="01:16:21.719" style="s2">thinking is I&#39;m running a thought and</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.610" end="01:16:23.130" style="s2">then I&#39;m saying maybe it&#39;s this other</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.719" end="01:16:24.570" style="s2">thought and I&#39;m just running other I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.130" end="01:16:26.699" style="s2">running thoughts that have all entered</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.570" end="01:16:28.890" style="s2">my head from some external place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.699" end="01:16:31.949" style="s2">not really thinking in right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.890" end="01:16:35.130" style="s2">basically weighing memes and deciding</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.949" end="01:16:37.830" style="s2">which ones to propagate real thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.130" end="01:16:40.500" style="s2">going to result oftentimes in me having</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.830" end="01:16:43.620" style="s2">insights that I didn&#39;t intake from</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.500" end="01:16:45.330" style="s2">anywhere and that&#39;s like what really is</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.620" end="01:16:46.590" style="s2">the answer I don&#39;t know let&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.330" end="01:16:48.630" style="s2">pick through the ones that I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.590" end="01:16:50.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say how would I even come to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.630" end="01:16:51.750" style="s2">clear on this and what is my basis to</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.280" end="01:16:55.469" style="s2">think through it so the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.750" end="01:16:57.750" style="s2">really thinking very important and even</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.469" end="01:17:00.270" style="s2">insofar as that this so the most</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.750" end="01:17:02.040" style="s2">important thing is that your your study</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.270" end="01:17:04.949" style="s2">process your sense making process will</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.040" end="01:17:06.690" style="s2">be largely mining your own sensing right</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.949" end="01:17:09.690" style="s2">it&#39;ll take something in but then minding</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.690" end="01:17:11.929" style="s2">your own capability as far as this</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.690" end="01:17:14.100" style="s2">direction of just what you take in goes</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.929" end="01:17:16.530" style="s2">because we mentioned this I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.100" end="01:17:17.790" style="s2">share a very like simple most people</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.530" end="01:17:22.050" style="s2">have probably heard this but not done it</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.790" end="01:17:23.250" style="s2">yet thing that is we&#39;ll probably do more</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.050" end="01:17:26.040" style="s2">for you than anything else we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.250" end="01:17:28.739" style="s2">about today if you do it take the social</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.040" end="01:17:29.910" style="s2">media apps off your phone if you keep</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.739" end="01:17:32.250" style="s2">your social media keep it on your</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.910" end="01:17:34.020" style="s2">computer but just don&#39;t don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.250" end="01:17:36.540" style="s2">continuously available to hijack your</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.020" end="01:17:38.190" style="s2">attention if you want to do art if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.540" end="01:17:39.750" style="s2">want to start your thing whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.190" end="01:17:41.460" style="s2">fuck it is don&#39;t have something that can</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.750" end="01:17:43.590" style="s2">continuously engage your attention so</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.460" end="01:17:44.850" style="s2">that you don&#39;t get to just be bored and</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.590" end="01:17:48.600" style="s2">then think about the thing that you care</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.850" end="01:17:50.160" style="s2">about so take them off your phone turn</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.600" end="01:17:52.110" style="s2">all the notifications off on your phone</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.160" end="01:17:55.590" style="s2">or almost all of them if you want text</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.110" end="01:17:57.660" style="s2">or whatever term and then if you keep</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.590" end="01:17:59.420" style="s2">social media reconfigure it where you go</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.660" end="01:18:01.460" style="s2">through your feed and</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.420" end="01:18:02.960" style="s2">start unfollowing everything that is not</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.460" end="01:18:07.820" style="s2">making you a better person by seeing it</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.960" end="01:18:09.020" style="s2">and then intentionally go find the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.820" end="01:18:10.489" style="s2">things you want to learn about and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.020" end="01:18:13.340" style="s2">follow them and make sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.489" end="01:18:16.250" style="s2">curating dissenting views smart</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.340" end="01:18:18.320" style="s2">dissenting views so you should be seeing</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.250" end="01:18:23.510" style="s2">things that actually kind of bother you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.320" end="01:18:25.940" style="s2">but are thoughtful those couple steps</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.510" end="01:18:28.429" style="s2">will start to help a lot yeah I can</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.940" end="01:18:34.520" style="s2">second the turning the notifications off</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.429" end="01:18:35.929" style="s2">on this thing and then I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.520" end="01:18:37.640" style="s2">lot to say about that but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.929" end="01:18:40.510" style="s2">really simple things that that can make</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.640" end="01:18:44.260" style="s2">a big difference in the quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.510" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">at a very very short period of time so</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.260" end="01:18:49.610" style="s2">thank you for that thank you for your</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">time tonight really you know like you</p>

<p begin="01:18:53.120" end="01:18:58.250" style="s2">your willingness to continue into the</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.730" end="01:19:00.440" style="s2">dialogue into the conversation and even</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.250" end="01:19:02.870" style="s2">even when it&#39;s not always there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.440" end="01:19:05.060" style="s2">even a answer to give in these questions</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.870" end="01:19:07.910" style="s2">of being willing to give it a go and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.060" end="01:19:09.770" style="s2">kind of share a perspective a place that</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.910" end="01:19:14.510" style="s2">one human being called daniel standing</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.770" end="01:19:17.390" style="s2">in and how you see things it they think</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.510" end="01:19:18.770" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s really invaluable and if</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.390" end="01:19:20.300" style="s2">anything if we could be learned to begin</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.770" end="01:19:22.190" style="s2">to stand in those places ourself and</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.300" end="01:19:25.040" style="s2">kind of speak with some similar clarity</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.190" end="01:19:27.199" style="s2">I think we would see some up leveling of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.040" end="01:19:29.929" style="s2">at least our dialogue if nothing else so</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.199" end="01:19:31.040" style="s2">thank you for that and thank you Rachel</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.929" end="01:19:33.230" style="s2">was really great to have this</p>
